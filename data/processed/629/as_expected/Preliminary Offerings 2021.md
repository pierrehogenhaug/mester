**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the**

Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and

Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more)
of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the

client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no

**Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the Offering**
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared

meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”)
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus


-----

**Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by PRIIPs Regulation as it**
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and
therefore offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared
on the basis that any offer of such debt securities in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to

Rate Notes, the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes, as applicable, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any. A Change of Control Event, as defined herein, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event.

The Notes will be the general obligations of the Issuer and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is

subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, and will be pari passu in right of payment among themselves and with all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Initial Guarantees”) jointly and severally on a senior basis by the Parent, Finco and Bidco

the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors will also guarantee on a senior basis the Revolving Facility (as defined herein), certain hedging obligations, if any, and certain
operating facilities, if any. The Guarantees will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our structure—There are_

law debenture granted by each of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer over certain material assets of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer, as further described in

facilities, if any, that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral. The
Collateral may be released in circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes
will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Facility Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging obligations, if any, and certain
operating facilities, if any, have been repaid in full. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for

The distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offering and sale of the Notes in

certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. We and the Initial Purchasers require persons into
whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes to inform themselves about and to observe
any such restrictions, and neither us nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility
therefor. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase,
any of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation would be unlawful.
Notwithstanding that only we are making this offering, if applicable law in a particular jurisdiction
requires that any materials relating to the offering be distributed or communicated only by a
locally-licensed broker or dealer (and not one or more of the Initial Purchasers) in circumstances
in which one or more of the Initial Purchasers (or any affiliate of an Initial Purchaser) is such a
locally-licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by
such locally-licensed Initial Purchasers or affiliates. For a description of certain restrictions on
offers, sales and resales of Notes and distribution of this Offering Memorandum, see “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

The Notes and the Guarantees are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and

may not be transferred or resold, except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable state securities laws. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.” You should
be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite
period of time.

We have prepared this Offering Memorandum solely for use in connection with the

Offering. In the United States, you may not distribute this Offering Memorandum or make copies
of it without our prior written consent other than to people you have retained to advise you in
connection with the Offering.

This Offering Memorandum summarizes material documents and other information, and

we refer you to them for a more complete understanding of what we discuss in this Offering
Memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of the
Group and the terms of the Offering and the Notes, including the merits and risks involved. See
“Where You Can Find More Information.” You should not consider any information in this
Offering Memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice regarding an investment in the Notes.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering of the Notes at any time. The Initial

Purchasers, in consultation with the Issuer, reserve the right to reject any indications of interest to
subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the
full amount of the Notes sought by such purchaser. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their
affiliates may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes.

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the

Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, and we will submit this Offering Memorandum to the
Authority in connection with the listing application. We may also be required to update the
information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in its business, financial condition or
results of operations and prospects. We cannot guarantee that the Issuer’s application for listing of
and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved as of the
date of issuance of the Notes or any date thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining this listing.

principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 _Prospectus_
_Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the_ _Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as_

**European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic
Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i)
a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to**
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer
of the Notes in the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MiFID II product governance/Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target**
**market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market

assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes
is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (an “EEA
**distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;**
however, an EEA distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to and is directed only at persons who

are (i) persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(as amended, the “Order”); (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Order; (iii) outside the United Kingdom; or (iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to
engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully
be communicated or caused to be communicated, all such persons together being referred to as
“Relevant Persons.” The Notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to
subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, Relevant
Persons. This Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be
distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any
other person. Any person who is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on this Offering
Memorandum or its contents. The Notes are not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom.


-----

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA or (iii) not
a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no
key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or
distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the
UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in

the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation
and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance/Professional investors and eligible counterparties only**
**target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market

assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes
is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook,
and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a UK distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Jersey**

The Issuer has represented and agreed that it has not and will not, without the consent of

the Jersey Financial Services Commission (the “JFSC”), circulate in Jersey any offer for
subscription, sale or exchange of any securities of the Issuer or any other non-Jersey issuer unless
such offer is circulated in Jersey by a person or persons authorized to conduct investment business
under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998, as amended and (a) such offer does not for the
purposes of Article 8 of the Control of Borrowing (Jersey) Order 1958, as amended, constitute an
offer to the public, or (b) an identical offer is for the time being circulated in the United Kingdom
without contravening the FSMA and is, _mutatis mutandis, circulated in Jersey only to persons_


-----

similar to those to whom, and in a manner similar to that in which, it is for the time being circulated
in the United Kingdom.

**Guernsey**

The Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered directly to the public in or from within

the Bailiwick of Guernsey other than by persons regulated under the Protection of Investors
(Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, as amended (the “POI Law”) or to persons regulated under
any of Guernsey’s financial services regulatory laws including, without limitation, a person
licensed under the POI Law, the Banking Supervision (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, the
Regulation of Fiduciaries, Administration Businesses and Company Directors, etc. (Bailiwick of
Guernsey) Law, 2000, the Insurance Business (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2002, the Insurance
Managers and Insurance Intermediaries (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2002, the Financial Services
Commission (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, and the Registration of Non-Regulated Financial
Services Businesses (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2008, and in each case provided that the offeror
and the offering documents comply with the requirements of the POI Law and all applicable rules,
regulations and guidance notes issued by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission
(the “GFSC”).

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of

the securities laws of certain jurisdictions, including statements under the sections entitled
“Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations,” “Industry,” and “Business,” among others. In some cases, these forward-_
looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as the words
“believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “plan,”
“continue,” “ongoing,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “seek,” “should” or “would” or,
in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of
strategies, plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking
statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They may appear in a number of places
throughout this Offering Memorandum and may include statements regarding our intentions,
beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity, leverage, prospects, growth, strategies and dividend policy and the industry in
which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and

uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur
in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. You should
not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the

development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. These factors
include, among others:

    - our UK operations are subject to significant oversight by UK regulators that view our

operations as “higher risk” activities. Failure to comply with such applicable laws,
regulations and codes of practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset
management industries in the UK could result in substantial losses and the suspension,
termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business;

    - we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in jurisdictions other than the UK

in which we operate and failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and
codes of practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management industries
in these jurisdictions could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination
or impairment of our ability to conduct business;

    - following the establishment of our Fund and Investment Management business, our

fund managers, AGG Capital Management Limited, Norfin and Sagitta, are subject to
various laws, regulations and codes of practice applicable to the fund management
industry. Failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice
relating to this industry in the applicable jurisdictions could result in substantial losses
and the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business;


-----

- we are subject to oversight by, and owe contractual obligations of compliance to,

Investment Portfolio Sellers;

- we are subject to risks by virtue of the requirements applicable to DCAs and other

servicers;

- we are subject to voluntary codes of conduct;

- changes to the regulatory environment in the future in the jurisdictions in which we

operate or an increasing volume of legislation may materially adversely affect the debt
purchase and collection and fund and asset management industries and impede our
business and/or increase our costs;

- the ability to obtain, process, share and retain customer data is critical to us and is

heavily regulated by privacy, data protection and related laws in the jurisdictions in
which we operate and improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data
or a breach of data protection laws could negatively affect our reputation, business,
results of operations and financial condition;

- our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been and

may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;

- changes in the economic and/or political environment and/or the climate in the markets

in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition;

- legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the nature of the future

relationship between the UK and the European Union is likely to be a source of
instability in international markets, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty
surrounding our business and result in new regulatory challenges and costs;

- terrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war may materially and adversely affect

consumer spending, and in turn, our financial condition, financial returns and results of
operation;

- rising interest rates could impair the ability of customers to pay their debts and/or lead

to volatility in real estate prices which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition;

- there may not be sufficient supply of portfolios, or appropriately priced portfolios,

available for purchase, and a decrease in our ability to purchase portfolios could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;

- we may not be able to procure sufficient funding to purchase further portfolios as they

become available on acceptable terms or at all;


-----

- we may be unable to compete with businesses that offer higher prices for portfolios or

may otherwise face intensive competitive pressure;

- we may be unable to acquire the level or type of portfolios that we expect or have

historically acquired following the development of our Fund and Investment
Management business;

- other businesses may develop competitive advantages that we cannot match, which

may reduce our access to and success in competitive sale processes for portfolios;

- the value of our Existing Portfolios may deteriorate, or we may not be able to collect

sufficient amounts on our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio
purchases as they arise in the market;

- the statistical models and analytical tools we use in our business, including in our

calculation of ERC and Net Deal IRR, may prove to be inaccurate and we may not
achieve anticipated recoveries;

- we are highly dependent on our data analytics systems and proprietary customer

profiles, and if we lost access to such data or if the quality and quantity of such data is
reduced, or if competitors develop comparable tools, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected;

- we may not succeed in growing our Fund and Investment Management business

revenue, and Asset Management and Servicing business revenue and/or such revenue
sources may become less profitable;

- we may be unable to continue to perform our duties as a fund manager and may be

unable to raise future funds from third-party LP investors, limiting our ability to grow
and decreasing our income from management and performance fees;

- the vertical alignment of our local platforms under a fund management framework may

not prove successful;

- we might be unable to maintain key relationships necessary to conduct our business;

- we would be adversely affected if third parties, including DCAs, law firms and

servicers performing servicing and other collections activities on our, the Fund’s or
future funds’ portfolios, perform poorly or fail to comply with applicable laws and
regulatory requirements;

- our growth may strain our resources, affect our ability to maintain our levels of

collections or affect our ability to implement effective portfolio pricing standards,
which could materially adversely affect our business;

- we may make acquisitions or pursue joint ventures, business combinations or other

investments that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources;


-----

- companies that we have acquired, are in the process of acquiring or may acquire in the

future may have liabilities that are not known to us that could subject us to liabilities
or contingent liabilities that could otherwise have an adverse impact on us, and the
indemnity the sellers have agreed to provide may not compensate us in full or at all;

- our operations are highly dependent upon access to, and the functioning and security

of, IT applications, systems and infrastructure. A cyber-attack within the business or
through the supply chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the
confidentiality, integrity or availability could result in financial losses, regulatory
sanctions, and reputational damage;

- we outsource most of our core IT applications, systems and infrastructure to third-party

service providers and may have difficulty identifying and retaining suitable alternative
service providers;

- we may not be able to successfully anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes

within the debt purchase, fund and asset management and the financial services
industries;

- the need to adapt to customers’ changing circumstances and changes to real-estate

markets may result in increased Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs,
reduced cash flow or imprecise modeling;

- uneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the purchase

opportunities we would like to, and may result in us experiencing uneven cash flows
and financial results;

- errors in our collection process or other operational matters could have a negative effect

on our business and reputation;

- negative attention and news regarding the debt purchase and collection industry and

individual debt purchasers or collectors, including us and our Fund and Investment
Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses, may have a negative
impact on a customer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to us and may diminish our
attractiveness as a counterparty for Investment Portfolio Sellers and other third parties;

- our senior management team members and key employees are important to our

continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team
or one or more of our key employees could materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations;

- increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively

affect our business;

- a portion of our collections depends on success in individual lawsuits and court

processes. In pursuing legal collections, we may be unable to obtain accurate and
authentic account documents for some of the accounts that we purchase;


-----

- we may purchase or service portfolios that contain accounts that are not eligible to be

collected, including due to defects in customer documentation that may make the
customer agreements unenforceable;

- limitations and requirements imposed by Investment Portfolio Sellers of portfolios on

us may hinder our operational flexibility;

- examinations and challenges by tax authorities, or changes in tax laws or regulations,

or the application thereof, could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations;

- we are subject to ongoing risks of litigation under consumer credit, collections and

other laws;

- we may be held liable for the acts of third parties if we fail to develop, implement,

monitor and enforce our own risk and compliance policies. We may be held liable for
the acts of third parties, including DCAs’, if we fail to implement and maintain
sufficient oversight arrangements;

- the failure of our confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary processes and

systems could materially adversely affect our business ;

- we use a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated

financial statements, which could prove to be incorrect or cause our earnings to
fluctuate;

- Forward Flow Agreements may contractually require us to purchase portfolios at a

higher price than desired;

- we are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;

- derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses;

- Bidco has made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may

prove to be materially inaccurate;

- the Target Group may have liabilities that are not known to us;

- certain of the Group’s contracts contain change of control provisions, which may allow

counterparties to terminate such contracts under circumstances such as the Acquisition;

- we have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted annualized

data and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS;

- this Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and

assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties;


-----

    - risks relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees; and

    - risks relating to our structure.

See “Risk Factors” for further details.

The foregoing factors and other factors described under “Risk Factors” should not be

construed as exhaustive. We do not assume any obligation, and do not intend, to update any
forward-looking statements and disclaim any obligation to update our view of any risks or
uncertainties described herein or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to the forwardlooking statements made in this Offering Memorandum, except as required by law.

We urge you to carefully read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk

_Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations,” “Industry” and “Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could_
affect our future performance, our industry and the markets in which we operate. In light of these
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Offering
Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, prospective investors should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on
which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting
in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements
orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to,
press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other
communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum contains information concerning our industry

generally, which is forward-looking in nature and based on a variety of assumptions regarding the
ways in which our industry will develop. We have based these assumptions on information
currently available to us, including through the market research and industry reports referred to in
this Offering Memorandum. Although we believe that this information is reliable, we have not
independently verified and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. If any one or more of
these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual market results may differ from those predicted.
While we do not know what impact any such differences may have on our business, if there are
such differences, they could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and
financial condition, and on the trading price of the Notes.

Unless required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements

contained in this Offering Memorandum to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or
changes in factors affecting these statements.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

The market and competitive position data in the sections “Summary,” “Risk Factors,”

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
“Industry” and “Business” of this Offering Memorandum are estimates by management based on
industry publications, and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party industry data providers
that are generally believed to be reliable. However, the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed and has not been independently verified. Additionally, industry
publications and such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been
obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such
information is not guaranteed and in some instances the sources do not assume liability for such
information. We have obtained certain of the market and industry data presented in this Offering
Memorandum from a report prepared by a leading international management consultant which was
commissioned by us in connection with the Acquisition (as defined herein) (the **“Consultant**
**Report”) as well as reports produced by third-party industry specialists such as Bloomberg,**
Deloitte, Debtwire, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Thomson Reuters, and we have
obtained consent from them to reproduce certain of their non-public data in this Offering
Memorandum. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such data, and we have
not independently verified such market data and such data should not be relied upon in making, or
refraining from making, any investment decision. We do, however, accept responsibility for the
correct reproduction of this information.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the non-performing loan (“NPL”) industry has been

adversely affected. Accordingly, the industry publications, surveys or studies by third-party data
providers referred to in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect certain aspects of
the NPL industry as they may not contemplate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our business, financial condition, cash flows and_

**Financial Information for the Target Group**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain audited financial information for the

years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which has been derived from (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of AGG as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the
“2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), (ii) the audited consolidated financial
statements of AGG as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Audited
**Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (iii) the audited consolidated financial statements of**


-----

AGG as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Audited Consolidated Financial
**Statements” and together with the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2019**
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”).
The 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2019 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU, and the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted
pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), our independent
auditors, without qualification, as stated in their respective audit opinions included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum. We have included the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, we also present in this

Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information for the six months ended June 30,
2021 (with comparative information for the six months ended June 30, 2020), which has been
derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of AGG as of and for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 (the “Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements,” and together with
the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a similar basis as the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements described above, but under the requirements of IAS 34
regarding interim financial statements. KPMG has conducted a review of the consolidated
financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and
2021 in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2410, as stated
in their review report included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Independent
_Auditors” for further details. We have included the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements_
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition to the above, this Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information

of AGG on a consolidated basis for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. This information was
calculated by taking the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of AGG and adding those
to the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and subtracting the unaudited consolidated
financial statements of AGG for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The consolidated financial
information of AGG for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 has been prepared solely for the
purposes of this Offering Memorandum and is for illustrative purposes only. The consolidated
financial information of AGG for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 is not necessarily
representative of the Target’s or the Parent’s results of operations for any future period or their
financial condition at any future date, is unaudited and is not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting or in accordance with IFRS.

We use certain defined terms in this Offering Memorandum to refer to certain items in the

Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Use of Terms” for the relevant definitions. The following
table sets forth the defined terms used and the corresponding items in the Target Group’s
consolidated financial statements:


-----

**As used in this Offering Memorandum** **As presented in the Target Group’s**
**consolidated financial statements**

Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility[(1)] Revolving credit facility

Balance Sheet Statement of Financial Position

Balance Sheet Cash Collections Collections in the year

Existing Notes[(2)] Senior secured notes

Non-Recourse Facilities[(3)] ABS /Asset-backed loan

Miscellaneous Facilities[(3)] Bank overdrafts

(1) Drawings under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility were repaid on or about October 19, 2021 with a portion of the drawings under
the Revolving Facility and the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility was cancelled on such date.

(2) We intend to redeem the Existing Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the Offering.

(3) We do not intend to repay and cancel the Non-Recourse Facilities and the Miscellaneous Facilities with the proceeds of the Offering.

Further, the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been re-presented in the

2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-presentation relates to certain balance
sheet items including (i) the inclusion of £26.6 million of bank balances within cash and cash
equivalents, that were previously shown within trade and other receivables (this cash balance may
be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated
securitization structure awaiting a payment date); and (ii) the reclassification of £21.7 million from
‘other operating expenses’ to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ as part of the change
in the segmental reporting structure as a result of the Target Group now being managed through
an integrated asset management model. The total impact on operating expenses as a result of the
reclassification is nil. For further information on the re-presentation of the 2019 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations” and_
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information.”

As noted above, the Target Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with

IFRS, which differs in various significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). In making an investment decision, you should rely upon your
own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial information contained in this
Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own professional advisors for an understanding
of the differences between IFRS on one hand and U.S. GAAP on the other hand, and how those
differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

The results of operations for prior fiscal years may not be necessarily indicative of the

results to be expected for any future period. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with IFRS requires the Target Group to use certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Target Group’s accounting
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are described in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

After the completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate

consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results
at the level of the Parent. Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the
Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our
future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may


-----

not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this
Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Factors Impacting Comparability—Reporting.”_

On the Issue Date, ACMH, ACML and ACML’s subsidiaries will be Unrestricted

Subsidiaries and therefore not subject to the restrictions under the Indenture. No separate
financial information for ACMH and its subsidiaries is included in this Offering Memorandum
and the results of these Unrestricted Subsidiaries are consolidated in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2021,
the consolidated EBITDA generated by such Unrestricted Subsidiaries was £0.1 million and £1.4
million, which for the six months ended June 30, 2021, represented 2.3% of our total consolidated
EBITDA (before Acquisition costs). Further, during the twelve months ended December 31,
2020, 97% of the total revenue for the Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and
Investment businesses and total collections received by the Balance Sheet business were received
directly by Restricted Group. The remaining 3% was received by ACML, but indirectly received
by Restricted Group pursuant to recharges for services that certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries
provided to ACML. Additionally, a Restricted Subsidiary, Arrow Global Limited, holds
preferred ordinary shares in ACML, entitling it to all dividends declared and paid by the Fund
Manager.

The financial information and financial statements of the Target Group included in this

Offering Memorandum are presented in pounds sterling.

**Issuer Financial Statements**

The Issuer was incorporated on July 6, 2021, in connection with the Transactions. As of

the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is a holding company with no revenuegenerating activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or material liabilities,
other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions, including
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions. Further, Finco was incorporated on
July 29, 2021 and Bidco was incorporated on March 29, 2021, in connection with the Transactions.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, each of Finco and Bidco are holding companies with
no revenue-generating activities of their own, and no business operations, material assets or
material liabilities, other than those incurred in connection with their respective incorporations and
the Transactions, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions. As a result,
no financial information of the Issuer, Finco or Bidco is included in this Offering Memorandum,
except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented at the level of the Parent on a
consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. The Issuer is currently
not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions and any other
future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture.

**Parent Financial Statements**

The Parent was incorporated on March 29, 2021, in connection with the Transactions. The

Acquisition by the Parent of the Target Group was completed on October 11, 2021. Prior to
completion of the Acquisition, the Parent was a holding company with no revenue-generating
activities of its own, and no business operations, material assets or material liabilities, other than


-----

those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. As a result, no historical
financial information of the Parent is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain
limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain
effects of the Transactions. After completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare
separate consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated
financial results at the level of the Parent.

**Other Financial Information**

**_Financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS_**

Measures and ratios that are presented in, or derived from measures that are presented in

the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS, consist of the
following:

    - “Balance Sheet Cash Collections,” which are presented in our consolidated financial

statements and mean cash collections on our existing portfolio investments including
ordinary course portfolio sales and put-backs;

    - “Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs,” which are presented in our

statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and represent the direct
costs of collections related to our portfolio investments such as salaries, commissions
paid to third-party outsourced providers, credit bureau data costs and legal costs
associated with collections, as well as the costs of collecting our Fund and Investment
Management revenue and Asset Management and Servicing revenue;

    - “Effective Interest Rate” or “EIR,” which means under IFRS the rate that exactly

discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the
financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount
of the financial asset or financial liability. For us, this typically means that the EIR is
set based on forecast 84-Month ERC at the date of purchase and the loan portfolio
purchase price. EIR is reassessed and may be adjusted up to 12 months after the
purchase of each loan portfolio. For portfolio investments measured at fair value
through the profit and loss, the EIR typically is calculated using the to the lifetime ERC
rather than an 84-Month ERC;

    - “Existing Portfolios,” which mean all investment portfolios that we own at the relevant

point in time, which are shown as “portfolio investments” on our balance sheet; and

    - “Working capital adjustments,” which included, historically, the net movement on

debtors and creditors, excluding the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, NonRecourse Facilities, the 2024 Notes and related accrued interest, the 2025 Notes and
related accrued interest and the 2026 Notes and related accrued interest, and
corporation tax debtors and creditors. Following completion of the Transactions,
“working capital adjustments” will include the net movement on debtors and creditors,
excluding the Revolving Facility, Non-Recourse Facilities, the Notes and related
accrued interest, and corporation tax debtors and creditors.


-----

**_Financial measures not prepared in accordance with IFRS_**

We use certain financial measures and related ratios to measure our performance, including

measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS. We believe that when assessing our
financial performance, it is important to consider both IFRS measures included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and complementary measures not prepared in accordance with IFRS and not
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that these complementary measures
that are not determined in accordance with IFRS and not included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements provide investors additional useful information relating to the performance of our
purchased loan portfolios. These measures are used in the calculation of the Target Group’s IFRS
financial measures, such as total income and the balance sheet carrying value on purchased loan
portfolios, which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-IFRS measures for which we provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable

IFRS measures (and which are also subject to the qualifications described below) include the
following:

    - “Adjusted EBITDA,” which we define as profit/(loss) for the year adjusted to exclude

the effects of finance income and costs, taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities,
portfolio amortization, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains/(losses),
amortization of acquisition and bank facility fees, gain on disposal of leases,
profit/(loss) on disposal of intangible assets, share-based payments and deferred
consideration renegotiations.

We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that it may enhance an investor’s
understanding of our performance, our ability to service our debt and other obligations,
to maintain our operations and to fund our continued growth, and because it is
frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the
evaluation of companies. We provide the supplemental reconciliations of Adjusted
EBITDA to net cash flow and to Balance Sheet Cash Collections because they may
enhance an investor’s understanding of our cash flow generation that could be used to
service or pay down debt, pay income taxes, purchase new portfolio investments and
for other uses, as a supplemental measure of profitability. Further, our leverage ratio is
calculated as the ratio of Secured Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. In addition to ERC,
our management monitors Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating cash flow
because it is not impacted by such short-term non-cash movements. We believe that
Adjusted EBITDA represents the operating cash flow generation potential of the
business available for the servicing of debt and taxation, before investment decisions
in portfolio investments purchases, which are discretionary;

    - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow,” which means Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest,

income taxes and overseas taxation paid and amounts paid for the purchase of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources—Adjusted Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow_
to net cash from operating activities.


-----

We present Adjusted Free Cash Flow because we believe that similar free cash flows
measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in evaluating similar issuers. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered
as a measure of cash flow from operations under IFRS or as an indicator of liquidity.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a metric used by management and is intended to be a
measure of cash flow available for our discretionary use and before any investment in
portfolio acquisitions;

- “EBITDA” means our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of

intangible assets and foreign exchange gains and losses;

- “Net Debt,” which represents the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the 2024

Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes (in each case, until their redemption using a
portion of the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes), amounts outstanding under the
Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, the Non-Recourse Facilities, the
Miscellaneous Facilities and deferred consideration payable in relation to the
acquisition of portfolio investments and subsidiaries and associates, less cash and cash
equivalents. After giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, from
the Issue Date, Net Debt will include the amount outstanding under the Notes, the
Revolving Facility, the Non-Recourse Facilities and Miscellaneous Facilities, less cash
and cash equivalents;

- “Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA” represents our annualized Run-rate

Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted for our targeted cost savings intended as a result
of certain organizational changes and completion of strategic review.

We present Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA because it provides useful
information regarding a company’s ability to service and incur indebtedness,
particularly in light of COVID-19 pandemic-related effects on our audited historical
data, which impacted our result for the year ended December 31, 2021 and six months
ended June 30, 2021. Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the
full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operation;

- “Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA” represents our Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for

the run-rate effect of revenues from our Fund and Investment Management and Asset
Management and Servicing businesses. We also present Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
on an annualized basis which is derived by multiplying our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA
for the six months ended June 30, 2021 by two;

- “Secured Net Debt” represents our Net Debt that is secured by certain assets and

collateral; and

- “Underlying profit before tax” represents our reported profit before tax before the

deduction of exceptional costs or before the inclusion of exceptional revenues such as
exceptional collection activity costs, exceptional other operating expenses and
exceptional finance costs. The purpose of this metric is to adjust our profit for one-off
exceptional items to assist the user in understanding the underlying results.


-----

Complementary measures and ratios that are not presented in or derived from measures

that are presented in our consolidated financial statements, and are not prepared in accordance with
IFRS (and are subject to the qualifications described below), include the following:

    - “Assets under management” or “AUM,” refers to the face value of debt portfolios

that we manage or service on behalf of our clients who own the debt portfolios;

    - “Capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA,” which means sum of the

Fund and Investment Management business EBITDA and Asset Management and
Servicing business EBITDA calculated as a percentage of total EBITDA.

We present Capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA because we believe
that it enhances an investor’s understanding of our new integrated asset manager
business model and represents the percentage of our business that is capital-light and
supported by our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and
Servicing businesses;

    - “EBITDA Margin” is a measure of our EBITDA as a percentage of our total income;

    - “Funds under management” or “FUM,” means the value of all fund management

assets managed by us, including Arrow Credit Opportunities, Norfin, Europa
Investimenti, Sagitta, any of our own capital which we have committed to invest
alongside third parties committed capital and our back book;

    - “Gross IRR,” which means a loan portfolio’s gross internal rate of return and is

calculated using actual cash collections from date of purchase of the loan portfolio to
the current date, together with the forecast cash collections from the current date
adjusted regularly in line with ERC based on the same assumptions and estimates,
which together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections on the
investment portfolio.

Gross IRR, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other
companies in our industry;

    - “Leverage,” which is calculated as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA;

    - “Net Deal IRR,” which means a loan portfolio’s internal rate of return and is calculated

using actual cash collections from date of purchase of the loan portfolio to the current
date (net of servicing costs including servicing margin), together with the forecast cash
collections from the current date adjusted regularly in line with ERC (net of servicing
costs including servicing margin) based on the same assumptions and estimates, which
together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections (net of
servicing costs including servicing margin) on the investment portfolio.

Net Deal IRR, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by
other companies in our industry; and


-----

- “84-Month ERC” and “120-Month ERC” (together, “ERC”), which mean our

estimated remaining Balance Sheet Cash Collections on portfolio investments over an
84-month or 120-month period, respectively, representing the expected future Balance
Sheet Cash Collections on portfolio investments over an 84-month or 120-month
period (calculated at the end of each month, based on our proprietary ERC forecasting
model, as amended from time to time). 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are
calculated as of a point in time assuming no additional purchases are made thereafter.

84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are metrics that are also often used by other
companies in our industry. 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC, as computed by us,
may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry.

We present 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC because they represent an estimate of
the cash value of our portfolio investments at any point in time, which is an important
supplemental measure for our Board and management to assess our performance, and
underscores the cash generation capacity of the assets backing our business. We use
120-Month ERC in addition to 84-Month ERC to reflect the longer-term nature of our
collections because of our high share of financial services assets, combined with our
large proportion of Paying Accounts.

Under the Indenture, ERC will be calculated based on projected collections from
Portfolio Assets, which in turn includes a range of receivables included within the
definition of Underlying Portfolio Assets. These Underlying Portfolio Assets may be
held directly by us, or could be held by third parties. Specifically, we include within
Portfolio Assets (i) Underlying Portfolio Assets owned directly by the Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (whether such direct ownership is in whole or in part), (ii)
Underlying Portfolio Assets held by third parties as to which we have rights to collect
and retain amounts generated by such Underlying Portfolio Assets (defined in the
Indenture as Rights to Collect) and (iii) Underlying Portfolio Assets held by third
parties as to which we have contractual rights or other rights to amounts generated by
such Underlying Portfolio Assets (defined in the Indenture as Rights to Participate).
Rights to Participate cover a range of rights to share in pools or other aggregations of
receivables (based on negotiated percentages) that we do not own directly or through
equity interests. See “Description of the Notes.”

84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC are projections of our estimated remaining
collections over an 84 month-period or a 120-month period, respectively, calculated by
our proprietary ERC forecasting model, which uses our historical portfolio collection
performance data, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve such collections.
Further, we constantly refine our methods for calculating 84-Month ERC and 120Month ERC.

The balance sheet value of our portfolio investments is derived from the same
proprietary ERC forecasting model used to derive 84-Month ERC and 120-Month
ERC. The actual collection periods used for balance sheet valuation are not fixed at 84
or 120 months and vary based on our view of portfolio characteristics. Accordingly,
there are differences between the cash flow projections used to calculate 84-Month


-----

ERC and 120-Month ERC and those used in the calculation of balance sheet values of
portfolio investments.

Our computation of 84-Month ERC and 120-Month ERC could in the future differ from
the collection forecasts used to compute and record our portfolio investments on our
balance sheet.

The non-IFRS measures and other information presented in this Offering Memorandum

have been prepared for information purposes only and have not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or
reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and
other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not
be considered as alternative or substitute measures to evaluate our performance.

You should not consider the foregoing items as alternatives or substitutes to comparable

IFRS measures. Moreover, these measures and related ratios:

    - have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation;

    - are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS;

    - should not be considered as alternatives to net cash flow from operating activities or

any other measure of our liquidity derived in accordance with IFRS;

    - should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to profit/(loss) after tax or any

other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS;

    - may not be indicative of our results of operations; and

    - do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash

requirements.

In addition, these measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly

titled measures used by other companies in our industry or otherwise. You should exercise caution
in comparing these measures as reported by us to such measures of other companies.

We present the non-IFRS measures and other information (i) as they are used by our

management to monitor and report to the board on financial position and (ii) to present similar
measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties
as supplemental measures of financial position, financial performance and liquidity. We believe
these non-IFRS measures and other information enhance the investor’s understanding of our
indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet
and service our obligations, including our obligations under the Notes.

The non-IFRS measures and other information are based on available information and

certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However,
these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant
business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition

or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information presented in this Offering
Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not
be subject to review by the SEC.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling. Figures expressed

in currencies other than pounds sterling have been converted at the relevant exchange rate
applicable as of the date of the balance sheet included in such Consolidated Financial Statements.
In addition, certain measures in this Offering Memorandum are presented on a constant exchange
rate basis to enhance their comparability period-to-period. To calculate such measures on a
constant exchange rate basis, we have adjusted the prior period item such that the foreign currency
conversion applied to that item is made using the same exchange rate as was applied to that item
in the current period.

**_As Adjusted Financial Information_**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain information and certain ratios that give

effect to the Offering and the use of the proceeds thereof to effect the Transactions, as described
in “Summary—The Transactions.” The adjustments assume that the Transactions occurred on July
1, 2020 (with respect to consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
data) or June 30, 2021 (with respect to consolidated balance sheet data).

The _as adjusted_ financial information is for informational purposes only and does not

necessarily present what our results would actually have been had the Offering and the
Transactions actually occurred on July 1, 2020 (with respect to consolidated statement of profit or
loss and other comprehensive income data) or June 30, 2021 (with respect to consolidated balance
sheet data), and should not be used as the basis of projections for our results of operations or
financial condition for any future period. The as adjusted financial information is not calculated
in accordance with IFRS, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
S-X of the SEC, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally
accepted accounting standards, and has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with applicable
auditing standards. Any reliance you place on this information should fully take this into
consideration.

**_Illustrative Data_**

This Offering Memorandum also contains certain illustrative data. The illustrative data are

intended to provide a high-level overview of our business model, and to provide background for
some of our key financial metrics, which, we believe, is beneficial to investors. They have not
been prepared on the basis of any recognized accounting framework or in accordance with any
recognized accounting guidance. The illustrative data are based on hypothetical assumptions, and
as such may not give a fair and accurate view of our future financial position, results of operations,
cash flows or prospects.

**_Presentation_**

References in this Offering Memorandum in the context of annual financial periods to a

year (e.g., “2018,” “2019” and “2020”) are to the financial year ended or ending December 31 of
such year.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_The information set forth in this summary does not contain all the information you should consider_
_before making your investment decision. You should carefully read this entire Offering_
_Memorandum, including “Risk Factors” and the Target Group’s_ _financial statements, before_
_making your investment decision. This summary contains forward-looking statements that contain_
_risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly in the future as a result of_
_factors such as those set forth in “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Overview**

Established in 2005, we are a leading European investor and asset manager of debt in the

non-performing and non-core assets sector, principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the
Netherlands, Italy and the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”). As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8
billion of FUM, £1,028 million in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733
million 120-month ERC, and, in the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free
Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7 million.

We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions

that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “Business—Our businesses” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our
_Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and, as_
such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in
our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below:

1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management_
business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes
the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit
Opportunities (the “Fund”), with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion,
together with Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta;

2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms_
service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments,
on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance
Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading
positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with
expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME non-performing loans
(“NPLs”) and non-core asset servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we
operate; and

3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the_
deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way
of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership,
Arrow Global SMA I LP (“Arrow SMA”). Going forward, we expect the Balance
Sheet business to function primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities
alongside the Fund as well as any future funds. We may, however, continue to make

direct investments through this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance
Sheet business also incorporates the financial performance of the back book
portfolio investments made prior to the launch of the Fund.

Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and

Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive
risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these
portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms.

We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and non
core loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional
fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce
their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and
managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing
European market.

Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients,

communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving
fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve
their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and
receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate.

Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing

NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and
diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key
European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having
operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class
provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced
“on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller
transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive
advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of
off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an
auction-like process).

Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio

investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals,
our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive
European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a
high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database
incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten
since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across
multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which
focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and
Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our
financial characteristics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Our Business Model.”_


-----

As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model

delivers:

    - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by

our Balance Sheet business;

    - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital
light businesses;

    - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own

balance sheet to provide returns; and

    - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required

for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business.

To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record

and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund
represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit
fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in
Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined
with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to
raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.

**Our Key Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Attractive market with strong growth drivers._**

We are a leading European investor and asset manager in the non-performing and non-core

assets sector principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, with a
15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Debt originators generally use debt sales as a method for managing the economic,

regulatory and commercial aspects of continued ownership of defaulted loans and non-core assets
and to accelerate capital release for debts that are already fully or heavily provisioned. The debt
purchase and debt servicing industry is a significant component of the debt recovery process in
many markets and provides an attractive solution for debt originators facing increasing capital and
liquidity regulatory requirements, thereby ultimately benefiting customers. See “Industry—The
_debt collection and debt servicing market.” Our business model is designed to benefit from_
economic dislocation, which leads to an increase in the generation of non-performing and noncore assets. Even prior to the recent economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our
addressable market was very large, at approximately €1.0 trillion. Over half of these assets still sit
on bank balance sheets and will need to be sold in due course into the capital markets, where the
largest investors are often distressed debt funds. See “Industry—Market participants” and


-----

“Industry—Alternative investment management—Market participants: fund and asset managers.”
Although these assets are created continually, the rise in the level of NPLs is closely tied to periods
of economic downturn. This trend was evident following the global financial crisis in 2007 and
2008, where an extremely large number of NPLs were created. The economic dislocation resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic is already resulting in historically high bank provisioning for bad
loans, which we expect will begin to be sold in significant volumes in the coming years. See
“Industry—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” Our current internal forecast, based on our
analysis of bank provisions and forecast defaults, suggests to us that the economic impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic will lead to an increase of approximately 50% in our addressable market.
This equates to approximately €500 billion of additional NPLs having been or being created on
bank balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2020, the non performing exposures (“NPE”) volume in EU banks

(including the UK) decreased to €528 billion (compared to €584 billion in December 2019), with
the year over year drop primarily driven by a significant increase in the support measures
implemented to soften the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPL transaction activity was
muted during 2020, marking a slowdown from previous years (total transaction activity of €77.8
billion, down 35% compared to 2019 and down 62% compared to 2018). We believe the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic will increase transaction activity in 2021, which will in turn create
new market opportunities. ECB 2020 stress tests suggest that NPLs levels could reach €1.4 trillion
once COVID-19 related financial relief measures are withdrawn (as compared to a €1.2 trillion
peak in 2015). See “ Industry—The European NPL _market.”_

Further, our presence within some of the largest European NPL jurisdictions, being Italy,

UK, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland, puts us in a position to benefit from what we believe
will be the greatest market prospect for non-performing assets since the global financial crisis in
2007/2008. The volume of NPLs in our primary markets is significant, as illustrated below:

_Sources: Company information, ECB, EBA Risk Dashboard, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPL_
_market._

Prior to the current economic dislocation, European banks’ NPL ratios had only just begun

to approach the levels targeted by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) and the ECB. This
had followed significant regulatory pressure for banks to recognize impaired assets and
subsequently deleverage on an expedited basis. The result was a period of transformational
European bank balance sheet restructuring that led to over €700 billion of assets being sold from
bank balance sheets into the capital markets. We anticipate that the wave of new non-performing
assets that is projected to be created following the current COVID-19-related economic dislocation
will continue to mean that regulation is likely to prioritize bank deleveraging, resulting in another
large wave of non-performing asset sales in the coming years. See “Industry—The impact of the


-----

_COVID-19 pandemic.” In addition to presenting investment opportunities, increased deleveraging_
by European banks is also expected to present significant asset servicing opportunities for our
Asset Management and Servicing business, which we believe we are well positioned to take
advantage of. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and
_standardization.”_

The overall declining trend in total EU NPL volumes during 2020 has been driven by the

relief measures adopted to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Over the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, €900 billion of European loans received
support through EBA-eligible moratoria. Our forward outlook is foreseen by the increase in Stage
2 loans (9.1% in December 2020 as compared to 6.5% in December 19). The proportion of Stage
2 loans under moratoria is 26.4%, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria
expire. The chart below illustrates the large proportion of non-expired Stage 2 loans under
moratoria.

_Sources: EBA Risk Dashboard, KPMG Navigating European distressed markets - European debt sales 2021, Deloitte,_

_Deleveraging Europe June 2021._

When government measures and moratoria come to an end, even a subset of these loans

souring to NPL would cause banks to face a significant challenge, with a material rise in NPLs
volumes, thereby creating market opportunities for new contract wins and investments. According
to market consensus, the new flows will push banks to react with significant and prompt disposal
processes, with the aim of remaining in line with their NPL maximum holding levels. According
to PwC’s July 2021 report on the Italian NPL Market, up to €100 billion of distressed credits are
expected to flow in the next 24-30 months in Italy alone, one of the largest NPL markets in Europe
and one of our key markets.

We are also highly active in the growing secondary market including purchasing NPLs and

other non-core assets already serviced by our own platforms. Asset sales to NPL and other noncore asset buyers have grown dramatically in recent years in our key markets, suggesting a large
secondary market. A typical non-performing asset portfolio has a long life, with cash collections
often generated for over ten years. The majority of the over €700 billion of assets that have been
sold by European banks in recent years have been purchased by large distressed asset funds. These
asset funds are the largest buyers of non-performing assets in the market. Non-performing assets


-----

are typically held in a closed-end fund structure and then sold at the end of that fund’s life. Based
on our analysis of previous transactions in the market, we estimate that an additional €300 billion
of NPLs will be generated in the market over the next four years. A large number of these NPLs
already sit on our servicing platforms, providing us with a unique pipeline of potential investment
opportunities, the performance of which can be forecast with a degree of certainty. This greatly
enhances risk-adjusted returns should we elect to purchase such assets, which we often do. Our
significant estimated secondary sale market in our geographies is illustrated in the chart below.

_Sources: Company data; PwC, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPLs market._

Fundraising from LP investors is also an important dynamic for our development and our

offering is highly attractive to the growing number of LP investors looking to allocate to private
debt. In fact, approximately 81% of the LP investors surveyed indicated that they expected to
increase their allocation to alternative investments, including private debt strategies, to more than
double the current levels over the next five years from 2% to 5%, according to a 2020 Preqin article
regarding the future of alternatives in 2025. Our 2020 fundraise of the Fund represented one of the
more successful fundraises of 2020, with the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally,
third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally and fourth largest private equity
fundraise in Europe. See “Industry—Alternative investment management.” The fundraising took
place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created various operational issues, including, among
others, that LP investors were unable to conduct in-person due diligence in respect of the Fund
Manager. However, despite these unprecedented operational hurdles, we successfully facilitated
interactions with over 100 LP investors throughout the Fund’s fundraising process and we believe
that such interactions have led to the formation of a strong pipeline of potential LP investors for
future fundraising.

There is also an increasing propensity for banks and other debt originators to outsource

their arrears or defaulted accounts collection activities which are not considered a core competency
for them. See “See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and
_standardization.” However, collection activities remain a core competency for our Asset_
Management and Servicing business. This shift to outsourcing collection activities has increased
given the COVID-19 pandemic and is an additional market development that we believe will be
beneficial for our Asset Management and Servicing business. Throughout 2020, we secured a


-----

record 26 new contract wins, a further 11 new contracts in the first half of 2021 and we believe
that we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner to financial
institutions.

**_Strong track record of being a leading European investor and asset manager._**

We have a strong track record of delivering superior returns, even during periods of

economic dislocation, which has provided us with the strong platform to transition to our integrated
asset manager model and raise funds from yield-seeking LP investors in the Fund. We believe that
the following five factors have been critical in establishing our track record of delivering high IRR
on our portfolio investments:

    - our people with significant experience and a deep bench of management experience;

    - local know-how of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across

attractive European markets;

    - strong origination capabilities with broad reach allowing us to acquire a high level of

off-market deals;

    - leading data analytics capabilities, which enable us to underwrite portfolios with

accuracy; and

    - experience in capital partnering where we have regularly partnered with third-party

funds as a minority investor.

Our track record has delivered a 17% Net Deal IRR since 2010 (despite the ERC write

down as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic), including the track record of acquired businesses.
Our performance by vintage year, shown in the chart below, has driven the results of our Balance
Sheet business and also presents a compelling risk/return proposition for LP investors with
consistent outperformance against relevant benchmarks, such as the high yield index, as illustrated
below:

_Source: Company information._

Our differentiated origination strategy targets high levels of off-market deals, leveraging

off of our strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise on a granular basis. During
2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our total deals were acquired off-market, where deals tend


-----

to be smaller (€5 to €40 million investments) and typically deliver higher returns. Such
opportunities are only generated from our deep market connections and experienced in-country
NPL and non-core asset operational teams. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Portfolio investments.” The benefit of our differentiated origination strategy is_
illustrated by the chart below, showing an incremental 5% increase to the Net Deal IRR of
off-market deals (18% as of June 30, 2021) compared to on-market transactions (13% as of June
30, 2021) executed through competitive tender processes.

Our track record was impacted by the ERC write down in the first half of 2020 with an

overall 2% reduction in the average Net Deal IRR (all deals since 2010) from December 2019 to
December 2020. However, the recovery is already underway, driven by the over-performance in
actual collections against the ERC and the returns achieved on more recent vintages has already
led to a 1% Net Deal IRR recovery.

_Source: Company information and internal calculations._

Furthermore, we have strong actual cash realization, and therefore, we have demonstrable

evidence that our actual cash collections performance is in line with our underwriting assumptions
at the current point in time. As of June 30, 2020, we had realized above 100% of expected cash
receipts, per our underwriting curves, in eight out of twelve years (i.e., 2010 to 2021). Our 2017
vintage had two large underperforming deals as a result of collection challenges caused by the
counterparty’s bankruptcy and systems integration challenges and our 2018 and 2019 vintages
have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in court closures and therefore
impacted our ability to make cash collections. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” However, given the over-performance against_
the current forecast ERC, there is opportunity for recovery of these vintages over time. Notably,
the 2020 and 2021 vintages show strong cash recovery of 230% and 296% respectively. The strong
performance of our vintages is illustrated by the chart below.


-----

-----

As mentioned above and exhibited in the graphic below, we have demonstrated consistent

growth of collections and Adjusted EBITDA, with only a slowdown in 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic.

**_Integrated asset manager is a unique model not replicated by other market participants._**

Following the establishment of our Fund Manager and the raising of the Fund, we have

transitioned to an integrated asset manager model, which we believe is unique in our market and
enables our three businesses: the Fund and Investment Management, Asset Management and
Servicing and Balance Sheet to operate synergistically. Our Fund and Investment Management
business originates new investment opportunities, that our Balance Sheet business can co-invest
into and our Asset Management and Servicing business can then service.

We expect our Balance Sheet business to continue to co-invest alongside fund investments,

with a participation of 25% for the Fund and a lower participation, approximately 10%, for
subsequent funds. Our Asset Management and Servicing business currently services 71% of the
Fund’s investments and the Fund pays market referenced fees for such services. The integrated
asset manager model enables us to increase capital-light income, through management and
performance fees generated by our Fund and Investment Management business and asset
management and servicing fees delivered by our Asset Management and Servicing business.

We believe that there are two fundamental benefits to our integrated asset manager model.

Firstly, we can invest at scale and further build our considerable intellectual property of investing
in our chosen markets and secondly, the increase in capital-light earnings will in due course
fundamentally improve our financial profile.

Investing at scale allows us to further build intellectual property through building

origination capabilities through broadening and deepening relationships with Investment Portfolio
Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the increased level of portfolios
purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities, leading to increased
accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an enabler to create
operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing business,
allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable


-----

deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our subsequent
funds, enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the
scale of our businesses.

Furthermore, our integrated asset manager model drives an improved financial risk profile,

given the increase in capital-light earnings generated. The increase in the level of capital-light
revenues generated for each investment drives a materially different return on capital employed.
The charts below show the indicative returns for a typical balance sheet investor with a Net Deal
IRR of 18%, before any overhead allocation versus the indicative returns for us under our
integrated asset manager model, showing the build of returns driven by the capital-light revenues,
as well as the indicative returns, pre-overheads, for us of between 25% (based upon our current
25% co-investment participation) and 40% (based upon the expected approximately 10% coinvestment participation for subsequent funds).

_Source: Company information._

We expect to be able to increase income generated through management and performance

fees charged to LP investors while increasing scale benefits to the Asset Management and
Servicing business through more increased and stable servicing income. We believe that the
gradual build-up of management fees, primarily fees charged on drawn capital, will grow a stable
revenue source with future funds.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our EBITDA from our capital-light businesses was

33% of our total EBITDA. Given the losses sustained during 2020, our capital-light businesses’
percentage of Group EBITDA was negative 48.4%, but after adjusting for the non-cash write off
of ERC in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic of £133.6 million, our capital-light businesses’
percentage of Group EBITDA would have been 19.0%. Our capital-light businesses’ percentage
of Group EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) was 22.5% for the six months period ended June 30,
2021. The decrease since 2019 primarily reflects the investment in the fund management
infrastructure, which will, in due course generate higher income as FUM continue to grow.

We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the returns on capital, the build of capital-light

revenues and the reduced level of purchases by our Balance Sheet business (we expect to reduce
our co-investment participation in future funds, including ACO 2, to approximately 10% from the
current 25%) will enable us to de-lever, reduce Net Debt and, in time, materially change our
financial risk profile.


-----

**_Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms._**

Our Fund and Investment Management business has a differentiated approach from other

institutional fund managers in the market. Based on our knowledge of the market, the majority of
credit funds have a small team based in international capital centers and access the NPL and noncore asset market by mainly targeting large bank asset auctions of greater than €100 million. On
the other hand, as highlighted in the chart below, our model is predicated on leveraging our large
local presence in each of our markets, with local asset servicing businesses providing deep asset
expertise on a granular basis, to form strong relationships with potential asset sellers and develop
a detailed knowledge of a wide range of asset classes on a granular level. Our model has enabled
us to consistently make more of our investments in non-competitive, off-market bi-lateral trades
that are smaller in size and offer higher returns.

_Note: Prepared based on Company information and estimates._

Our compelling proposition is highlighted by the Fund’s support from a diversified range

of sophisticated LP investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth,
university endowments and family offices, with global commitments ranging from the UK,
Benelux, Nordics, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S.,
Canada, Australia and Asia. Further, through our fundraising, we have had interactions with over
100 LP investors creating a very strong pipeline of potential investors for future fundraises.

Furthermore, our Asset Management and Servicing business has market-leading platforms

and is well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our businesses undertake a broad range
of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization and
litigation and court process management, master servicing activities, such as legal title holding,
securitization vehicle management activities and other activities such as due diligence, onboarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection and servicing to many of the large
institutional global and European debt funds. See “Business—Our businesses—Asset Management
_and Servicing business.” Our combination of market leading positions, niche dominant platforms_


-----

and competitive specialist servicing and investment platforms across five markets position us as a
local operator with expertise in real estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing. We
achieved a record of 26 contract wins in 2020, with a further 11 new contract wins during the first
half of 2021, one of which being our acquisition of the collections and recoveries operations within
Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an
enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and
flexibility they will need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us because of our focus
on customers, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and
Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in over 200 of Tesco Bank’s personnel
transferring over to us on November 1, 2021. We have observed an increasing need for our services
from banks such as Tesco Bank given the pressure on their operations as a result of the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—
_Specialization and standardization.” The increasing use of digital mediums, with portals for self-_
service by customers, increases in our customer satisfaction scores ― we have seen an increase by
0.3 in our customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9) in 2020 ― and embedded
forbearance and vulnerable customer policies and processes have facilitated our growth and are a
key factor in the industry awards that our platforms received in 2020.

Our market-leading platforms deliver significant levels of third party contract wins which

are backed up by the recognition we have received through awards and customer satisfaction. Most
notably, in 2020 we were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’
Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin
Money. Additionally, in November 2020 we became four time finalists after being nominated at
the Credit Strategy Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business
was recognized not only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio
Management Company (Global Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer
(International Investor) and Best Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).

**_Highly cash flow generative with conservative risk management and strong balance sheet._**

We are a highly cash generative business, with strong Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, our
Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation was £156.6 million and £90.7 million respectively. The build
of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow is illustrated in the chart below.

_Source: Company information._


-----

Furthermore, we retain flexibility on the level of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow that we re
invest in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, are able to manage any peaks and troughs in
liquidity requirements. This is evidenced by the fact that during 2020 the portfolio investments
that we made amounted to £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million during 2019, as we
sought to conserve liquidity, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As we develop our capital-light businesses, we expect to reduce the level of re-investment

in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, we expect that a portion of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow
generation will support Net Debt reduction and deleveraging. We are targeting £500 million
Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation, after investment in new portfolios acquisitions for the period
2021–2025, which target we are not guaranteed to meet within the planned time frame or at all.
See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

As exhibited in the chart below, our balance sheet has both geographical and asset class

diversification. As of June 30, 2021, our 84 month ERC in the jurisdictions in which we operate
were as follows: 36% in the UK, 26% in Portugal, 21% in Italy, 15% in the Netherlands and 2%
in Ireland and, as of the same date, 66% was unsecured and 34% secured. This diversification,
together with the limited deal size of any single portfolio investment, minimizes our risk profile.

_Source: Company information._

Furthermore, as a result of the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our

conservative non-cash write down of 13.2% to our ERC as of June 30, 2020, reflected the
significant uncertainty at that time arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflective of our
cautious approach. Details of the ERC write-down are shown in the graphic below.


-----

_Source: Company information._

However, as illustrated in the charts below, we are performing well against our ERC. This

creates a significant value upside - on the basis of an 84-month ERC of £1.6 billion, a 5% overperformance in actual collections equates to an approximate upside of £50 million after
discounting. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Portfolio investments.” During_
the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter of 2020, first quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021,
our Cash Collections compared to our ERC were 141%, 111%, 106% and 131%, respectively.

**_Current strategic plan enhanced by TDR Capital ownership._**

Our management team has a deep wealth of experience and talent. Their track-record of

proven success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. The full support
of our incumbent senior management and their strategic targets, increased capital-light earnings
and reduced capital intensity, all increase our prospects of growth whilst also reducing leverage
under the new ownership of TDR Capital. Our goal of reducing leverage will be bolstered by TDR


-----

Capital’s commitment to reduce leverage (with a target of leverage being approximately 3.0 - 3.5
times by 2023) without compromising our existing risk appetite.

TDR Capital is a leading specialist buyout firm with total FUM of approximately €10

billion as of December 31, 2020 and is based in the UK. It was founded in 2002 by Manjit Dale
and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. For further details,
see “Principal Shareholders.” TDR Capital has an experienced team of investment professionals
and operating partners and a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business
services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet
management and driver mobility company. TDR Capital has a low-volume investment strategy
(one to two investments per year) based on principles developed by the investment team over the
past decade. TDR Capital seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on
operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model.

TDR Capital will provide operational best practices and fund management expertise

accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European investing and understand the structures and
culture required to enable our integrated asset manager model to thrive. TDR Capital has a strong
track record in the financial services industry, including specialty finance, leasing and insurance.
For example, TDR Capital helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of
unsecured debt, as its owner from 2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of
the value drivers and regulation relevant to the industry. TDR Capital has continued to actively
monitor the credit management industry and has closely followed our journey in public markets to
date, and believes that our team has successfully created a high quality, internationally diverse,
vertically integrated asset manager and fully supports management’s clear ambition to further
develop our capital-light based strategy.

We believe that access to their deep and trusted LP relationships and capital under TDR

Capital ownership will provide the flexibility required to expedite the development of our Fund
and Investment Management business and be instrumental in accelerating our further transition to
our capital-light model and deleveraging.

**Our Vision and Strategy**

Our vision is to be an innovative and valued partner in credit and asset management with

the purpose of building better financial futures for our customers. Our people as well as our
structure, culture and values are aligned with the delivery of our strategic objectives.

We have six key strategic objectives to support the delivery of our vision and purpose:

**_Build a scalable and sustainable fund management platform with a diverse spread of global_**
**_investors._**

The development in 2019 and 2020 of our Fund Manager has been central to the success

in raising the Fund and critical to our transition to becoming an integrated asset manager with a
capital-light business model. We believe our proposition to LP investors is both unique and
compelling, given our track record over the last 15 years, our ability to target high-return niches
in off-market trades, our use of local knowledge and experience of our local in-country teams to
drive performance and the strong underwriting discipline. We intend to further develop our Fund

and Investment Management business, through raising subsequent funds at a larger scale and
growing the number and diversity of LP investors, to put us in the best position to achieve our
target of growing FUM to approximately €10 billion (over £8.4 billion) by the end of 2025, from
our FUM of €4.8 billion (representing approximately £4.1 billion) as at June 30, 2021. We expect
to commence the fund raising for our second fund, ACO 2, when the capital deployed, after
recycling collections, within the Fund is approximately 70% of the total capital commitments
(provided that the deployment rate remains consistent with historical rates of deployment). See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

The increase in both our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and

Servicing businesses are central to our strategy of growing more stable capital-light earnings with
a target 50% EBITDA coming from such businesses by the end of 2025. In turn, we believe this
transition will be instrumental to achieving our goals of de-leveraging and reducing our Net Debt.
The chart below shows the targeted shift in our EBITDA from our move from an NPL purchaser
model to our capital-light integrated asset manager model. However, there can be no assurance
that we will achieve such target within the targeted time frames or at all. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum_
_includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve_
_risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Prioritize investments in high-value, granular niche products in our core markets whilst_**
**_creating opportunities for platform servicing revenue._**

We intend to continue to deploy capital in a manner similar to the investments that have

given rise to our track record. Over the last 15 years, we have developed a leading data analytics
capability with over 1,000 deals underwritten, over 10 million customer accounts created over
10,000 of underlying properties across multiple geographies. This has helped us develop an
expertise in forecasting cash flows that has consistently driven superior pricing and low volatility


-----

and delivered our strong track record. Our local operating teams have relevant experience and
expertise in both the local markets and asset classes in which we operate.

We continue to seek off-market investment opportunities, utilizing our strong origination

capabilities, deep relationships and in-depth local knowledge. We believe targeting such
opportunities maximizes the risk / reward through smaller transactions in more sophisticated
granular asset classes and creates a competitive advantage. The continuation of this investment
strategy, we believe, will benefit our Balance Sheet business and will continue to present a
compelling investment case for potential LP investors, allowing further fund raising into
subsequent funds, as well as creating asset management and servicing opportunities for our
platforms.

**_Industry-leading asset management and servicing expertise which supports our investment_**
**_ambitions, clients and customers._**

We will continue to develop our asset management and servicing platforms, through our

technology and our people, to deliver high quality service to our clients, fair outcomes to our
customers and strong collections performance.

We undertake a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection

activity, real estate asset realization and litigation and court process management, master servicing
activities, such as legal title holding, securitization vehicle management activities and other
activities such as due diligence, on-boarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection
and servicing to many of the large institutional global and European debt funds. Our combination
of market-leading positions, niche dominant platforms and competitive specialist servicing and
investment platforms across five markets position us as a local operator with expertise in real
estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing.

We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure to ensure that it meets our objectives of

flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic presented, in real
time and on a scale and timescale that could not have been forecast, the opportunity to test our
resilience to maintain service levels for our customers and our clients. Our continued development
will support growth in our external and internal asset management and servicing activity and, with
increased scale with the opportunities presented by the Fund and Investment Management
business, our ability to drive operational leverage.

**_Create a simple, efficient and flexible organization by deploying agile practices, supported by_**
**_strong leadership and a commitment to develop our people to reach their full potential._**

Through our governance, organizational structure and technology, we seek to create an

efficient organization that can adapt to change and remain agile to ensure that we can capitalize on
market opportunities. Our leaders and personnel are the core of our organization and with flexible
working structures, training and development, we aim to ensure that our people maximize their
potential.

The establishment of the Fund Manager and our integrated fund manager model, which we

believe is unique in the market, demonstrates the ability of our business to adapt and deliver
change. The agility of the organization was fully demonstrated as the transition partly occurred


-----

during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated challenges that resulted from lockdowns and
other restrictions.

**_Allocate capital dynamically to drive returns while effectively managing risk._**

We operate across multi-asset classes and multiple geographies. As such, we seek to

allocate capital, through our investments in portfolios, depending on the prevailing market and
economic environment, in order to maximize the risk-adjusted returns within overall risk appetite
and concentration limits.

Our capital deployment for both our Balance Sheet business and the Fund has been strong

through 2021. However, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we have
remained cautious in our approach to pricing and underwriting investment opportunities.
Deployment has focused more on off-market real estate and special situation investments with
shorter weighted average life, rather than unsecured investments that tend to have a longer
weighted average life. This approach to capital deployment allows us to achieve target returns
whilst seeking to minimize the risk profile of our investments.

**_Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) focus driving better operational outcomes._**

We remain fully committed to meeting our stakeholders’ expectations of being a

responsible corporate citizen and addressing key sustainability issues. Our focus on ESG is firmly
embedded in our purpose and culture and we believe this focus will drive better operational
outcomes. We recognize the importance of ESG for our stakeholders. The holders of the Notes,
our shareholders and LP investors recognize the importance and value of investing in responsible
businesses delivering sustainable returns. Our regulators require assurance over our policies,
processes and practices and will act against firms that are non-compliant. Our customers expect to
receive fair outcomes, whilst portfolio sellers and third-party asset management clients often
require assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly and therefore, acting responsibly
is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage. Also, our people want to work for a good
corporate citizen.

The primary focus of the social leg of our ESG strategy is ensuring fair customer treatment,

which was particularly relevant throughout the COVID-19 pandemic where forbearance and
vulnerable customer policies were critical in our support of our customers. Furthermore, we
significantly curtailed litigation during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we believe that acting
responsibly delivers better long term returns for all our stakeholders. In particular, our customer
satisfaction levels rose during 2020, throughout such a difficult period for many of our customers.

We expect to vertically re-align our governance by empowering our local champion platforms with
local accountability under a fund manager framework. This framework will, we believe, deliver
greater accountability and improve performance. Furthermore, we aim to maintain our
commitment to diversity and inclusion among our people, in order to build a human-centric
workplace and provide a positive work environment, supporting a diversity of working styles and
appealing to a wider talent pool whilst retaining talented people who want autonomy and choice.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated our support for our people to help keep
them safe with 100% of our staff fully operational and working from home by the end of March


-----

2020. Lastly, the environmental leg of our ESG strategy involves our focus on the evolution and
development of our internal policies and due diligence standards, coupled with our ambition of
net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. See “Business—ESG.”

We caution that the below information should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or

representation by us or any other person regarding our expected financial performance and results
of operations. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete
discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of
operations.

The discussion below incorporates data for the nine month period ended September 30,

2021 that are derived from preliminary results and estimates contained in our management
accounts, which have not been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and are subject to change. The data for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2021 presented below is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our
financial or operational results for such period or as of such date, nor is it intended to give an
indication regarding the expected results for the year ending December 31, 2021 and it is based on
a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. The discussion below
also incorporates data that is derived from management’s projections. By their nature, projections
are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future, and are based on a number
of assumptions that are themselves subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should
not place reliance on this data when making an investment decision. In addition to the inherent
risks and uncertainties associated with using data derived from management accounts and
projections, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened and unprecedented
risks and uncertainties and has resulted in atypical, non-routine transactions and activities which
increase the likelihood that the data presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be in line
with the financial data we report in our year-end financial information. The unaudited financial

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan,

China, rapidly spreading to nearly all regions around the world, including the UK and Ireland, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Italy, which caused the World Health Organization to declare COVID

-----

19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, governments around
the world implemented several measures, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandatory
quarantines and self-isolations for infected people, business slowdowns or shutdowns, and
encouraging or requiring people to avoid large gatherings. For example, in response to the COVID19 pandemic, on March 23, 2020, the UK government imposed a nationwide quarantine together
with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures across all the countries in
which we operate, we closed substantially all of our offices and transitioned all of our employees
to remote working. Whilst restrictions have eased at times – for example the nationwide quarantine
in the UK was lifted on May 10, 2020 – significant restrictions and social distancing measures
have remained in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall economies of the countries
in which we operate and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. For instance, court
closures and various legal and regulatory measures intended to help debtors, such as moratoria on
certain collection or enforcement activities, along with a slowdown in the real estate market,
heavily impacted our ability to make collections during this period. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally
in 2020 by the temporary closure and restrictions as a consequence of the guidelines given by the
respective governments of the countries where we operate.

Collections performance is a critical factor for our business and the COVID-19 pandemic

led to disruptions in our cash collection performance, as a result of a deterioration in the
macroeconomic environment, changes to our customers’ financial circumstances and lockdown
measures implemented in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and
impacting the business’s ability to litigate and operate as normal. Our cash collections during the
three months ended March 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC with the only
material shortfall relating to £10 million of delayed collections from two large secured assets in
Italy and Ireland. However, we started to see the early signs of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic during March 2020 and our collections performance weakened in April 2020 with
secured collections, impacted by lockdown and court closures to 78% of ERC, enhanced by the
acceleration of cash flows from the restructuring of one of the Group’s co-investment portfolios.
During this period, unsecured collections stabilized at 74% of ERC. Excluding the collection
acceleration, cash collections for April 2020 settled at 75% of ERC.

Approximately 34% of the Group’s ERC is derived from secured portfolios – primarily in

Portugal and Italy – where cash collections are often driven either by the local court system or
result from the completion of real estate sales. Whilst both of these collection strategies were
directly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by European governments, secured
portfolios are backed by underlying assets and therefore, the timing of cash collections can be
impacted, together with the quantum in the event of real estate price decreases. The majority of
the remaining 66% of the Group’s ERC consists of unsecured assets – primarily in the UK,
followed by Portugal and the Netherlands – where collections are driven by smaller, more frequent
monthly cash collections. Automated collections form approximately 46% of total Group
collections and approximately 87% of Northern European (the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands)
unsecured collections. Where unsecured collections are not automated, they are substantially all
paid by remote electronic means.

Collections started to recover in May 2020 from the low in April, with secured collections

at 62% of ERC and unsecured at 85% of ERC. Collections during the three months ended March


-----

31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC, and during the six months ended June 30,
2020 were £175.7 million, representing 91% of ERC. Our financial response to the collections
weakness was proactive and we strengthened our liquidity position in the first half of 2020
demonstrating our ability to manage liquidity, in particular through the curtailment of investments
in new portfolio acquisitions and the suspension of shareholder dividends. Cash and cash
equivalents improved by £77.0 million to £165.8 million from December 31, 2019 to June 30,
2020 with decisive action on cost and working capital as well as acceleration of collections to
make up for COVID-19 induced collection weakness and reduced portfolio purchases of £42.9
million (six months ended June 30, 2019: £165.6 million). Furthermore, we raised additional funds
in July 2020 through the execution of a €104.7 million asset backed amortizing loan and completed
a long-term support agreement with our bank lenders at that time, recognizing that short term
leverage would increase above previous covenant levels as the impact of lower collections built
over the following twelve months. As a result of our cautious view on the macroeconomic
environment at that time, we reforecast our ERC at June 30, 2020, resulting in a non-cash write
down to portfolio investments on the balance sheet of £133.6 million and an operating loss of
£108.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (six months ended June 30, 2019: £59.0
million of operating profit).

During the third quarter of 2020, we saw an improving cash collections trend. Whilst the

easing of lockdown measures and the development of a vaccine have potentially lessened the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, we remained cautious.
Collections in the third quarter 2020 were £85.1 million representing 141% of the revised ERC,
and were partially driven by a catch-up in secured collections from earlier in the year. The
collections performance continued to be better than we predicted, with £78.1 million of collections
in the fourth quarter of 2020. Collections for the full year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to
£338.9 million (2019: £442.3 million), with collections during the six months ended December 31,
2020 representing 125% of revised ERC. Collections performance has continued to remain robust
in 2021, with collections in the first quarter of 2021 of £76.9 million (first quarter of 2020: £85.0
million) representing 106% of ERC and in the second quarter of 2021 of £102.7 million (second
quarter of 2020: £90.7 million) representing 131% of ERC. Collections during the six months
ended June 30, 2021 were £179.6 million, representing 119% of December 2020 ERC. Overall,
we have had a strong second quarter with our 2021 second quarter stand-alone results, with our
profit before tax being 1.9 times greater than our first quarter in 2021. For the six months ended
June 30, 2021, we had a profit before tax and takeover costs of £22.9 million (loss of £135.9
million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), with £22.4 million of Acquisition costs
recognized and, together with the strong collections performance, this had a beneficial impact on
our leverage levels with our leverage for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 decreasing by
0.4 times from 5.1 times.

While the impact to our business has been significant, the wider dislocation caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers has also been significant. Following the global
financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2
trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests
on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges. Whilst we
have not yet experienced an increase in the willingness of Investment Portfolio Sellers to sell


-----

defaulted debt, we expect that during late 2021 and into 2022, market activity will increase,
potentially leading to an increase in the volume of portfolios that we are able to acquire.

**Current Trading**

Our performance continued to remain stable during the three months ended September 30,

2021 with continued momentum around collections, deployment and contract wins within our
Asset Management and Servicing business. Balance Sheet Cash Collections outperformed ERC,
with Balance Sheet Cash Collections of £77.4 million representing 115% and 111% of ERC during
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

Furthermore, we continued to acquire investment portfolios, with €148.5 million deployed

by the Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Fund was 64% deployed or
committed (gross before capital recycling and including both third-party and balance sheet coinvestment) and up-front 54% as at June 30, 2021. We expect to start fundraising for ACO 2 in
early 2022 when the capital deployed, after recycling collections, within ACO 1 is approximately
70% of the total capital commitments (provided that the deployment rate remains consistent with
historical rates of deployment). See “Risk Factors—Relating to the Transactions—This Offering
_Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts_
_that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

Our Balance Sheet business invested £22.2 million during the three months ended

September 30, 2021 and our Asset Management and Servicing business continued to see strong
appetite for its services and won a further ten contracts during the three months ended September
30, 2021.

Leverage as at September 30, 2021 was 4.8 times, consistent with our leverage of 4.7 times

as of June 30, 2021 due primarily to the improvement in collections performance following the
easing of lock-down restrictions and court closures during the third quarter of 2020, which is not
included in the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. We are
committed to reducing leverage to 4.0 times by the end of 2021 (before incurring the Acquisition
costs). See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors relating to the Transactions—This Offering _Memorandum_
_includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve_
_risks and uncertainties.”_

in any activities other than those related to its formation and the Transactions.

**Principal Shareholder**

The Issuer is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Parent, which is indirectly controlled

by funds managed or advised by TDR Capital.

TDR Capital is a leading private equity firm with over €10 billion of assets under

management as of August 31, 2021 and is based in the UK. TDR Capital has an experienced team
of investment professionals and operating partners and has a low-volume investment strategy
based on principles developed by the investment team over the past decade. TDR Capital seeks to


-----

spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on operational excellence through a
tested and integrated operating partner model.

Intense pre-investment analysis and post-investment involvement mean that TDR Capital

is selective, typically making only one to three investments a year. TDR Capital takes an active
role in overseeing the operations of its investments, working in partnership with management
through board representation and professional support.

To date, TDR Capital has completed multiple investments across the funds, business and

financial services sectors. Some examples of current and prior TDR Capital investments include
TDR’s successful investments in Lowell Group, LeasePlan and Phoenix Group. TDR Capital
helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of unsecured debt, as its owner from
2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of the value drivers and regulation
relevant to the industry. TDR Capital’s experienced team of investment professionals and
operating partners has had a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business
services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet
management and driver mobility company.

In connection with the Transactions, TDR Capital has injected £513 million indirectly in

the form of equity into the Parent as part of the Equity Contribution.

**Corporate and Financing Structure**

The following chart depicts the corporate and financing structure of the Group in summary

form after giving effect to the Offering and the use of net proceeds thereof. For a summary of debt
obligations identified in this diagram, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description
_of the Notes.”_

(1) The Notes will be issued under the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes.” On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed jointly
and severally on a senior basis by the Parent, Finco and Bidco. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any
case no later than 120 days after the Re-Registration Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and
severally, by the Target and certain material wholly owned subsidiaries of the Target. The Guarantors will also guarantee on a senior basis
the Revolving Facility and certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities, if any.

(2) From the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain other conditions,
the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by certain security granted in favor of the Security Agent, including (i) a limited recourse English
law share charge over all shares held by Midco in the Parent and security assignment of intercompany loans owed by the Parent to Midco and
(ii) an English law debenture granted by each of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer granting fixed and floating security over substantially
all of the assets of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer, as further described in “Description of the Notes—Security.” As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any case no later than 120 days after the Re-Registration Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Notes and the Guarantees will also be secured by certain security granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors in favor of the
Security Agent, including (1) an English law debenture over certain material assets of the Additional Guarantors that are incorporated in
England and Wales, (2) comparable security for Additional Guarantors incorporated in Guernsey and Jersey, and (3) with respect to the
Additional Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands, security over (i) the material bank accounts of such Additional Guarantors, (ii) intraRestricted Group receivables, and (iii) shares owned by such Additional Guarantors in the Issuer or the other Guarantors. Pursuant to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations and certain operating facilities that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon
any enforcement action over the Collateral. The Collateral may be released in circumstances described in “Description of the Notes—Security.”


-----

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under
the Revolving Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities have been repaid in full.
See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral may also secure additional debt in the future. As of the Issue Date, upon repayment
of certain borrowings under the Revolving Facility, £55 million is expected to remain outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

(3) The Group, comprising of the Parent and its subsidiaries, including the Issuer and the Target Group, are controlled by TDR Capital. TDR
Capital indirectly holds 90.72% beneficial ownership and voting rights in the Parent and the Stub Equity Holders own 9.28% of the beneficial
ownership and voting rights in the Parent. On October 11, 2021, Bidco, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, completed the
Acquisition by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. On or about October 15,
2021, investment funds managed or advised by TDR Capital, indirectly through Midco, by way of the Equity Contribution, provided an
aggregate amount of £513 million to the Parent. Further, pursuant to the Alternative Offer, the 9.28% Stub Equity Holders of the Target also
indirectly contributed £52 million of the equity of Bidco through their investment in Topco.

(4) The Target Group has two non-recourse committed asset-backed securitization term loans, being the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility and the
Euro Non-Recourse Facility. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding amount under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility was £54.7 million and
the outstanding amount under the Euro Non-Recourse Facility was €48.0 million. Further, certain entities in the Target Group are borrowers
under the Miscellaneous Facilities. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding amounts under the Miscellaneous Facilities were £3.1 million. The
indebtedness incurred under the Non-Recourse Facilities and the Miscellaneous Facilities will remain outstanding on the Issue Date.

(5) Not all of the subsidiaries of the Parent will guarantee the Notes and the Revolving Facility. As of June 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to
the Transactions, the subsidiaries of the Parent that are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had £101.5 million (equivalent) of
third party debt outstanding consisting of amounts drawn under the Non-Recourse Sterling Facility, the Non-Recourse Euro Facility, the
Miscellaneous Facilities and other borrowings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes
_will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs.”_

(6) Pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer will provide the Proceeds Loan to Finco on or about the Issue Date and Finco will use
the proceeds from the Proceeds Loan to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility, (a) certain of which was onlent to Bidco and was used by Bidco to finance the transaction costs in connection with the Transactions (other than the Offering of the Notes)
and (b) certain of which was on-lent to the Target Group to repay and cancel the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility.

(7) On the Issue Date, AGG Capital Management (Holdco) Limited (“ACMH”), AGG Capital Management Limited (“ACML” or the “Fund
**Manager”), which is ACMH’s direct Subsidiary and our main fund management entity, and ACML’s Subsidiaries that are general partners**
of the various funds managed by ACML will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore will not be subject to any restrictions under the
Indenture. ACML is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ACMH and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Target. ACML has issued
preferred ordinary shares to Arrow Global Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Target and an Additional Guarantor. Pursuant to its holding
of the preferred ordinary shares, Arrow Global Limited, an entity within the Restricted Group, receives 100% of the dividends declared by
ACML and is entitled to full voting control in respect of the preferred ordinary shares held by it. For further details, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Business Model: Our Structure.” Also see “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the_
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs.”_

(8) The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Parent, Midco and Bidco (together, the “Initial Guarantors”),
and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than 120 days after the Re-Registration Date, by the Target, Arrow Global
One Limited, Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited, Arrow Global Investments Holdings Limited, Arrow Global (Holdings) Limited,
Arrow Global Limited, Quest Topco Limited, Quest Bidco Limited, Quest Newco Limited, CapQuest Group Limited, Capquest Investments
Limited, Arrow Global Investments Holdings Benelux B.V., Fiditon Holding B.V., Incassobureau Fiditon B.V., Arrow SMA LP Limited,
Arrow SMA GP I Limited, Arrow Global SMA I LP, AGHL Portugal Investment Holdings, S.A. and Whitestar Asset Solutions, S.A.;
(together, the “Additional Guarantors”). See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” The Guarantors are also guarantors under the
Revolving Facility. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors contributed 95% of the Target Group’s
Adjusted EBITDA and accounted for 86% of the Target Group’s investment portfolio assets.

**Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons**


Prior to        , 2023, the Issuer may also redeem during
each 12-month period commencing with the Issue Date up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Sterling Notes
outstanding, at its option, from time to time, at a redemption

In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the

series at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.
See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons.”_


**Additional Amounts** Any payments made by the Issuer, the Successor Company (as
defined herein) or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes will
be made without withholding or deduction for or on account
of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer, the Successor
Company or the Guarantors are required by law to withhold or
deduct amounts for or on account of tax imposed by the UK
(or certain other relevant taxing jurisdictions) with respect to
a payment to the holders of the Notes, the Issuer, the Successor
Company or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the
net amount received by the holders of the Notes after the
withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they
would have received in the absence of the withholding or
deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.”_

**Further Issuance of Notes** Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer will be
permitted to issue additional Notes. Additional Notes shall be
treated, along with all other notes issued under the Indenture,
as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect
to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not
specifically distinguished for such series. For all purposes
other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, additional Notes
shall be deemed to form one series with any notes previously
issued under the Indenture if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such other notes.

In the event that any additional Notes issued after the date
hereof and sold pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with


-----

any notes previously issued under such Indenture for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional
Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable,
so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued
notes under such Indenture. Additional Notes sold pursuant to
Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same
ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification
number as the applicable series of notes previously issued
under such Indenture without being fungible with such series
of notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain_ _U.S._ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_

_Considerations”) considering the purchase of Notes sold_
pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in
the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors
concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax

consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the
potential issuance of additional Notes that are not fungible
with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the
Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which
nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified. In
the event additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S
that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other
securities identification number as Notes belonging to the
same series previously issued, without being fungible with
such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes that form part of that series, including in respect of
investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such
additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to BookEntry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any)
representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could
adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes—Additional Notes sold pursuant to_
_Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S._
_federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and_
_Form—Transfers” and “Description of the Notes—Additional_
_Notes.”_

**Change of Control** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the
Issuer may be required to offer to redeem the Notes at 101%


-----

of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any. However, a change
of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a certain
consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with
such an event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.”_

**Certain Covenants** The Indenture relating to the Notes, among other things,
restricts the ability of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries
to:

                 - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                 - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase

or redeem our stock;

                 - make investments or other restricted payments;

                 - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                 - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted

subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

                 - transfer or sell assets;

                 - engage in transactions with affiliates;

                 - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

                 - impair security interests; and

                 - merge or consolidate with or into another company.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions** We have not registered the Notes or the Guarantees under the
Securities Act. We have not agreed to, or otherwise
undertaken, to register the Notes under the Securities Act. You
may only offer or sell the Notes in transactions that are exempt
from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, or pursuant to an effective registration
statement. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**No prior market** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently
no established trading market. Although certain of the Initial
Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market
in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may
discontinue market-making at any time without notice.


-----

Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active trading
market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds** We expect to use the proceeds from the Offering (i) to
provide the Proceeds Loan to Finco on or about the Issue
Date and (ii) to pay certain fees and expenses associated with
the Offering. Finco will use the proceeds from the Proceeds
Loan (i) to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under
the Revolving Facility, (a) certain of which were on-lent to
Bidco and will be used by Bidco to finance a portion of the
costs in connection with the Transactions (other than the
Offering) and (b) certain of which were on-lent to the Target
Group to repay and cancel the Arrow Global Revolving
Credit Facility and (ii) to provide the Target Loans to the

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER**

**INFORMATION**

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information**

The following tables summarize the Target Group’s historical consolidated financial

information as of the dates and for the periods indicated, which has been derived from the 2018
Consolidated Financial Statements, 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements, 2020 Consolidated
Financial Statements and the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, and the related notes,
in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We have also presented certain
information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, in order to facilitate a comparison of the
Target Group’s results of operations for such periods with other periods presented. The
information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, has been derived by subtracting the Target
Group’s six months ended June 30, 2020, results of operations data from the Target Group’s results
of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2020, and adding the Target Group’s results
of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The Target Group’s results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of

the results to be expected for any future period. For further information on the basis of presentation
of the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information.” Certain of the Target Group’s subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of_
the Issue Date, but will be consolidated in the Parent’s consolidated financial statements for future
periods. However, these Unrestricted Subsidiaries will remain outside of the Restricted Group.

Further, the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been re-presented in the

2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-presentation relates to certain balance
sheet items, including (i) the inclusion of £26.6 million of bank balances within cash and cash
equivalents, that were previously shown within trade and other receivables (this cash balance may
be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated
securitization structure awaiting a payment date); and (ii) the reclassification of £21.7 million from
‘other operating expenses’ to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ as part of the change
in the segmental reporting structure as a result of the Target Group now being managed through
an integrated asset management model. The total impact on operating expenses as a result of the
reclassification is nil. For further information on the re-presentation of the 2019 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations.” and_
“Summary—Summary Consolidated Historical Financial and Other Information.”

We present below certain non-IFRS measures and ratios that are not required by or

presented in accordance with IFRS, including Adjusted EBITDA, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and certain leverage and coverage ratios, among others.
There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as exceptional will not
recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The non-IFRS measures
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as
alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of
performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS measures as presented in this
Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures


-----

used by other companies, and Adjusted EBITDA, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Annualized Adjusted EBITDA may each differ from consolidated EBITDA contained in
“Description of the Notes” and that will be contained in the Indenture. The calculations for the
non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions. This information is inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition
or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

The following financial information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated

Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and with “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations.”_

On the Issue Date, ACMH, ACML and ACML’s subsidiaries will be Unrestricted

Subsidiaries and therefore not subject to the restrictions under the Indenture. No separate financial
information for ACMH and its subsidiaries is included in this Offering Memorandum and the
results of these Unrestricted Subsidiaries are consolidated in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

(8) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the year adjusted to exclude the effects of finance income and costs, taxation credit/(charge)
on ordinary activities, portfolio amortization, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains/(losses), amortization of acquisition and
bank facility fees, gain on disposal of leases, profit/(loss) on disposal of intangible assets, share-based payments and deferred consideration
renegotiations.

**_Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash flow. For supplemental purposes, we have also included a reconciliation of net cash used in_**
operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of this reconciliation, Adjusted EBITDA represents net cash used in operating
activities adjusted to exclude the effects of purchases of portfolio investments, income taxes paid, working capital adjustments, amortization
of acquisition and bank facility fees, write off and disposal of intangible asset and property plant and equipment and other adjusting items.

**_Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Balance Sheet Cash Collections._** Additionally, for supplemental purposes, we have included a
reconciliation of Balance Sheet Cash Collections, which is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements that are presented in accordance
with IFRS, to Adjusted EBITDA. We include this supplemental reconciliation because we consider the conversion of Balance Sheet Cash
Collections to Adjusted EBITDA to be a key driver of our performance and key to understanding our liquidity. For purposes of this
reconciliation, Adjusted EBITDA represents Balance Sheet Cash Collections (which includes income from portfolio investments (including
fair value and impairment losses and gains) and portfolio amortization), and excluding the effects of other income (which is income from
Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment Management), operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, foreign
exchange (gains)/losses, amortization of acquisition and bank facility fees, deferred consideration renegotiations, loss on disposal of intangible
asset, share-based payments and other adjusting items.

The following tables set forth the reconciliations of profit for the period, net cash flow from operating activities, and income from portfolio
investments, in each case, to Adjusted EBITDA (and in the case of net cash flow from operating activities, to Adjusted Free Cash Flow) for
the periods indicated.

(a) Financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been re-presented in the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. Cash and cash equivalents for 2020 included £12,902,000 (2019: £26,611,000) of cash which may be subject to constraints
regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date. The 2019
reconciliation above has been re-presented to remove these amounts from the net cash generated by operating activities, as in the prior
year they were included within this line item, but are now included within cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of each
year.

(b) Portfolio amortization represents Balance Sheet Cash Collections in excess of income from purchased portfolio investments.

(c) Foreign exchange losses/(gains) include costs related to the re-translation of euro-denominated loan portfolios.

(d) Adjusting items relate to exceptional or non-cash costs.

(e) Working capital adjustments included, historically, the net movement on debtors and creditors, excluding the Arrow Global Revolving
Credit Facility, Non-Recourse Facilities, the 2024 Notes and related accrued interest, the 2025 Notes and related accrued interest and
the 2026 Notes and related accrued interest, and corporation tax debtors and creditors. The following table sets forth the working capital
adjustments based on the Target Group’s consolidated statement of cash flow for the periods under review.

_segmental profit before tax, EBITDA and EBITDA Margin” for our business segment EBITDA split. The Capital-light businesses’ percentage_
of Group EBITDA for the six months and for the twelve months both ended June 30, 2021 does not take into account any costs associated
with the Acquisition.

(10) Leverage is calculated as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. We

present Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that this non-IFRS measure
provides useful information regarding a company’s ability to service and incur indebtedness,
particularly in light of COVID-19 pandemic-related effects on our audited historical data. The Pro
Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA information presented below has been prepared for
information purposes only in order to estimate our operating results had we not been impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic by annualizing our results in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
also by making certain adjustments to reflect certain anticipated cost savings in connection with
the Acquisition. While we believe that we will implement processes in place to achieve such cost
savings, we may not be able to achieve them in full or within the contemplated timelines. See “Risk
_Factors—Relating to the Transactions—Bidco has made certain assumptions relating to the_
_Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate,” “Risk Factors—Relating to_
_the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain_
_targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Relating to the Transactions—We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain_
_unaudited adjusted data, and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS.”_
Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S.
GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in
accordance with any applicable auditing standards. As a non-IFRS measures, Pro Forma
Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is not identified as an accounting measure under IFRS and
therefore should not be considered as an alternative or substitute measure to evaluate our
performance. Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and
should not be considered in isolation. You should also bear in mind the limitations inherent in the
use of annualized data, including that our first half of 2021 is not necessarily representative of our
entire year. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Other Financial Information—Financial
_measures not prepared in accordance with IFRS” for further details._

Further, Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering

Memorandum is for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of our historical
operating results nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. The assumptions
underlying the adjustments are based on our estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from
anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Forward

_Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Relating to the Transactions—This Offering_
_Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts_
_that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the six months

ended June 30, 2021 to Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA.

(1) For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash flow and to Balance Sheet Cash collections, see note (8) under “—Other Financial
_Information” above._

(2) Our segmental revenues from the Asset Management and Servicing business for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £64.2 million
(including internal revenues). However, these revenues do not give effect to (i) the expected full run-rate effect of contract wins made prior
to June 30, 2021, including the contract with Tesco Bank that was concluded in the third quarter of 2021, and (ii) the increase in revenues
from management fees generated by our ACO 1 fund for investments which have already been committed, but for which fees have not been
accrued fully during this period. We expect that our revenues from the Asset Management and Servicing business would increase to
approximately £75 million based on (a) budgeted revenue from 26 new contract wins in 2020 and budgeted revenue from a further 11 new
contract wins during the first half of 2021, as well as the contract with Tesco Bank that was concluded in the third quarter of 2021, less
revenues derived from contracts due to expire during that period, and (b) run-rate for asset management and servicing fees based on the
deployment of the Fund during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and being serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business.
We have derived an estimated run-rate effect of these budgeted revenues by assuming a 45% EBITDA Margin to the expected revenue
increase of approximately £11 million. We believe that the assumption of 45% EBITDA Margin is reasonable based on our experience with
similar contracts.

(3) Run-rate effect of revenues from our Fund and Investment Management business represent the incremental management fees of approximately
£2 million generated from the deployment by the Fund during the six-month period ended June 30, 2021. The run-rate effect has been
calculated by multiplying the net asset value, excluding any working capital borrowings within the Fund, by the average management fees
generated, and subtracting that from the actual management fees for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

(4) We have provided an Annualized Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA figure which is derived by multiplying our Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the
six months ended June 30, 2021 by two.

(5) Management is targeting £20 million of cost savings comprising three elements, being (i) target annual estimated cost savings of £6 million
on account of conversion of AGG from a public listed company to a private company (the savings are expected to be delivered as a result of
the Acquisition and will include reduced board management costs, reduction due to the removal of the existing long term incentive plan and
share incentive plan schemes, lower advisor costs, reduced investor relations activity and sundry savings), (ii) £6 million of estimated savings
expected to be realized at or shortly after the completion of the strategic review and are expected to be delivered through organizational
changes and reduced central functions overhead costs, such as cost savings expected from the planned vertical alignment of our local platforms
and the corresponding local investment strategies under a fund management framework and our focus on creating a cost-ownership culture
which engenders accountability and delivers efficiencies without creating dual-layer costs (see “Business—Cost Structure Development and
_Cost Saving Opportunities—Cost Savings” for further information), and (iii) £8 million of estimated targeted savings, which will be targeted_
to be delivered following the completion of the strategic review during the course of 2022. The savings are expected to be realized through
greater efficiency, increased accountability and operational leverage within the platforms, such as the implementation of collection cost
reduction initiatives. The total targeted cost savings of £20 million of net run-rate annual cost savings represent 8.9% of our overall cost base
based on a cost base of £225 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, an independent third-party advisor estimates total
cost savings of between £17 and £32 million, with £9 to £20 million overhead cost reductions and £8 to £13 million in direct cost reductions.
This compares with the management’s target savings of £20 million as outlined above. The independent third-party advisor also estimates
one-off costs ranging from £10 million to £20 million in order to realize such cost savings. See also “Business—Cost Structure Development
_and Cost Saving Opportunities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking_
_statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Transactions—We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, and other financial information not prepared_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider_

_the following risks, together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum,_
_in deciding whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below_
_could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If these_
_events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all or_
_part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment._
_Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial could also adversely_
_affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations_
_under the Notes, and affect your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_

_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-_
_looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Business**

**Our UK operations are subject to significant oversight by UK regulators that view our**
**operations as “higher risk” activities. Failure to comply with such applicable laws,**
**regulations and codes of practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management**
**industries in the UK could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or**
**impairment of our ability to conduct business.**

As of June 30, 2021, 36% (by 84-Month ERC) of the portfolios that we have purchased

were originated in the UK, where our operations are subject to licensing and regulation by
governmental and regulatory bodies, including the FCA, the ICO and the UK Office of
Communications. The FCA regards debt collection as a “higher-risk” activity, which is subject to
detailed conduct of business rules and, generally, more stringent regulatory standards than “lowerrisk” activities. In addition, the FCA has substantial enforcement powers and a broad range of
disciplinary measures that it can apply. To date, the FCA has already taken action against a number
of operators in the consumer credit and mortgage servicing industries including various debt
management firms. The FCA may take further action against our industry as a whole that may
require significant modifications to how we operate our business, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition.

Our business in the UK is conducted through the UK Regulated Firms, which are Group

companies that are authorized and regulated by the FCA to conduct consumer credit and mortgagerelated regulated activities. See “Regulation and ComplianceRegulatory FrameworkUnited
_Kingdom.”_

To maintain full authorization to carry on regulated activities, the UK Regulated Firms are

required to continually meet certain organizational and suitability standards (referred to as the
“threshold conditions”), including that they are “fit and proper” to maintain their authorization.
The FCA is required by FSMA to determine whether a firm that is authorized by the FCA continues
to meet the threshold conditions. Failure to continually meet the threshold conditions may result


-----

in the FCA taking disciplinary action, including commencing a process to vary, suspend or
withdraw a firm’s authorization. Where an authorized firm breaches FCA rules, the FCA may take
enforcement action which might lead it to, for example, impose a financial penalty on that firm or
issue a public statement of censure.

Since our receipt of FCA authorization in August 2016, we have had an open and

transparent relationship with the FCA, including the fact that we have made a number of
notifications to the FCA in compliance with its Principles of Business Rules. Following such
notifications, the FCA has sought information on a number of our activities, including, but not
limited to, refunds for customers where their accounts have a credit balance due to over-payments
or account adjustments, the remediation of customer accounts to meet requirements of the CCA,
the application of post-judgment interest to customer accounts by DCAs and collection of statute
barred debt.

If any of the UK Regulated Firms’ authorization is varied, suspended or withdrawn, our

business would be severely constrained and could not continue to be operated in the way it is
currently being operated. In addition, any variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or
certain other disciplinary action taken by the FCA against one of the UK Regulated Firms, may
become publicly known and may result in severe reputational damage. If any of the UK Regulated
Firms becomes subject to disciplinary action by the FCA, Investment Portfolio Sellers that
currently do business with us may cease to do so, and our ability to purchase debt and our ability
to win future business may be materially adversely affected. Further, disciplinary action may
require us to make potentially significant changes to our business practices or expend significant
sums in fines, redress or remediation.

We might also have to introduce changes to our business practices in response to

disciplinary action taken against competitors or as a result of the FCA’s supervisory activities
(such as thematic reviews of the consumer credit and mortgage servicing markets). Remedial
actions that may be necessary could increase our costs, reduce our ability to collect from our
purchased portfolios, reduce our ability to invest and develop our Fund and Investment
Management business and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, our risk management and compliance framework may require
additional investment and resources to satisfy applicable FCA requirements and we may need to
enhance it further to comply with forthcoming and future legal and regulatory requirements.

In addition to certain FCA requirements, the UK Regulated Firms are also subject to

numerous detailed legislative and regulatory requirements, principally contained in FSMA, the
CCA, the UTCCR, the CRA and the CPUTR. The UK Regulated Firms are also subject to the
FCA Handbook which sets out rules and guidance, including PRIN, GEN, SYSC, CONC and
MCOB (as relevant). See “Regulation and Compliance—Regulatory Framework—United
_Kingdom.” We subscribe to the Standards of Lending Practice issued by the LSB, having become_
a registered firm with the LSB in July 2016.

Regardless of each company’s direct legal and regulatory position, the UK Regulated Firms

may be subject to contractual obligations to observe certain requirements under, or to ensure that
their business is run in a way that is not inconsistent with, certain additional FCA rules or
requirements. As a result of our registration with the LSB, we are required to comply with the


-----

relevant provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice by Investment Portfolio Sellers and,
therefore, we operate in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Standards of Lending
Practice.

Any failure by us or our agents or assignees to comply with applicable laws, regulations,

rules and guidance (such as the rules and guidance on irresponsible lending and debt collection,
fund and investment management), or material contractual obligations could result in regulatory
investigations or enforcement action (that may, for example, lead to fines, obligations to
implement remediation programs, the variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization for
some or all of the UK Regulated Firms), court sanctions (that may, for example, render customer
agreements, or certain contractual terms therein, unenforceable or require us to repay sums or pay
damages to borrowers or investors), FOS examinations (that may, for example, require us to pay
compensation) and reputational damage. Further, and as an example, non-compliance with certain
provisions of the CCA may render customer agreements unenforceable against the borrower and
result in there being no obligation on the borrower to pay interest and charges during the period of
non-compliance, and may also require interest and charges that have already been collected to be
refunded. As the UK Regulated Firms are dependent on information being provided to them by
Investment Portfolio Sellers to enable them to comply with certain obligations under the CCA, a
failure to obtain this information at the time of purchase or to ensure that there are suitable
contractual obligations on the Investment Portfolio Seller to provide this information could
adversely affect the UK Regulated Firms’ ability to comply with those obligations. In addition,
such failure to comply, variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or any actions by us
that may damage the reputation or increase the compliance risk of any Investment Portfolio Seller,
could entitle an Investment Portfolio Seller to terminate any Forward Flow Agreement with us and
to seek available remedies. In such a case, the Investment Portfolio Seller may be entitled to
repurchase portfolios that we previously purchased from it. Damage to our reputation, whether due
to a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules and guidance or material contractual
obligations, variation, suspension or withdrawal of authorization, or any other regulatory action,
could deter Investment Portfolio Sellers and investors from selling portfolios to us or investing
with us and/or result in our being removed from their sales panels. Moreover, failure by the UK
Regulated Firms or by Investment Portfolio Sellers to comply with consumer protection legislation
may lead to customer agreements becoming unenforceable (in part or in whole), which could
render the UK Regulated Firms unable to collect purchased debts and, depending on the breach,
may result in them losing the right to charge (or retain) interest and other fees or charges under
such agreements without taking appropriate remedial action (which could be costly and time
consuming) or at all.

**_We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in jurisdictions other than the UK in which_**
**_we operate and failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice_**
**_relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management industries in these jurisdictions_**
**_could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability_**
**_to conduct business._**

As of June 30, 2021, 64% (by 84-Month ERC) of the portfolios that we have purchased

were originated outside the UK. This percentage is expected to grow in the future with 57% (by
84-Month ERC) of our portfolios originated outside the UK, as of December 31, 2019. Through
acquisition of our servicing platforms and the investment in portfolios originated in jurisdictions


-----

outside the UK, we have expanded our geographical footprint and, as such, we are subject to a
variety of national laws and regulations, including in respect of data privacy, anti-money
laundering and terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, economic sanctions, unfair competition,
customer treatment and price fixing, in the jurisdictions that we operate, principally Portugal, Italy,
Ireland and the Netherlands . For example:

    - In Portugal, we are subject to oversight by the CMVM, with Hefesto being an

authorized and supervised entity. While our purchases of non-paying loan portfolios
from Portuguese credit institutions are generally not considered to constitute a
regulated activity, they, together with our engagement of local agencies, fall under the
general rules of the Portuguese Civil Code. In addition, we must comply with the
GDPR, and Law no. 41/2004 of August 18, which implements in Portugal the ePrivacy
Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC).

    - In the Netherlands, in order to act as an intermediary in respect of consumer credit

and/or mortgage credit and to offer consumer credit and/or mortgage credit (including
activities relating to the servicing of existing credit agreements granted by third
parties), we must have and maintain licenses granted by the AFM and the Vesting
Group entities that have such licenses must comply with ongoing requirements and
rules of conduct. In addition, to the extent we collect and process personal data as data
controllers, we must comply with statutory obligations under the GDPR.

    - In Italy, we operate through Zenith, which is a financial intermediary regulated and

supervised by the Bank of Italy, and Parr, now trading as Whitestar Italy. We also need
to comply with the Italian data protection legislation and the relevant Italian anti-money
laundering regulation, which both incorporate EU-wide legislative requirements.

    - In Ireland, through Mars Capital Ireland (acquired as part of the Mars acquisition), we

operate as a credit servicing firm and are regulated by the CBI. As a regulated credit
servicing firm, we are authorized to manage and administer credit agreements advanced
to borrowers, including mortgages secured on properties in Ireland and abroad. We are
required to comply with all applicable CBI codes of conduct and applicable data
protection regulations, including the GDPR and the Irish Data Protections Acts.

A failure by us, or our agents or assignees, to comply with the applicable legal, regulatory

and licensing requirements may, for example, result in the suspension, termination or impairment
of our ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction or other sanctions, including fines
and public censure.

As we expand potentially into new jurisdictions, our business will be subject to applicable

laws, regulations, rules and licensing requirements in those jurisdictions, which may be different,
or more onerous, than in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. Further, due to Brexit, we
may be subject to differing sets of rules and regulations in the UK and EU. Being subject to
differing regulatory compliance standards in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may
increase the costs of regulatory compliance and may lead to adverse outcomes for our business
should the demands of the different regulators conflict.

**_Following the establishment of our Fund and Investment Management business, our fund_**
**_managers, AGG Capital Management Limited, Norfin and Sagitta, are subject to various laws,_**
**_regulations and codes of practice applicable to the fund management industry. Failure to_**
**_comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice relating to this industry in_**
**_the applicable jurisdictions could result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or_**
**_impairment of our ability to conduct business._**

During 2019, we created our Fund and Investment Management business and established

AGG Capital Management Limited, a Jersey registered fund manager (“ACML” or the “Fund
**Manager”). ACML is the fund manager for our inaugural closed end fund, Arrow Credit**
Opportunities SCSP, SICAV-RAIF (the “Fund”) and certain separately managed accounts, with
total capital commitments of €1.7 billion (including our investment through a separately managed
account).

The Fund is an Alternative Investment Fund within the meaning of Directive 2011/61/EU

of June 8, 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the “AIFMD”). Waystone
Management Company (IE) Luxembourg Branch (formerly DMS) has been appointed to act as the
partnership’s Alternative Investment Fund Manager (the “AIFM”). The AIFM is ultimately
responsible for, inter alia, the risk management, valuation and portfolio management of the Fund,
but the AIFM has delegated portfolio management in respect of the Fund to the Fund Manager.
The AIFM is authorized and regulated as an alternative investment fund manager by the Central
Bank of Ireland under the European Communities (Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive) regulations 2013.

The Fund Manager is licensed by the JFSC to conduct fund services business pursuant to

the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (as amended, the “Jersey FS Law”) and is required to
comply with the applicable requirements of the Code of Practice for FSB. In order to support the
Fund Manager’s compliance with the Jersey FS Law and the fund services business codes of
practice promulgated thereunder, the Fund Manager is itself managed and administered by Saltgate
Limited, a Jersey regulated administrator, which is licensed to act as a Manager of a Managed
Entity (such administrator, the “MoME”).

European Depositary Bank S.A. (the “Depositary”) has been appointed depositary of the

Fund. The Depositary is responsible for the custody and the verification of ownership of any
financial instruments of the Fund that are required to be held in custody under the terms of the
establishment of the Fund and the Luxembourg Law of July 12, 2013 on Alternative Investment
Fund Managers implementing the AIFMD (the “Luxembourg 2013 Law”). The Depositary is
also responsible for cash monitoring, segregation of the assets and certain additional oversight
functions under the Luxembourg 2013 Law.

The other businesses within our Fund and Investment Management business are Europa

Investimenti, Sagitta and Norfin. Sagitta is a fund manager regulated and supervised by the Bank
of Italy. Norfin is a prominent real estate fund manager operating in Portugal and is regulated to
manage undertakings for collective investment in property by CMVM.

There is a risk that one or more entities within the Fund and Investment Management

business may not comply or adhere to the applicable laws, regulations and codes of practice


-----

relating to this industry in the applicable jurisdictions and this could result in substantial losses and
the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct business going forward.

**_We are subject to oversight by, and owe contractual obligations of compliance to, Investment_**
**_Portfolio Sellers._**

Investment Portfolio Sellers and third-party servicing clients typically require oversight

and details of our operations, and any additional legal and regulatory requirements that we must
take into account by virtue of our contractual obligations could become more stringent, which
could result in additional operational costs and may have an adverse effect on our operations. We
are subject to ongoing audits and due diligence reviews by Investment Portfolio Sellers and thirdparty servicing clients to determine our compliance under the relevant contractual obligations, and
to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our services and measures, compliance with applicable
laws and regulations and internal controls and management, among other things. More specifically,
audits undertaken by Investment Portfolio Sellers and third-party servicing clients tend to focus
on our governance, risk management framework, compliance arrangements, oversight of our
DCAs and our ongoing fair treatment of customers, including how we handle vulnerable
customers, complaints, litigation activity, call handling and our customers’ end-to-end journey
through different strategies. We are also subject, with increasing frequency, to information security
audits. Investment Portfolio Sellers and third-party servicing clients, in particular the UK retail
banks, have, in recent years, increased their requirements in terms of the scope of regulatory
requirements, regulatory and industry guidance (including voluntary codes of conduct) and best
market practice that they expect debt purchasers to comply with in order to be admitted to and/or
to be retained on their sales panel or undertake servicing on their behalf. Future reviews could lead
to being removed from certain sales panels, which could reduce our ability to purchase loan
portfolios, a failure to win or retain asset management and servicing contracts, and otherwise
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks by virtue of the requirements applicable to DCAs and other servicers._**

We currently allocate certain of our accounts and certain portfolios to third-party DCAs

and other servicers in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As of June 30, 2021, approximately
29% of investments made by the Fund were serviced by third-party servicers. To the extent these
third parties violate laws, other regulatory requirements or their contractual obligations to us, or
act inappropriately in the conduct of their business, our business and reputation could be negatively
affected or penalties could be directly imposed on us, as, in the UK in particular, the FCA expects
regulated businesses to comply with its rules and guidance on outsourcing, which means that
regulated businesses, such as the UK Regulated Firms, need to carefully select any third parties
with whom they work and, to a certain degree, take responsibility for any compliance violations
by such third parties. We may, for example, incur costs in reimbursing customers by reason of
violations by DCAs and other third parties that adversely affected such customers. Further, if any
such third-party carrying on regulated activities were unable to obtain any necessary regulatory
authorization at the relevant time, accounts may have to be recalled from that third-party, which
could interrupt customer payments and result in financial loss for us. See also “—We would be
_adversely affected if third parties, including DCAs, law firms and servicers performing servicing_
_and other collections activities on our, the Fund’s or future fund’s portfolios, perform poorly or_
_fail to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.”_


-----

**_We are subject to voluntary codes of conduct._**

We comply, and may have to comply with further industry guidance and voluntary codes

of conduct or practice, particularly as many Investment Portfolio Sellers and third-party servicing
clients expect us to comply with non-mandatory requirements that have come to be seen as
essential, rather than merely “good market practice.” The Standards of Lending Practice in the UK
(previously the Lending Code) is a prominent example of a voluntary code that has become
standard in practice. Failure to comply with such voluntary codes may harm our reputation and
our ability to compete in the debt purchase and fund investment and asset management markets,
among other things.

**_Changes to the regulatory environment in the future in the jurisdictions in which we operate or_**
**_an increasing volume of legislation may materially adversely affect the debt purchase and_**
**_collection and fund and asset management industries and impede our business and/or increase_**
**_our costs._**

The volume of legislation that is applicable to all of the consumer credit and consumer

mortgage servicing, fund and investment management and asset management sectors in the
jurisdictions in which we operate has increased in recent years, and this trend may continue or
further increase depending on the prevailing political and regulatory environment and attitudes
towards these sectors in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Increasingly, the political and
regulatory focus is on ensuring that businesses treat their customers fairly and that business
processes throughout the credit cycle are focused on achieving fair outcomes for consumers, from
assessing affordability of credit at the outset through to treating borrowers in financial difficulties
with forbearance. New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations (or the
manner in which they are interpreted or applied) could subject us to additional operating costs or
potentially expose us to additional liability, or otherwise adversely impact the manner in which we
operate our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

**Other legal and regulatory obligations. In the UK, for example, in addition to the CCA,**

FSMA, the UTCCR, the CRA and the CPUTR, there are a significant number of other
requirements to which we are already subject, or with which we comply voluntarily. Such
requirements may change or may be interpreted or applied differently in the future, and we may
become subject to new laws and regulations, such as those related to debt collection, the
enforceability of credit agreements, the statute of limitations for enforcement of debt obligations,
credit reporting, consumer bankruptcy, the management of consumer debt, fund and investment
management, asset management, accounting standards, taxation requirements, employment and
data privacy and protection.

**FCA agenda. The FCA set out a list of its key priorities in its annual Business Plan, and**

for 2021/22, the key priorities will be applicable to the consumer, wholesale and cross-sector
markets, respectively. Additionally, and specifically relating to cross-sector markets, the focus will
be on: financial resilience, operational resilience, fraud, Environmental, Social and Governance
(“ESG”) initiatives, improving diversity and inclusion and relationships with international
regulators and enabling a more sustainable financial future. There is a risk that this, or future,
regulatory development, may result in the tightening of UK regulation of, and new restrictions on,


-----

the consumer credit and consumer mortgage servicing markets generally, including in relation to
the debt purchase and collection business.

**Shorter statutes of limitation. The statute of limitations dictates the amount of time that**

a business has to commence legal proceedings to enforce payment obligations. Where a right of
action has accrued to recover a debt and the person liable or accountable for the claim
acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect of it, the right of claim is treated as
having accrued on the date of acknowledgement or payment, and runs for six years from that date.
In 2001, the Law Commission published a report on certain proposed reforms to the Limitations
Act 1980 to, among other things, shorten the current statute of limitations period for certain types
of claims in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from six years to three years. In the event that
the statutory limitation periods were to be reduced in the future, the value of purchased debt on
our financial statements could be reduced because the portion of amounts recovered and
recoverable would likely decrease, leading to significant impairment charges as a result of loan
portfolios carrying value reductions. A reduction in the statutory limitation period may also reduce
the market size for debt purchase opportunities, and increase marginal costs in the debt collection
industry, as court proceedings might be initiated earlier in the credit cycle. Although there has been
no change to the limitation period for the collection of debts as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, there can be no assurance that the statute of limitations period for enforcement of
payment obligations will not be shortened in the future in the various jurisdictions in which we
now operate or may in the future operate.

**Changes to commission structures in the UK. Where we outsource some of our**

collections to our DCA partners in the UK on a largely contingent basis, with DCAs being paid a
commission based on collections achieved, any change in laws or regulations restricting or
prohibiting this practice of Contingent Collections could cause us to have to change such
arrangements with our DCA partners to less variable cost structures, such as fixed fee
arrangements. This would increase our fixed cost base, thereby causing Collection Activity and
Fund Management Costs (i.e., the direct costs of external collections related to our purchased loan
portfolios such as commissions paid to third-party outsourced providers, in-house collection costs,
credit bureau data costs and legal costs associated with collections) to rise without necessarily
increasing Balance Sheet Cash Collections. Although we are not currently aware of any such
proposal in relation to DCAs or other participants in the debt purchase and collection industries,
similar restrictions were introduced for independent financial advisers and other firms as part of
the FSA’s retail distribution review. These firms can no longer earn provider-determined
commissions for successful recommendations of retail investment products but must instead be
paid an adviser charge, which is agreed with retail clients in advance. If such change were to be
implemented in relation to the debt purchase and collection industries this could negatively affect
our ability to operate successfully using our current business model, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**Indirect effects. Any changes in the rules and regulations of courts in the jurisdictions in**

which we operate or may in the future operate, which we use regularly to collect on accounts, such
as a material increase in applicable fees paid by us, could adversely affect our gross margin.

The legislative and regulatory environment is also challenging for Investment Portfolio

Sellers, third-party servicing clients and LP investors in our funds, which impacts us because it


-----

influences the availability and pricing of available investments and servicing opportunities.
Regulators require lenders and debt collectors to assess affordability and suitability of products
offered to consumers and to exercise “forbearance” in relation to consumer debt, accept low
repayment offers and refrain from placing customers under undue pressure in relation to the
repayment of debt. Although primarily focused on particular sectors of the market, such as high
cost credit or where customers are non-prime or vulnerable, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted
the consumer credit and consumer mortgage servicing markets regarding forbearance more
broadly. To the extent that new, or amended, laws or regulations in any jurisdiction in which we
operate reduce the return on investments that accrue to investors and/or the profitability of issuing
credit and result in lower credit issuance volumes, there could be reduced demand for fund and
investment management, asset management and servicing and a reduced supply of portfolios for
sale, which could, among other things, lead us to either decrease our fees and lower profitability
for us or increase our prices and lower returns on investments.

Depending on their nature and scope, changes to laws, practices, regulations and guidance

could require additional investment and resources in our risk and compliance governance
frameworks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

**_The ability to obtain, process, share and retain customer data is critical to us and is heavily_**
**_regulated by privacy, data protection and related laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate_**
**_and improper disclosure of our clients’ sensitive data, consumer data or a breach of data_**
**_protection laws could negatively affect our reputation, business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our ability to conduct our business, including in relation to pricing portfolios, tracing

consumers and developing tailored repayment plans, depends in large part on our ability to use
personal data in our consumer data intelligence systems and our ability to share account level data
with DCAs and other servicers to enhance collections. We handle and process large amounts of
potentially sensitive or confidential information, such as personal information of clients, including
names and account numbers, locations, contact information and other account specific data. Our
ability to obtain, retain, share and otherwise manage such data is governed by data protection and
privacy requirements and regulatory rules and guidance.

**GDPR and UK GDPR. The GDPR, and the GDPR as it forms part of the law of the United**

Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), impose a
considerable compliance burden on the asset management and debt purchase industries and
restricts our ability to use data, including through the requirement for informed opt-in consent by
clients to the processing of their personal data, granting clients a “right to be forgotten” (which
may give the clients the right to have their data deleted in certain cases), imposing restrictions on
taking decisions about individuals based solely on automated processing of their data, imposing
disclosure requirements about data sources to our clients and, depending on the breach, imposing
a fine for compliance failures of up to 20 million euro under the GDPR and up to 17,500,000
pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of annual global
turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. In addition, the GDPR and UK GDPR
increases the ability of data subjects to recover substantial damages for breaches of the legislation,
and allows representative bodies (such as consumer organizations) to make claims on behalf of


-----

data subjects. We, along with other market participants, have also experienced a significant
increase in the number of subject access requests. These changes have and may continue to
increase our data protection costs and restrict our ability to conduct our business, which may have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

**Local regulation.**

In addition to the foregoing:

    - In the UK, as a debt purchaser, we must comply with the requirements established by

the DPA in relation to processing the personal data of our clients, including maintaining
the appropriate data protection registrations with the ICO. We may also be penalized if
one of the contributors of data to us or if we, as a service provider, were to violate data
protection laws or other regulatory requirements.

    - In the Netherlands, any personal data we process as a debt purchaser must take place

in compliance with the GDPR and the supplementary GDPR implementing act
(Uitvoeringswet Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming, the “UAVG”), as
applicable, and any relevant regulatory guidance issued by the Dutch Data Protection
Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, the “AP”) and European Data Protection
Board (the “EDPB”).

    - In Portugal, we are required to comply with local law on personal data protection. Any

regulatory changes that impair our ability to continue our current use of consumer data
in our systems or our ability to share data could have a material adverse effect on our
operations. In addition, debt purchasers in Portugal do not gain access to personal data
such as debtors’ names and addresses until completion of portfolio purchases. This lack
of data makes it more challenging for us to effectively evaluate potential purchasing
opportunities in Portugal.

    - In Italy, we are required to comply with the provisions of the GDPR, as well as

Legislative Decree No. 196 of June 30, 2003, as subsequently amended and
supplemented from time to time (the Italian Data Protection Code, the “IDPC”) and
the implementing regulations and decisions issued by the Data Protection and Privacy
Authority.

    - In Ireland, Mars Capital Ireland is required to comply with the GDPR, the Irish Data

Protection Acts and any binding guidance and/or codes or practice issued by the Irish
Data Protection Commission (“DPC”) or the EDPB.

Were we to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, we would be subject to

additional local requirements which might give rise to similar or additional risks.

Any failure to comply with the foregoing could result in the revocation of our licenses,

enforcement notices, monetary fines, criminal charges, breach of contract damages, prohibition on
processing personal data, and reputational damage.


-----

We may not be able to prevent the improper disclosure or processing of sensitive

information in breach of contract and applicable law. The databases containing client data are
vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications and network
failures and natural disasters. The databases are also vulnerable to human acts both by individuals
outside of the Group as well as our employees, including fraud, identity theft and other misuse of
personal data. Moreover, our systems may be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, computer
viruses and similar disruptive problems. Any security or privacy breaches of our data could expose
us to liability, increase our expenses relating to resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation
and deter clients from conducting business with us. Any material failure to process consumer data
in compliance with applicable laws could result in the revocation of our licenses, monetary fines,
criminal charges and breach of contractual arrangements.

Any of the foregoing sanctions under local, EU or UK legislation could have a material

adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**Other Risks Relating to our Operations**

**_Our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been and may_**
**_continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic._**

In March 2020, the global spread of COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the

World Health Organization. The outbreak has resulted in governments and businesses throughout
the world implementing numerous measures intended to contain and limit the spread of the
COVID-19 virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, self-isolation, heightened
border controls and lockdown orders, business restrictions, shutdowns and other limitations. We
sought to protect our employees and moved rapidly to working from home for our employees. The
COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain nonessential businesses have created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected,
and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented restrictions on individuals and businesses
all around the world, and materially impacted the global economy. Despite significant
governmental intervention, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the UK, European and
global economies, with considerable uncertainty of the effects that this will have on employment,
real estate values and other health and economic factors.

In line with the impacts on many other businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our

cash collections during March 2020 and reduced cash collections to their lowest point in April
2020 as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated. Moreover, lockdown measures were
introduced in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and impacting our
ability to litigate and operate as normal.

Although an economic recovery is partially underway, it continues to be uneven and

characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, with uncertainty regarding its
ultimate length and trajectory. As such, we remain cautious in our approach to both investment in
new portfolio investments and the valuation of our ERC.


-----

The longer the COVID-19 pandemic impacts activity levels in the locations and sectors in

which we operate, the more likely it is to have a sustained, material adverse impact on us. In
particular, issues with respect to the distribution or adoption of vaccines or the spread of variants
of the virus could result in new restrictions being imposed by governments and businesses and
lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-COVID-19
pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. These and other factors may delay a return to
ordinary course economic activity before the COVID-19 pandemic, or cause the UK and European
economies or other major global economies to experience a recession. As such, the scale and scope
of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, financial
performance and operating results, which may be material and affect us in ways that we cannot
foresee at this time. Many of the adverse ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact us
have already materialized (and may in the future materialize or adversely affect us), including the
negative impact on our ERC valuation, the operations of our businesses, our creditors, our
counterparties, as well as our customers. The risks from the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar
pandemics, may, in the future, become even more significant than is currently the case or than is
currently anticipated.

If and when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the market turmoil and other changes

associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting effects on our business and operations.
The proliferation of remote working may result in long-term changes to market, consumer and
workplace practices that could negatively impact us. In addition, consumer practices and demands
may permanently, or for an extended period of time, change from what they were prior to the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we fail to adapt investment strategies to these and other changes,
this could adversely impact the returns on the Fund’s investments and, consequently, our business.
Although it is impossible to predict with certainty the potential full magnitude of the business and
economic effects, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may further impact, our business in
various ways, including but not limited to:

    - Difficult market and economic conditions may adversely impact our customers and/or

real estate prices, which, with other impacts, may affect the collections on our and the
Fund’s portfolios, our ERC valuation, our Asset Management and Servicing third-party
clients and revenues, the level investments made by our Fund and Investment
Management business and the overall performance of our business.

    - The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases the challenges associated with

business planning, strategy, execution, portfolio management, fundraising and other
aspects of our business operations. Neither we, the Fund nor our counterparties,
suppliers or advisors have previously faced a situation that is comparable to the
COVID-19 pandemic which, among other factors, involves a major simultaneous
supply and demand shock to global, regional and national economies and significant
outsize effects on particular business sectors. The future trajectory of the COVID-19
pandemic is subject to a complex interplay of epidemiological, technological, social,
psychological, economic and political factors that are generally beyond our ability to
forecast or control. In this environment, historical comparisons may be of little or no
value, while the risk and uncertainty associated with a large number of business
decisions are materially increased.


-----

    - Limitations on travel and social distancing requirements implemented in response to

the COVID-19 pandemic challenge our ability to market new funds as anticipated prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially resulting in reduced or delayed revenue. In
addition, LP investors may become restricted by their asset allocation policies from
investing in new funds that we provide, because these policies often restrict the amount
that they are permitted to invest in alternative assets like the strategies employed by the
Fund when there is a decline in public equity markets. Further, the COVID-19
pandemic may cause LP investors to change their investment strategies in manners that
we cannot foresee, and that may additionally and negatively affect our ability to raise
future funds.

    - While the market dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would be expected

to present attractive investment opportunities, due to increased volatility in the financial
markets, we may not be able to compete for those investments.

    - The regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic (in the form of government

approved legislative moratoria to provide repayment relief to individuals affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic, among others), remains uncertain with the real potential for
changes in the efficacy of litigation strategies to collect customers’ debts. This has the
potential to change current ERC valuations, as well as to cause the pricing of unsecured
consumer debt to be more difficult and less attractive in the future.

    - If the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we and the Fund may have more

limited opportunities to successfully exit existing investments, due to, among other
reasons, lower valuations, decreased revenue and earnings, lack of potential buyers
with financial resources to pursue an acquisition, or limited or no ability to conduct
initial public offerings in equity capital markets, resulting in a reduced ability to realize
value from such investments.

    - Our DCAs, other servicers and outsource partners have also faced disruption and may

face in the future increased credit and liquidity risk due to volatility in financial
markets, reduced revenue streams and limited or higher costs of access to funding,
which may result in disruption to our business, including but not limited to potential
impairment of our investments.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect our

business, financial conditions and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors
that are unpredictable, including, among others: the duration and scope of the COVID-19
pandemic; governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global
economic activity, unemployment levels and financial markets, including the possibility of a
global recession and volatility in the global capital markets which, among other factors, may
increase the our cost of capital and adversely impact our access to capital. In addition, we cannot
predict the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business and the
Fund’s investments.


-----

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, net

income and cash flows. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten or
exacerbate many of the other risks discussed in this section.

**_Changes in the economic and/or political environment and/or the climate in the markets in_**
**_which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

As of June 30, 2021, our 84-Month ERC originated by Investment Portfolio Sellers in the

UK, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland were 36%, 26%, 21%, 15% and 2%. In addition,
our Asset Management and Servicing business provides services to third-party clients and our
Fund and Investment Management business operates, in these jurisdictions. We are, therefore,
exposed to economic, market, fiscal, regulatory, legislative, political and social conditions in the
each of the foregoing jurisdictions. Each of the foregoing jurisdictions has experienced recession
in the last 10 years.

Improvement in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could affect our

business and performance in various ways, including an increase in collections due to rises in real
estate prices, and an increase in the amount of one-off payments and early repayments made by
customers. It could also lead to a reduction in the number of attractive portfolio opportunities
which are available for us to invest in, and more competitive pricing, as financing becomes more
widely available for competitors at a lower cost of funding.

Conversely, sustained effects of prolonged economic weakness, and poor prospects for

economic growth, in the markets in which we operate could have various impacts on our business
and performance, primarily and as a direct result of the effects of weak economic conditions on
our customers. If the global economy suffers a prolonged, material downturn (including as a result
of COVID-19) that affects the markets we operate in through, among other things, an increase in
the unemployment rate, volatility or decline in real estate prices, increased inflation, the
implementation of enhanced austerity measures (such as reduction in the relevant government’s
provisions of public benefits and/or public sector employment), reduced disposable income,
impacting interest rates, and the availability of credit, consumers may be unable or unwilling to
continue repaying debt, and we may not be able to collect debt successfully in a manner consistent
with our past practice. If our consumers experience a reduced ability or willingness to pay their
debt, we could face increased servicing costs and lower average payments, thereby reducing our
cash generation and returns on capital, and, in turn, our ERC.

The volatility and uncertainty that affected the banking system and financial markets

during the global financial crisis and the period that followed resulted in a contraction of credit
markets. In particular, there was a significant shift in the collections environment as a result of the
collapse of the sub-prime lending market in 2008, which resulted in the tightening of capital
requirements and lending standards, such as those introduced in the UK in April 2014 as a result
of the Mortgage Market Review, a UK based investigation of the mortgage market that was
conducted following the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, governments in many countries
responded to adverse economic conditions by introducing various austerity measures, such as cuts
in public benefits and public sector employment. In the UK, this included wide-ranging reform of


-----

the benefits system, including the introduction of a universal credit and a cap on the total amount
of benefits that most people of working age can receive.

The effects of factors such as tightened lending standards, the COVID-19 pandemic, and

welfare reforms may reduce the propensity of financial institutions to lend to customers, leading
to a reduced supply of debt available for purchase, as well as negatively affecting our customers
by reducing disposable income levels or otherwise impairing their ability to service payment
obligations. The effect may be more pronounced for us given the proportion of the portfolios
purchased in the financial services sector.

More recently, we have seen increased inflation, or the potential for increased inflation,

that could lead to increased collections given the potential for increased real-estate prices.
Increased inflation, however, could also squeeze customers’ disposable incomes and/or lead to
increased interest rates, both of which would likely be detrimental to our collections performance.

In addition, greater restrictions on international trade could, if implemented, eventually

increase costs, decrease margins and reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered
by European companies, which could, in turn, adversely affect the economies of the markets in
which we operate.

Furthermore, since we invest in portfolios containing real estate assets, any impact from

climate change, such as localized flooding, could result in a reduction in the value of the underlying
real estate asset, in turn leading to a lower expected collection.

As a result of the foregoing, our future growth, results of operations and financial condition

could be materially adversely affected either as a direct result of reduced collections or because of
valuation impairments.

**_Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the nature of the future_**
**_relationship between the UK and the European Union is likely to be a source of instability in_**
**_international markets, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our_**
**_business and result in new regulatory challenges and costs._**

The UK left the European Union on January 31, 2020, but remained in the European

Union’s customs union and single market for a transitional period that expired on December 31,
2020. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the European Union announced that they had agreed to
a new trade and cooperation deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) governing certain
aspects of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union. The Trade and
Cooperation Agreement applies from January 1, 2021 and provides clarity in respect of the
intended shape of the future relationship between the UK and the European Union and some
detailed matters of trade and cooperation but does not address substantive future cooperation with
respect to financial services or reciprocal market access under so-called “equivalence”
arrangements. In addition, UK service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the
entire European Union single market and free movement of goods is subject to increased
bureaucracy. Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains provisions on short-term
business visits without visas or work permits, this does not amount to the free provision of services
nor the free movement between the European Union and the UK. The loss of these benefits,


-----

together with the ongoing uncertainty with respect to financial services under the Trade and
Cooperation Agreement, could impact the attractiveness of the UK as a global business and
financial center. Although the long-term impact of such changes, and of Brexit more broadly, is
uncertain, Brexit may have an adverse effect on the rate of economic growth in the UK and the
European Union, which may negatively impact asset values in those regions.

Additionally, given the size and global significance of the UK’s economy, ongoing

uncertainty related to Brexit and the relationship between the UK and the European Union could
cause instability in the European Union, UK or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or
market conditions. Uncertainty in respect of such conditions could result in the relocation of
businesses and people, cause business interruptions, cause currency fluctuations (including in
relation to pounds sterling and the Euro), lead to trade restrictions and increases in or the
imposition of trade tariffs, lead to economic recession or depression, affect the availability of credit
and impact the stability of the financial markets, political systems, financial institutions and the
financial and monetary system. By extension, this may adversely affect our ability to source
attractive investments in the European Union and may impact the value of our investments that
are located in the European Union, or those that conduct business in or derive revenue from the
European Union. The uncertainty surrounding the UK’s future relationship with the European
Union could also adversely affect our funds, including the Fund, the performance of their
investments and their ability to source investment opportunities. In addition, Brexit will likely
increase our cost of raising capital, and conducting business generally, including the potential to
suffer withholding tax and the cost of complying with two, potentially divergent, regimes. Changes
in regulation may also impair our ability to recruit, retain and motivate new employees and retain
key employees. Moreover, any Brexit-related effects are also likely to be compounded by the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the evolution of any agreements (or lack

thereof) that the UK makes to retain access to European Union markets. Brexit is likely to impact
the legal rights and obligations of commercial parties across all industries, including the financial
services industry. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent
national laws and regulations as the UK determines which European Union laws to replace or
replicate, which could present new regulatory costs and challenges and could potentially disrupt
the markets we serve, our ability to market our products and services to investors or conduct other
regulated activity in the European Union. Accordingly, any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Terrorist attacks, war and threats of attacks and war may materially and adversely affect_**
**_consumer spending, and in turn, our financial condition, financial returns and results of_**
**_operation._**

Terrorist attacks in the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and other countries in

which we operate, such as Luxembourg and Jersey, as well as war and threats of war or actual
conflicts in these countries, may dramatically and adversely impact the economies of the countries
in which we operate and cause consumer confidence, reduction in real estate prices, unemployment
and spending to decrease. Any of these occurrences could affect our ability to collect our
receivables, provide services to our clients and/or generate returns for us and LP investors in our


-----

Fund and Investment Management business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operation.

**_Rising interest rates could impair the ability of customers to pay their debts and/or lead to_**
**_volatility in real estate prices which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

Since the global credit crisis in 2008, interest rates have remained low and in certain

territories are negative. If interest rates rise, this could impair the financial viability of customers
who have variable interest rate obligations (such as home mortgages) or other significant debt that
bears floating rate interest, as well as leading to reductions in real estate prices. This could, directly
or indirectly, lead to a reduction in customers’ disposable income and, as a result, their ability to
repay their debts to us. If our customers experience a reduced ability to pay their debts, DCAs and
servicers may require higher commissions to address increased Collection Activity and Fund
Management Costs, and we could face higher payment plan default rates and lower average
payments, which together with lower real estate prices could reduce our cash generation, return on
capital and ERC. Even if we are able to develop payment plans in relation to certain of these
obligations, such measures may prove unsuccessful. Further, we could more quickly reach a point
of saturation with certain customers (i.e., the number of accounts matched to a customer may reach
a point at which that customer lacks the financial means to pay on all of the accounts that we own).
Even if our efforts were to prove successful in avoiding some defaults, total collections may still
decline and/or the timing of receipt of payments may lengthen, any of which would impair our
financial condition and materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, rising
interest rates may increase our financing costs, which may result in our inability to finance
portfolio purchases at profitable levels or at all.

**_There may not be sufficient supply of portfolios, or appropriately priced portfolios, available for_**
**_purchase, and a decrease in our ability to purchase portfolios could materially adversely affect_**
**_our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The availability of portfolios at prices that generate profits for the Fund, future funds and

our Balance Sheet business may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are
outside our control, including:

    - the level of consumer confidence and consumer spending;

    - reduced availability of credit to consumers, which could be driven by a number of

factors, including heightened regulation of the credit card and consumer lending
industry, changing credit origination strategies, tighter lending criteria introduced by
consumer credit providers and general economic conditions;

    - the level of non-performance of consumer portfolios and an increased proportion of

such portfolios that are written off by debt originators, which also in turn may affect
the availability of credit to consumers;

    - the level of sales of portfolios by Investment Portfolio Sellers, which could be

jeopardized by a change in laws or regulations, a change in accounting policies or


-----

practices, the consolidation of creditors, increased reliance on DCAs or increased
sophistication in internal collection efforts;

    - potential concerns on the part of debt originators that the relatively small value received

for portfolios as a percentage of their face value may not outweigh the potential
reputational risks or required management attention associated with selling portfolios;

    - negative publicity or a loss of trust in the debt purchase and collection industry and in

the financial services industry, whether due to the failure of one or more market
participants to meet their legal or regulatory obligations or otherwise;

    - increased regulation of the circumstances in which Investment Portfolio Sellers have a

right to create debt and a right to collect on debt;

    - an increase in demand for portfolios among competitors could result in our not being

chosen to purchase a portfolio due to more attractive offers from competitors; and

    - the macroeconomic conditions in, and policies of, the countries in which we operate.

For example, in an improving economic environment there may be a lag in any increase
in the supply of portfolios available for purchase as debt originators adjust the level of
new debt originated to maintain target default levels. Conversely, in a deteriorating
economic environment, a high proportion of defaulted consumer debt may be serviced
in-house or by DCAs, leaving fewer purchasing opportunities for debt purchasers, such
as us, as debt originators’ propensity to sell defaulted consumer debt at prices
prevailing in the market declines. See “—Changes in the economic and/or political
_environment and/or the climate in the markets in which we operate may have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_

The impact of macro factors on our business was demonstrated by events in 2009, during

which the UK market for defaulted consumer debt sales decreased significantly. This decline was
primarily due to restrictions on the availability of funding for debt purchases and the general
contraction of credit during the ensuing recession, lower collections of payments from portfolios
and lower volumes of portfolios being offered by Investment Portfolio Sellers as a result of
decreased demand and lower spot prices. In addition, debt originators altered their debt
management practices, in response to lower prices, by warehousing their “fresh” and semiperforming portfolios in anticipation of better prices and directing the collection of such portfolios
to DCAs, while offering older, often secondary and tertiary debt, to the debt purchase market.
Further, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our cash collections during March 2020 which reduced
to their lowest point in April 2020 as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated, and lockdown
measures were introduced in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and
impacting our ability to litigate and operate as normal.

In addition, Investment Portfolio Sellers may develop technological tools that they believe

are more effective in terms of tracing technology and customer profile development. If Investment
Portfolio Sellers choose to perform more of their debt collections internally as a result of these
data quality improvements or otherwise, the volume of portfolio sales or the quality of underlying
debt sold could decrease and, consequently, we may not be able to buy the type and quantity of


-----

portfolios at prices consistent with our historical return targets. In addition, there could be a
reduction in the availability of portfolios sold early in the collections cycle that have been subject
to little or no collections activity. This fresher debt typically has higher collection expectations
because less work has been applied to the assets to obtain customer payments.

Further, regulation may diminish the supply of defaulted debt for sale in the event that debt

originators are unable to extend credit to the same extent as they have been able to do historically.

If we are unable to purchase portfolios from Investment Portfolio Sellers at appropriate

prices, or if one or more Investment Portfolio Sellers stop or decrease their sales of portfolios due
to any of the factors listed above or for any other reason, or if we do not replace the Existing
Portfolios that we collect from with additional portfolios, we could lose a significant potential
source of income and our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition may be
materially adversely affected.

**_We may not be able to procure sufficient funding to purchase further portfolios as they become_**
**_available on acceptable terms or at all._**

One aspect of our business depends on our ability to purchase, in the ordinary course,

portfolios of non-performing debt and non-core assets. Historically, we have funded such
purchases through borrowings and cash generated by our operations and capital injections by our
shareholders. Our ability to obtain funding from the debt capital markets, our shareholders or the
loan market in the future will depend on our performance and our prospects, as well as factors over
which we do not exercise control. Such factors may include weak economic and capital market
conditions during or prior to periods in which attractive portfolios are available for purchase, the
ability and willingness of banks to lend to our industry generally or to us in particular, and changes
in fiscal, monetary and other government policies, among others. If we do not have sufficient
headroom in the Revolving Facility (or if it is fully drawn), we may be unable to draw down the
Revolving Facility or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or on a timely basis to portfolio
purchases, which in turn may limit our ability to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio
purchases arising in the market and/or develop our Fund and Investment Management and Asset
Management and Servicing businesses. The Indenture will place, restrictions on our ability to incur
indebtedness. If we are unable to borrow, generate or otherwise obtain sufficient funds to purchase
portfolios on attractive terms, or at all, when opportunities arise, our business, results of operations
and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We may be unable to compete with businesses that offer higher prices for portfolios or may_**
**_otherwise face intensive competitive pressure._**

Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to create a strong flow of investment

opportunities, there are many active participants in the markets that we operate in and we are
currently experiencing highly competitive primary market auction processes. As such, we seek to
acquire a substantial portion of our portfolios off-market. Any change in the appetite of Investment
Portfolio Sellers to sell portfolios off-market, an increase in competition for off-market purchases
and/or our inability to source appropriate levels of off-market trades could reduce the returns that
we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of LP investors, can generate. We may also face competition
from financial investors. The existence of a national identification system in new markets (such as


-----

continental European countries) could negatively affect the competitive advantage of our datadriven business model, thereby negatively affecting our ability to compete for portfolio purchases
in such markets. Our inability or unwillingness to compete on the basis of price (or, if competitors
are able to operate more efficiently or at greater scale), could have a material adverse effect on our
prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may be unable to acquire the level or type of portfolios that we expect or have historically_**
**_acquired following the development of our Fund and Investment Management business._**

Since the launch of the Fund, our investments have typically been made through a 25% co
investment alongside the Fund through our 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA. It is our
intention that for future funds, our level of co-investment may decrease from the current 25% to
approximately 10% as we reduce our investment in the more capital intensive Balance Sheet
business and grow our capital-light revenues through the development of our Fund and Investment
Management and our Asset Management and Servicing businesses.

In the event that the Fund Manager is unable to acquire the expected level of portfolios,

then the investment by Arrow SMA will be below our expectations, resulting in lower revenue and
collections than anticipated.

Furthermore, there is a risk that the type and characteristics of portfolios acquired by the

Fund Manager have different characteristics from portfolios acquired before the development of
our Fund and Investment Management business. The attractiveness of a portfolio for LP investors,
and hence the Fund or future funds (which could potentially be structured differently than the
Fund), may be different from Arrow SMA. For example, the Fund and future funds may have a
different appetite for minimum target returns and/or a smooth collections profile. Our inability to
acquire the level or type of portfolios that we expect or have historically acquired could have a
material adverse effect on our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Other businesses may develop competitive advantages that we cannot match, which may reduce_**
**_our access to and success in competitive sale processes for portfolios._**

We operate in markets that are competitive. We face competition from new and existing

purchasers of portfolios as well as fund and asset managers. We purchase a broad range of
portfolios and often these portfolios are acquired through an off-market sales process. Our
origination capabilities to source such portfolio acquisitions is an important competitive
advantage. In the future, our current competitors and any new competitors may have or may in the
future develop substantially greater origination, underwriting, financial, technical, personnel or
other resources such as more effective pricing and collection models, more efficient operating
structures, greater adaptability to changing market needs and more established relationships in the
debt purchase industry than us.

Our Asset Management and Servicing business supports our investment in portfolio

acquisitions made by our Balance Sheet business and by our Fund and Investment Management
business. However, certain competitors have more significant debt collection businesses, in
addition to operations involving the purchase of portfolios. These competitors may be able to
service portfolios more efficiently and/or offer originators a “bundle” of services, or they may be


-----

able to better use the consumer data to help them price portfolios more accurately. Competitors
have acquired, and may in the future acquire, DCAs that we place accounts with. This, and
potential consolidation of DCAs, may result in accounts being recalled. In the future, we may not
have the resources or the ability to compete successfully in certain segments of the market.

We may not be able to maintain the synergies, or the advantages in tracing technology,

customer profile development or low Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs or asset
management that we believe we currently possess. Moreover, the industry may shift away from a
debt purchase model of collecting distressed debt. If we are unable to develop and expand our
business or adapt to changing market needs as effectively as our current or future competitors do,
or if our competitors are able to operate at a lower cost of capital or make improvements in their
pricing or collections methods that we are not able to make, we, alongside the Fund and future
funds, may be unable to access, and be successful in, competitive sale processes for portfolios
and/or viable investment assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects,
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The value of our Existing Portfolios may deteriorate, or we may not be able to collect sufficient_**
**_amounts on our portfolios to take advantage of opportunities for portfolio purchases as they_**
**_arise in the market._**

We purchase, either directly for our Balance Sheet business or on behalf of LP investors,

portfolios of defaulted debt and other non-core assets, which often consist of a substantial number
of accounts without contact details for which the Investment Portfolio Seller has made numerous
(unsuccessful) attempts to collect. Such debt may subsequently be deemed uncollectable and
written off. Our purchased portfolios include both Paying Accounts, which consist of accounts that
have shown at least one payment over the preceding three months or at least two payments over
the preceding six months, and non-Paying Accounts, which may be higher risk and have less
predictable cash flows than Paying Accounts, as well as real estate and/or other assets, such as
cash in court or tax credits. Although we estimate that the recoveries on our purchased portfolios
will be in excess of the amount we paid for them, amounts recovered may be less than expected
and may even be less than the total amount paid for such portfolios. Any condition or development
that causes these portfolios to lose value, such as a decrease in expected collections or a reduction
in secured asset values leading to lower collections, will have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

As collecting on our Existing Portfolios may take a long time, and the factors affecting

debt collection rates may be volatile and outside our control, we may not be able to identify
economic trends or make changes in our purchasing strategies in a timely manner. We may not be
able to achieve the levels of collections forecast prior to purchase of any debt, or collect anything
at all. In addition, the assumptions used in our models may be incorrect or some of the accounts in
a portfolio may behave differently from the way we expect. For example, accounts in foreign
jurisdictions may have direct debt instructions that are more challenging to engage, resulting in
lower collections on such accounts. Court processing delays and the length of the judicial process
generally in jurisdictions such as Portugal and Italy could lead to collections failing to meet
expectations. Any of these factors could result in a loss of value in a portfolio after purchase and
a continuing deterioration in value over time as actual collections can deviate significantly from
the collection estimates produced by our pricing model.


-----

If the cash flows from our Existing Portfolios (and the portfolios we purchase in the future)

are less than anticipated, we may have difficulty servicing our indebtedness and may be unable to
purchase new portfolios that we would like to purchase. In addition, returns to LP investors of the
Fund or future funds may be impacted, resulting in limited or no performance fee income from the
Fund or future funds and an inability to successfully raise commitments from LP investors for
future funds. As a result, our future growth, business, results of operations and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected.

**_The statistical models and analytical tools we use in our business, including in our calculation_**
**_of ERC and Net Deal IRR, may prove to be inaccurate and we may not achieve anticipated_**
**_recoveries._**

We use internally developed models and other data analytics tools extensively in our

business operations. For example, we use a portfolio valuation model to project remaining cash
flow generation from purchased portfolios, our ERC and our Net Deal IRR. However, at the time
of purchase, we are likely to have imperfect information about the precise age of the receivables,
the ability of the customer to pay, the valuation of real estate assets, the time at which the customer
will pay or the real estate will be disposed of and the cost required to service and collect on such
debts/assets and it may take several years for us to recoup the original purchase price of our
investment in portfolios. Moreover, information based on historical market behavior and statisticbased historical models may not accurately predict, or be indicative of, the characteristics of
subsequent portfolios purchased from the same Investment Portfolio Seller or the same industry
due to changes in business practices or economic developments. In addition, if we purchase types
of portfolios with which we have limited experience, or purchase portfolios in geographies in
which we have no prior experience, or from Investment Portfolio Sellers with whom we have had
no prior dealings, our ability to properly price and to collect on such portfolios may be adversely
affected.

Our statistical models and analytical tools assess information provided by third parties,

such as credit bureaus and other mainstream or public sources, or generated by software products.
These models, together with our local expertise, external or desktop valuations for secured assets
and our assessment of recoverability for certain assets, are used within the business to formulate
the ERC, which is a key input to the valuation of portfolio investments held on the balance sheet.
These models also use an assessment of the economic conditions and future actual collections
performance may be different from the modelled ERC.

If we are not able to achieve forecasted levels of collections, valuation impairments may

be recognized, amortization may increase, and revenue and returns on portfolio purchases may be
reduced. These risks may be exacerbated to the extent our statistical models and analytical tools
fail to accurately forecast the key performance indicators.

Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

operations and financial condition. For further details, see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_We are highly dependent on our data analytics systems and proprietary customer profiles, and_**
**_if we lost access to such data or if the quality and quantity of such data is reduced, or if_**
**_competitors develop comparable tools, our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations could be materially adversely affected._**

Our core data analytics systems and customer databases provide information that is critical

to our business. We rely on publicly available data provided by multiple credit reference agencies,
servicing partners and other sources, to operate our business. For example, Focum in the
Netherlands provides customer information to minimize credit and payment risks for businesses.
Any loss of access to the use of such data would impact the reliability of our models and/or our
platforms. Additionally, we could lose a significant competitive advantage and our business could
be negatively affected if:

    - any third-party sources were to stop providing this data for any reason, including a

change in laws or regulations, or considerably raise the price of their services;

    - any of the proprietary information or data that we use were to become public, including

as a result of a change in law or regulation;

    - the UK or other jurisdictions were to introduce measures that have the effect of

facilitating the tracing of consumers (such as a national identification system which,
unlike the national insurance number system, is accessible as part of the credit process);
or

    - the current data processing restrictions were to change such that credit market

participants could access credit bureau data before the purchase of portfolios.

Furthermore, private or public providers of our data could make claims that the way in

which we use information and data violates terms and conditions applicable to such use, and,
whether or not such claims have merit, our reputation could be harmed and our ability to continue
to use such information and data in the manner in which it is currently used could be impaired.

If our competitors are able to develop or procure similar or more effective systems or

methods to develop and process data, or if we become unable to continue to acquire, aggregate or
use such information and data in the manner or to the extent in which it is currently permitted, we
may lose a significant competitive advantage and our prospects, business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Further, if our competitors, Investment Portfolio Sellers or other third parties create similar

or more effective data sharing platforms, we may lose some or all of our data advantage. Any data
analytics tools developed by third parties or competitors could improve the quality of data
available to Investment Portfolio Sellers, enabling better tracing of customers and improving
collections, thus diminishing their incentive to sell debt to debt purchasers such as us and reducing
the availability of portfolios for purchase.


-----

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

operations and financial condition, including an impact on the ability to develop our Fund and
Investment Management business.

**_We may not succeed in growing our Fund and Investment Management business revenue, and_**
**_Asset Management and Servicing business revenue and/or such revenue sources may become_**
**_less profitable._**

Our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses

may not generate the levels of revenue we anticipate. Our growth strategy involves building a
scalable and sustainable Fund and Investment Management business that enables us to co-invest
through our Balance Sheet business and service the acquired portfolios, along with other thirdparties, through our Asset Management and Servicing business. As such, we face numerous risks
and uncertainties in connection with the different aspects of our growth strategy. For example:

    - performance, and in particular the returns generated by the Fund or future funds, may

be lower than anticipated and may impact the ability to raise further funding from LP
investors;

    - diminished appetite from LP investors to commit further funding to future funds due to

factors including, but not limited to, our reputation, the regulatory environment, the
macro-economic environment, performance of competitors and other fund managers,
retention of key employees, operational issues and our performance, which could
ultimately impact our ability to raise future funds;

    - weaker collections performance may impact the available cash to re-invest in new

portfolios;

    - management may be unable to provide sufficient focus to all three businesses to enable

each to grow in line with our plans, particularly if there are external factors that disrupt
our businesses;

    - competition from established players in the relevant market or sector may impact our

ability to acquire new third-party asset and management servicing contracts;

    - changes or increases to the regulatory environment may disrupt our current plans,

leading to increased costs; and

    - investment opportunities may be serviced more effectively and/or efficiently by a third
party servicer and, as such, the level of servicing contracts on our Asset Management
and Servicing platforms may be lower than anticipated and/or affect the viability of a
platform in a particular jurisdiction.

In addition, our Asset Management and Servicing business relies upon third-party servicing

contracts. We have increasingly seen opportunities from debt originators, driven in part, by the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to seek asset management and servicing activity from our
platforms. Any failure to win new contracts and/or retain existing clients may affect the growth,


-----

profitability and/or the viability of a platform in a certain jurisdiction. Further, certain contracts
may include multiple activities, some of which may be more profitable than others. In the event
that the scope of servicing contracts was amended to remove the most profitable activities, then
certain servicing contracts, on renewal, may be less or no longer profitable.

Any failure to meet or exceed our growth plans and/or the development of new initiatives

could lead to our failure to reach our expected profitability levels, to achieve lower growth than
forecast and/or not being able to enjoy the benefits that such growth strategy is expected to lead
to. Any of the above may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We may be unable to continue to perform our duties as a fund manager and may be unable to_**
**_raise future funds from third-party LP investors, limiting our ability to grow and decreasing our_**
**_income from management and performance fees._**

Our ability to continue in our role as asset manager and to raise further funds from third
party LP investors depends on a number of factors, which include but are not limited to the
following:

    - The termination of a limited partnership agreement with an LP could result in the

removal of the Fund Manager and/or the general partner of the Fund or future funds
and adversely affect our reputation and the ability to generate management and
performance fees. There are a range of customary termination events for arrangements
of this nature in our limited partnership agreements that grant certain governance and
decision making rights to LPs, including a right to remove the general partner in various
circumstances;

    - A failure to achieve returns above certain targets would restrict the Fund Manager’s

ability to generate performance fees, which are often referred to as carried interest. The
failure to achieve the targeted returns could be as a result of many factors, including
but not limited to, the collections performance of the portfolios, costs incurred with
servicing such portfolios, macro-economic challenges, the competitive environment
and operational challenges;

    - The Fund Manager may be restricted from pursuing certain investment opportunities

due to restrictions within the mandate it has from LP investors or concentration limits
stipulated by the relevant fund agreement. A failure to be able to take advantage of such
opportunities may restrict the returns that the Fund Manager can generate and, thereby
reduce the overall fees that we can generate; and

    - The appetite of LP investors, general availability of funds in the market, our investment

track record and competitor fundraising activity may impact the ability of the Fund
Manager to raise additional funds in due course. The ability to raise further funds under
management is central to our strategy and any failure would have financial
consequences to our performance.


-----

**_The vertical alignment of our local platforms under a fund management framework may not_**
**_prove successful._**

We plan to vertically align our local investment strategies under a fund management

framework with the view to engender accountability of local business leaders and to drive
efficiency gains in our local operations. Our ultimate goal is to eliminate dual-layer costs and
ensure cost savings through removal of duplicate central functions. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to achieve such cost savings. See “Business—Cost Structure Development and
_Cost Saving Opportunities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering_
_Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts_
_that involve risks and uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We_
_have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, and other financial_
_information not prepared in accordance with IFRS.” The movement away from the standard_
horizontal alignment of our local platforms, under the One Arrow model, towards the vertical
alignment of our local platforms, may not realize the cost reductions, synergies, accountability or
efficiencies that we are targeting. Additionally, the decentralization of certain of our functions and
the transferal of such functions to our local operations could adversely impact the synergy among
our local operations. The unsuccessful implementation of the vertical alignment under a fund
management model could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results of operations.

**_We might be unable to maintain key relationships necessary to conduct our business._**

We rely on key relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers, DCAs, other servicers, law

firms, third-party IT providers and data providers such as Experian, among others, to conduct our
business.

A significant decrease in the volume of debt or other non-core assets available for purchase

on acceptable terms from any of our principal Investment Portfolio Sellers would force us to seek
alternative sources of debt/assets to purchase. In addition to the factors that impact the supply of
portfolios generally, Investment Portfolio Sellers with whom we have strategic relationships may
not continue to sell portfolios to us on desirable terms or in acceptable quantities, and we may not
be able to replace such purchases with purchases from other Investment Portfolio Sellers. An
Investment Portfolio Seller’s decision to sell debt/assets to us is based on various factors, including
the price and terms offered and our reputation, scale, track record of completed transactions and
compliance history. The loss of a key relationship with an Investment Portfolio Seller could
jeopardize our existing relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers or our ability to
establish new relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers. We may be unable to find
alternative sources from which to purchase portfolios and, even if such purchases could be
successfully replaced, the search could take time or the debt/assets could be of lower quality or
higher cost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Whilst much of the servicing is undertaken by our servicing platforms, we rely on our

relationships with DCAs and other external servicers to conduct our business. We may lose a key
DCA/servicer relationship for a number of reasons, including as a result of an acquisition by one
of our competitors or the financial failure of a DCA/servicer. This could further increase our
dependence on our remaining key relationships.


-----

We also rely on key third-party IT service providers to supply the majority of our core IT

applications, systems, infrastructure, back-up, storage, data recovery and disaster recovery systems
and the loss of IT support could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations. See “—Our operations are highly dependent upon access to, and the functioning and
_security of, IT applications, systems and infrastructure. A cyber-attack within the business or_
_through the supply chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the_
_confidentiality, integrity or availability could result in financial losses, regulatory sanctions, and_
_reputational damage.”_

Moreover, if any of our significant Investment Portfolio Sellers, DCAs, other servicers,

data providers such as Experian or other credit reference agencies or our third-party technology
providers terminate or modify their relationship with us, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_We would be adversely affected if third parties, including DCAs, law firms and servicers_**
**_performing servicing and other collections activities on our, the Fund’s or future funds’_**
**_portfolios, perform poorly or fail to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements._**

We rely on our third-party service providers, DCAs, external valuers, asset managers and

law firms to direct collection activities, servicing and asset management activities, to ensure
compliance, and to prepare forecasted collection estimates in connection with our, the Fund’s and
future funds’ portfolios. The development of our Fund and Investment Management business has
increased the reliance that we place on a number of counterparties, such as the MoME and the
Depositary. We rely on these third parties to effectively manage collection operations, undertake
aspects of our Fund and Investment Management business, preserve a variable cost structure and
to meet our servicing needs efficiently, but these third parties may not have the resources,
employee training or management experience that we require. This may negatively impact their
ability to comply with applicable laws, other regulatory requirements and our requirements.

Further, these third parties could commit fraud with respect to the customer accounts and

portfolios that we or the Fund Manager place with them or fail to comply with applicable laws and
regulations such as data protection requirements or to provide us with accurate data on the accounts
they are servicing. Also, if any third-party carrying on regulated activities (including the DCAs
and other servicers with which we do business) were unable to obtain regulatory authorization at
the relevant time, we may have to recall accounts from that third-party, which could interrupt
customer payments and result in financial loss for us.

To the extent these third parties violate laws, other regulatory requirements or their

contractual obligations to us, or act inappropriately in the conduct of their business, our business
and reputation could be negatively affected or penalties could be directly imposed on us, as, in the
UK in particular, the FCA expects regulated businesses, such as the UK Regulated Firms, to
comply with its rules and guidance on outsourcing, which means that regulated businesses need to
carefully select any third parties with whom they work and, to a certain degree, take responsibility
for any third-party compliance violations.

Furthermore, the ICO could hold us directly liable for any failure by our DCAs or other

servicers to comply with UK data protection requirements. We may also suffer losses pursuant to


-----

our agreements with Investment Portfolio Sellers who have required, and may require, us to ensure
compliance by sub-contractors with applicable laws or other regulatory requirements.
Furthermore, we may not be aware of the occurrence of any such violations.

In addition, a financially weak DCA or other servicer may be unable to continue to fund

collection activity, including taking steps to actively manage accounts assigned to it, without our
support. Such support, and any strategies that we may implement in respect of underperforming
DCAs or other servicers, may not result in anticipated benefits. If one or more of our DCAs or
other servicers, such as IT suppliers or credit data providers, were to experience financial
difficulties or enter into administration or become insolvent, this could cause disruptions and
delays to our cash flows or prevent us from recovering the full amount paid to the DCA or other
servicer.

Although we may select DCAs and other servicers based on prior relative performance,

there is no guarantee of future performance, and any underperformance on the part of DCAs, other
servicers and other counterparties, whether as a result of failing to meet the financial targets
required by us or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Our growth may strain our resources, affect our ability to maintain our levels of collections or_**
**_affect our ability to implement effective portfolio pricing standards, which could materially_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

We have experienced significant growth in our business and launched our inaugural fund

in late 2019. Our 84-Month ERC grew to £1.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 from £1.0 billion as of
December 31, 2015. Future growth and the development of our Fund and Investment Management
business, among other things, could place a strain on our resources, including but not limited to
resources in our portfolio pricing, origination, change management, information technology, tax,
legal, finance and accounting and other departments, as well as require the expansion of our
procedures for monitoring internal accounting functions, risk management and continued
compliance with regulatory requirements and our reporting obligations. Our expansion within
markets or to new markets will require additional investment of both financial and management
resources to ensure that the business performs as a single enterprise and that the oversight and
monitoring processes are applied consistently in all locations. Any resulting growth of our
employee base may also increase our need for internal audit, training and monitoring processes
that are more extensive and broader in scope than those that we have historically required. Failure
to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and results
of operations. See also “—We may make acquisitions or pursue joint ventures, business
_combinations or other investments that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.”_

**_We may make acquisitions or pursue joint ventures, business combinations or other investments_**
**_that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources._**

In addition to our acquisition of portfolios in the ordinary course, we may seek to grow our

business by acquiring or combining with other businesses through purchases of either assets or
corporate entities, as we have with the acquisitions of businesses such as Zenith, Whitestar,
Capquest and Europa Investimenti. For further details of the key acquisitions we have made, see


-----

“Business—Our History and Development.” Successful growth through future acquisitions is
dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due
diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions and
integrate the acquired business into the Group.

If we make acquisitions, we may not be able to generate expected margins or cash flows,

or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies.
Our assessments of, and assumptions regarding, acquisition targets may prove to be incorrect, and
actual developments may differ significantly from expectations. We may not be able to integrate
acquisitions successfully into our business or such integration may require more investment than
expected, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies with
respect to, among others, customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or to other third
parties, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions of businesses that
operate in jurisdictions other than the jurisdictions in which we operate would subject us to market
practices, as well as regulatory requirements, that differ from those we currently are familiar with,
which may subject us to unanticipated risks. We may also have ongoing obligations to Investment
Portfolio Sellers under the sale and purchase documentation.

In addition, prior to the completion of such acquisitions, the entities in the target group will

not be subject to the covenants included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior
to such date, the seller or any of its subsidiaries will not take an action that would otherwise have
been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable.

Once an acquisition has occurred, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive

to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses or
a decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks, including:

    - legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues;

    - accounting impairments;

    - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

    - difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

    - diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business; and

    - failing to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided.

Moreover, any acquisition may be funded by additional debt, which could reduce our

profitability and harm our business.

We may also choose to enter into joint ventures, business alliances or consortia to acquire

assets or other types of investments (whether under instruments, participations or subparticipations, a total return or pass-through contracts or any other similar arrangements), which
could involve the same or similar risks and uncertainties as are involved in acquisitions of control.
Moreover, to the extent we subsequently increase our level of participation or acquire 100% of the


-----

interests in the assets of any of these joint ventures, business alliances or consortia, we may be
required to pay deferred consideration.

Any arrangement in which we do not fully control business operations has in the past

presented, and may in the future present, greater financial, legal, operational and/or compliance
risks.

**_Companies that we have acquired, are in the process of acquiring or may acquire in the future_**
**_may have liabilities that are not known to us that could subject us to liabilities or contingent_**
**_liabilities that could otherwise have an adverse impact on us, and the indemnity the sellers have_**
**_agreed to provide may not compensate us in full or at all._**

We acquired Parr (now trading as Whitestar Italy) and Europa Investimenti on March 1,

2018 and September 14, 2018, respectively and assumed all of their liabilities. As a result, we are
and would be required to bear the costs of contingent or other liabilities of each of the Italian
targets. Such liabilities could specifically arise, for example if key customers brought claims
against these entities under their respective contracts.

As part of each of the Vesting acquisition, the Parr acquisition, the Europa Investimenti

acquisition and the Drydens acquisition, the sellers have provided customary warranties and
indemnities with respect to certain costs and losses that we may incur as a result of these
acquisitions. However, the warranty and indemnity coverage provided is subject to a cap, is limited
in duration and does not cover all losses that we may incur. Consequently, we may be exposed to
certain liabilities for which we will not be entitled to recover for breach of warranty and/or
indemnification, or the warranties and indemnities the sellers provided may be insufficient to
compensate us for these liabilities. Such losses would need to be borne by us. There may also be
contingent or other liabilities unknown to us that we assumed as a result of the acquisitions.

**_Our operations are highly dependent upon access to, and the functioning and security of, IT_**
**_applications, systems and infrastructure. A cyber-attack within the business or through the_**
**_supply chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the confidentiality,_**
**_integrity or availability could result in financial losses, regulatory sanctions, and reputational_**
**_damage._**

Our success depends in large part on the ability to record and process significant amounts

of data quickly and accurately to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for pricing and
collection activities. We also use our systems to identify large numbers of customers, store
personal data of our customers, analyze and segment accounts, devise efficient collection strategies
and monitor the results of collection efforts. Information stored about customers includes: personal
information of the customer, such as name and account number; location information relating to
the address and telephone numbers for the customer; and account-specific information such as the
date of loan origination, issuance of the card or debt default, write-off date and write-off balance
for the account. Furthermore, while we have various means of disaster recovery protection, the
insolvency, liquidation or entering into administration of our cloud-based IT providers or the
developers of our data management systems, could disrupt operations and materially adversely
affect our respective businesses.


-----

Our information systems could be adversely affected by events outside our control,

including, without limitation, terrorist acts, natural disasters, telecommunications and network
failures and power losses. Our computer systems, our data stored on third-party servers or
applications by means of “cloud computing,” our software and our networks may be vulnerable to
unauthorized access (from within our organization or by third parties), computer viruses or other
malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security impact. Cyber-attacks, in
particular, have become far more prevalent in the past few years, leading potentially to the theft or
manipulation of confidential and proprietary information or loss of access to, or destruction of,
data on systems. If one or more of such events were to occur in respect of our systems, our data,
our software or our networks, it potentially could jeopardize our confidential and other information
processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks or thirdparty platforms, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations.

Remote working environments are less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks,

including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic.
Continued remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce
operational risks, including heightened cyber security risks. In addition, if a natural disaster, power
outage, connectivity issue or other event occurs that impacts the ability of our employees to work
remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue business for a
substantial period of time. Moreover, third party service providers on whom we have become
increasingly reliant for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems,
technology and the administration of certain funds, could be impacted by an inability to perform
due to COVID-19 related restrictions or by failures of, or attacks on, their information systems and
technology.

Any material disruption to, or failure of, our systems, the systems of our third-party service

providers or the systems of the banking and other sectors that are integral to our businesses,
especially if it also impacts our backup or disaster recovery systems, would disrupt our operations
and materially adversely affect our businesses. Any temporary or permanent loss of our ability to
use computer equipment and software systems, or any disruption to or loss of data could disrupt
our operations, result in increased capital expenditure and insurance and operating costs, cause us
to suffer a competitive disadvantage and materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Any security or privacy breach of our systems could expose us
to liability, increase expenses relating to the resolution of these breaches, harm our reputation and
deter LP investors from investing in future funds and Investment Portfolio Sellers from selling
portfolios to us. We could be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our
protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.

Regulators are focused on promoting the protection of customer/client information and the

integrity of information technology systems of regulated firms. Our continued regulatory
authorization is partially dependent on the adequacy of our IT systems and controls.

Additionally, computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are

characterized by short product life cycles. We continually upgrade our IT systems to ensure that
our IT infrastructure continues to deliver appropriate flexibility, control, resilience and cost
effectiveness. The change process, as well as the management of data, may result in technical or
operational difficulties that may require us to remedy problems that arise, which could require


-----

substantial expenditure, time and other resources. We may not be successful in anticipating,
managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis, which could reduce our
profitability or disrupt our operations and harm our business. While we believe that our existing
information systems are sufficient to meet our current demands and continued expansion, our
future growth may require additional investment in these systems. We depend on having the capital
resources necessary to invest in new technologies to acquire and service our debt portfolios. We
cannot ensure you that adequate capital resources will be available to us when we need to make
such investments.

As part of providing asset management services to our third-party clients, we may be

required to build new servicing platforms, enhance our existing servicing platforms and make
improvements to our IT infrastructure that may result in technical and operational difficulties that,
among other things, cause expenditure overruns against budget and delays that may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Further, as some of the systems, technologies and programs that we use have been

developed internally, our level of development documentation may not be comparable to that of
third-party software packages. We may also have certain employees that possess important,
undocumented knowledge of our systems. If any such employee no longer worked for us, our
ability to maintain, repair or modify our data analytics systems and platforms may be limited.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

operations and financial condition.

**_We outsource most of our core IT applications, systems and infrastructure to third-party service_**
**_providers and may have difficulty identifying and retaining suitable alternative service_**
**_providers._**

Our IT infrastructure is built to provide flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness

and we operate a Microsoft first, cloud-based / virtualized approach. As such, we outsource certain
IT applications and infrastructure, including hosting, back-up, data storage, network services and
other services to third-party service providers. We may not be able to find and retain alternative
providers if our current or future providers become financially unstable in the future, are not
performing at a level expected of them by us or are no longer able to service our needs. If we are
not able to find and retain suitable alternative service providers on a timely basis as and when
needed, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely
affected.

**_We may not be able to successfully anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes within_**
**_the debt purchase, fund and asset management and the financial services industries._**

We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes

within the debt purchase, fund and asset management and financial services industries on a timely
basis, which could reduce profitability or disrupt operations and harm our business. While we
believe that our existing information systems and infrastructure are sufficient to meet current
demands and continued expansion, our future growth may require additional investment in these
systems. In particular, the development of our Fund and Investment Management business is likely


-----

to require additional IT systems and infrastructure as it grows. We depend on having the capital
resources necessary to invest in new technologies to acquire and service our portfolios. We may
not have adequate capital resources available when we need to make such investments and if we
are unable to obtain such resources our business, results of operations and financial condition may
be materially adversely affected.

**_The need to adapt to customers’ changing circumstances and changes to real-estate markets_**
**_may result in increased Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs, reduced cash flow or_**
**_imprecise modeling._**

If there are adverse changes in the financial circumstances of our customers after we have

acquired their accounts, including as a result of any reduction in customers’ income or in
government benefits received by customers or indirectly as a result of a further general
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, this could lead to reduced collections and/or
increased servicing costs for us or on the part of our DCA partners, which may lead to higher
commission rates for collecting on accounts, and reduce portfolio returns. Such reduced collections
would negatively impact our ERC, while higher costs and lower portfolio returns would impact
our results of operations and cash flows. Our modeling for future collections may be rendered less
reliable if the quantity and identity of customers who may reduce their debt payments, or the
amounts of such reductions, cannot be accurately predicted. As a result, our business, results of
operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Further, we may seek to recover on customer accounts that may become subject to

insolvency procedures under applicable laws and also may purchase customer accounts that are
currently subject to insolvency proceedings. Various economic trends and potential changes to
existing legislation may contribute to an increase in the number of consumers subject to personal
insolvency procedures. Under some insolvency procedures, a person’s assets may be sold to repay
creditors and, in the event that our account is unsecured, then we may be unable to collect on such
customer accounts. The ability to successfully collect on our portfolios may decline with an
increase in personal insolvency procedures or a change in insolvency laws, regulations, practices
or procedures.

In particular, in the UK, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 made provision

for a new adjudicator (this role to be undertaken by an employee of the Insolvency Service) rather
than the courts to consider debtor petition applications for bankruptcy. This replaced the previous
court-based procedure with an administrative process. This service started in April 2016 and is
provided on a “digital-by-default” basis. An increased ease of access to bankruptcy procedure,
without the need to go before a judge, might encourage more customers to take this route, which
would have a corresponding reduction in our ability to collect affected debts.

In addition, pursuant to the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental

Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020, customers resident in England
or Wales may apply for a moratorium of up to 60 days in certain circumstances (broadly speaking,
where they are unable to pay their debts as they fall due and are seeking professional advice with
a view to finding an appropriate debt solution). Customers may apply for a separate, longer
moratorium if they are receiving mental health crisis treatment (lasting as long as the treatment
period plus 30 days). In either case, if a customer’s application for a moratorium is successful, our


-----

ability to collect on the relevant account may be limited during the relevant period as (unless the
relevant debt falls into certain excluded types of debt) we would be unable to take enforcement
action or require a customer to pay any interest, fees, penalties and charges that would otherwise
accrue during the period.

Furthermore, we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of the Fund and future funds, purchase

a broad range of non-performing and non-core portfolios that contain a range of assets, including
but not limited to unsecured consumer debt, secured consumer debt, other secured debt, real-estate
assets and commercial assets. In the event that there are changes affecting the realization of these
assets, for example due to changes in real-estate prices, then the collections expected on the
portfolio may be lower than our own projections when we purchased such portfolios and our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Uneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities_**
**_we would like to, and may result in us experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results._**

Debt and other types of portfolios do not become available for purchase on a consistent

basis during the year. Accordingly, there may be times when a number of portfolios, or particularly
large portfolios, become available for purchase concurrently, which may prevent us or the Fund
Manager on behalf of the Fund or future funds, from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities.

The inconsistency in the availability of portfolios for purchase may mean that during

certain financial reporting periods we may make few or no purchases of portfolios. This is
exacerbated with the development of the Fund and Investment Management business since our
Balance Sheet business typically only acquires a 25% interest in the portfolio. In addition, large
purchases at the end of a financial period would likely have a material and adverse effect on our
reported financial ratios. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality.”_

In addition, there are several reasons why the cash flows generated from portfolios may be

uneven. As we purchase a broad range of portfolios, some of which may comprise a portion or
entirely of real-estate assets, then the collection on such portfolios may be realized only when the
asset is sold. In some circumstances, the collection will be maximized by incurring capital
expenditure before sale and therefore, the time to realize a collection can be uncertain.
Furthermore, we, and the Fund Manager on behalf of the Fund and future funds, acquire and may
acquire portfolios with an uneven collections profile. For example, we have acquired a portfolio,
which represents a minority interest in a lending business in the Netherlands, where the final
collection represents the disposal of the underlying business and, as such, generates an uneven
cash flow profile.

Also, there can be a gap between the time of acquisition of a portfolio and the time that we

begin earning collections and/or returns on the acquired portfolio, as we may need to locate
customers, build a consolidated profile of each such customer’s circumstances, incur capital
expenditure on real-estate assets and/or formulate an appropriate repayment solution or collection
strategy before we can start to collect on an acquired portfolio. As a result, we may experience
uneven cash flows and delays in generating income from purchased loan portfolios. For example,
if we were to acquire a material portfolio at the end of a reporting period then this would increase


-----

Net Debt or reduce our cash on hand without generating cash or contributing to Adjusted EBITDA
for the relevant period. See “—We may not be able to procure sufficient funding to purchase
_further portfolios as they become available on acceptable terms or at all.”_

**_Errors in our collection process or other operational matters could have a negative effect on our_**
**_business and reputation._**

Our ability to collect debt and realize collections, such as through the disposal of a real
estate asset, according to the correct contractual terms and to treat consumers fairly is critical to
our business and our reputation. Our reputation is fundamental to maintaining our relationships
with current and potential Investment Portfolio Sellers and clients, LP investors, other
stakeholders, such as banks and bondholders, and regulators. The following events, among others,
may have a negative effect on our reputation and/or our financial results: negative media publicity
relating either to us or the wider debt purchase and collection industry, allegations of unethical or
improper behavior by us or our third-party DCAs or other servicers, our inability to collect debt
on an accurate and timely basis, our failure to respect and treat consumers fairly, failures in our
collection and data protection processes, IT platforms, including IT security failure or other
operational issues, failures by our fund managers to meet the obligations due to LP investors,
litigation, regulatory restrictions, investigations, fines or enforcement actions.

The collection of debt involves interpretations of contractual terms that may vary by debt

originator, which may impact the calculation of consumers’ resulting payment obligations and the
collection strategies we employ. The inherent complexity of debt calculation and historical
inaccuracies may result in our failure to choose the appropriate collection strategies and could lead
to incorrect payment calculations in the future.

In addition, our co-investment and strategic partnership arrangements expose us to

reputational and other risks related to the actions of the co-investors and partners, over whom we
have no control.

Any of the foregoing events could result in financial liability or reputational damage, could

jeopardize our relationships with our clients and our ability to establish new client relationships,
impact our ability to raise further funds to support the development of our Fund and Investment
Management business, have a negative impact on a consumer’s willingness to pay a debt owed to
us or to our clients, diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty or lead to increased regulation of
the debt purchase and collection industry, each of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Negative attention and news regarding the debt purchase and collection industry and individual_**
**_debt purchasers or collectors, including us and our Fund and Investment Management and_**
**_Asset Management and Servicing businesses, may have a negative impact on a customer’s_**
**_willingness to pay a debt owed to us and may diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty for_**
**_Investment Portfolio Sellers and other third parties._**

Negative publicity about us, our industry or other industry participants could cause

consumers to be more reluctant to pay their debts in full or at all, or more willing to pursue legal
actions against us (including through claims management companies or other similar third-party


-----

agencies), even if such actions are not warranted. Publicity could originate from any of the
following:

    - online, print and broadcast media may publish, from time to time, stories about the debt

collection or debt purchasing industry that may cite specific examples of real or
perceived abusive collection practices as well as regulatory investigations and
enforcement actions. Online articles, blogs and tweets, in particular, can lead to the
rapid dissemination of a story and increase the exposure to negative publicity about the
debt purchase and debt collection industry in general or in relation to us in particular,
including in relation to our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management
and Servicing businesses;

    - the internet has websites where consumers list their concerns about the activities of

debt collectors and seek online guidance from others on how to react to collection
efforts mostly in the UK. These websites provide consumers with legal forms and other
strategies to frustrate collection efforts and to try to avoid their obligations. To the
extent that these forms and strategies are based upon erroneous legal information, the
cost of collections may increase; and

    - consumer “blog” sites and claims management companies are common in certain

jurisdictions that we operate and add to the negative attention given to the debt purchase
and debt collection industry. Certain of these organizations may also enable consumers
to negotiate a larger discount on their payments than we would otherwise agree to.

Negative publicity could also result from our being named in published industry complaint

data sites, our receiving negative attention due to internal disputes, including disputes with former
employees, negative publicity in relation to our Fund and Investment Management or Asset
Management and Servicing businesses, or any of our third-party DCA or other service partners
having been alleged to, or having been found to, have violated the law or regulatory requirements
or acted inappropriately in their conduct of business. As consumer awareness continues to increase,
there may be an increase in the level of complaints. Any such negative publicity could jeopardize
our existing relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers or our ability to establish new
relationships with other Investment Portfolio Sellers or impact our ability to raise further funds
from LP investors in support of the development of our Fund and Investment Management
business or diminish our attractiveness as a counterparty generally. Additionally, we are, and may
in the future be, contractually required to reassign portfolios if a portfolio attracts negative media
attention towards an Investment Portfolio Seller. Negative publicity could also result from media
interest in the actions or behavior of any of our directors or senior management. Any of the
foregoing could impact our ability to purchase portfolios, our ability to collect on the portfolios
that we purchase, or our relationships with regulators, Investment Portfolio Sellers, DCAs, other
servicers, our clients, our LP investors, our stakeholders or other market participants, and may
materially adversely affect business, results of operations and financial condition.


-----

**_Our senior management team members and key employees are important to our continued_**
**_success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team or one or more_**
**_of our key employees could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

As part of the Acquisition, we have undertaken certain changes to the Board and senior

management of the Group. The loss of the services of one or more of our key management team
members, including Zachary Lewy (chief executive officer (“CEO”)), John Calvao (Fund
Principal) and Philip Shepherd (chief commercial officer (“CCO”)) or any of our other key
employees, could disrupt our operations. Further, a strategic review is being undertaken, which
may result in further changes to the business, which may include changes to the organizational
structure, the committee structure and / or the governance framework. Following re-registration of
the Target as a private company, there may also be further changes to its organizational framework,
management and governance structure. See “Management.” There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully implement such changes in our management and organizational
structure. Any such changes may also result in the disruption of our business and operations.

Some of the employment agreements that we have in place contain non-compete and

confidentiality provisions that survive termination of employment. However, these agreements do
not and will not assure the continued services of the senior management team members and key
employees and we may not be able to enforce such non-compete and confidentiality provisions.
Senior management team members maintain strong relationships with a number of the largest UK
and European Investment Portfolio Sellers, as well as LP investors. The development of our Fund
and Investment Management business increasingly relies on certain individuals within the Fund
Manager. Further, some key employees possess important undocumented knowledge of our data
analytics and technology systems. If any such employee no longer worked for us, our ability to
maintain, repair or modify our data analytics systems and platforms may be reduced. Our success
depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management team members and
other key employees, and we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals. Further,
we may not be able to continue attracting similarly qualified and skilled individuals to join our
staff and senior management.

In addition, under the UK regulatory Senior Managers and Certification Regime, for

example, certain individuals are required to obtain FCA approval to carry on specified functions
within the UK Regulated Firms (including, for example, the roles of the Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”) and executive and non-executive directors). If a person seeking to perform a senior
management function (as defined in “Regulation and Compliance—Regulatory Framework—
_United Kingdom—Senior Managers and Certification Regime”) is unable to gain approval from,_
or subsequently has his or her approval withdrawn by, the FCA, he or she would be unable to
perform, or continue to perform, the senior management function in question and a suitable
replacement would need to be found and would need to be approved by the FCA for that role. See
“Regulation and Compliance—Regulatory Framework—United Kingdom—Senior Managers and
_Certification Regime.”_

**_Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages could negatively affect our_**
**_business._**

Our financial performance is affected by the cost of labor. As of December 31, 2020, we

had approximately 2,500 full time equivalent employees. An increased demand for our employees
from debt collection competitors or other fund managers could increase costs associated with
employee compensation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Any labor relations disputes or work stoppages and/or strikes could disrupt our operations

and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Dutch employees have established a company works council and, as such, are consulted
regarding certain business decisions that impact employees.

**_A portion of our collections depends on success in individual lawsuits and court processes. In_**
**_pursuing legal collections, we may be unable to obtain accurate and authentic account_**
**_documents for some of the accounts that we purchase._**

A portion of our collections is achieved through litigation. Accordingly, a portion of our

future collections will be dependent on success in individual lawsuits or court actions in the
jurisdictions that we operate. When we commence collection actions through legal proceedings,
courts may require legal agreements, documentation, such as a copy of the account statements or
applications to be attached to the pleadings in order to obtain a judgment against a particular
customer. Where we are unable to produce such legal agreements or account documents when
required to do so, the account may be legally unenforceable and/or the court may not find in our
favor. Furthermore, if any of the legal agreements or account documents possessed by us were
found to be inaccurate, non-authentic or legally unenforceable, courts may deny, or reduce the
value of, our claims. We typically rely on Investment Portfolio Sellers to provide account
documentation, including notices and correspondence with accountholders, to us in an accurate
and timely fashion. We may also rely on DCAs to store key information and documentation, which
is especially relevant when complaints are escalated, and for the purpose of legal action further
along the collections cycle. Our inability to obtain these documents from the Investment Portfolio
Sellers, or our own errors in producing account documents, or DCAs’ failure to adequately store
key information, may negatively impact the liquidation rate on such accounts that are subject to
judicial collections.

In addition, if DCAs fail to respond to communications in a timely manner, or allow any

litigation or judicial process to lapse or become delayed, it may negatively impact the success of a
lawsuit, and have a material adverse effect on our collections.

Any changes to laws, regulations or rules that affect the manner in which we initiate

enforcement proceedings, including rules affecting documentation, or shorter statutes of
limitation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of litigation as a
collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. For example, the Pre-Action Protocol for Debt Claims (“Debt Claims
**Protocol”), which came into effect in the UK on October 1, 2017, has presented practical issues**


-----

for us and the debt collection and debt purchase industry more widely as it limits the circumstances
in which proceedings may be commenced.

Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal proceedings may be affected

by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our possession prior to the
commencement of any collection activities, which could also have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may purchase or service portfolios that contain accounts that are not eligible to be collected,_**
**_including due to defects in customer documentation that may make the customer agreements_**
**_unenforceable._**

In the normal course of our portfolio purchases, and in the management of any Forward

Flow Agreements that we may enter into from time to time, some individual accounts may be
included in the portfolios that fail to conform to the terms of the purchase contracts and we may
seek to return these accounts to the Investment Portfolio Seller for payment or replacement. Such
Investment Portfolio Seller may, however, be unable to meet its obligations to us or we may not
identify non-conforming accounts soon enough, or at all, to qualify for recourse to the Investment
Portfolio Seller. Contracts entered into with Investment Portfolio Sellers have imposed and may
impose restrictions on our ability to return non-conforming accounts by imposing a minimum
threshold value that must be met. Each contract specifies which accounts are eligible for return
and which are not and the time period in which they must be returned to the vendor. Examples of
ineligible accounts could include those that have a foreign address, have been subject to fraud,
those that have an incorrect balance or those where the customer is serving time in prison.
Accounts that would be eligible for recourse if discovered in a timely fashion, but that we do not
discover in time for such recourse, are likely to yield no return.

We may also be unable to enforce on accounts where any underlying debt documentation

is legally defective. For example, the CCA and CONC contain detailed and, in some cases,
prescribed requirements relating to the form, content and execution of regulated credit agreements
as well as the pre-contractual and post-contractual obligations, including disclosure and
documentary requirements (similar obligations are set out in MCOB in respect of regulated
mortgage contracts). Non-compliance with some or all of these requirements may, for example,
render customer agreements unenforceable against the borrower and result in there being no
obligation on the borrower to pay interest and charges during the period of non-compliance, and
may also require interest and charges that have already been collected to be refunded, in addition
to potentially giving rise to regulatory enforcement action.

A technical breach of some of these requirements may render the customer agreement (i.e.,

the underlying credit agreement) unenforceable and require us to undertake a remediation exercise
that may result in balance adjustments and/or cash refunds due on the purchased accounts. In some
cases, such remediation exercises may result in the amounts of compensation exceeding the
purchase price and therefore resulting in total loss of the portfolio value and potentially additional
expenditure on our part. While we carry out appropriate due diligence on each of the proposed
purchases, the internal controls we have in place to detect fraud and errors may fail. The quality
of historical customer documentation may not allow, in each case, the discovery of past breaches
relating to form and content requirements which would impair our ability to correctly assess the


-----

value of the portfolio, resulting in the risk of loss or reduction in the particular purchased
portfolio’s value.

As our business relies on our ability to enforce the contracts underlying our owned

customer accounts, a contract found to be invalid or unenforceable could hinder our ability to
recover from purchased accounts. If we purchase portfolios containing too many accounts that do
not conform to the terms of the purchase contracts or contain accounts that are otherwise
uncollectable or unenforceable, we may be unable to recover a sufficient amount, or anything at
all, and such a portfolio purchase could be unprofitable. Additionally, we may be unable to
ascertain whether the Investment Portfolio Seller has been in compliance in connection with the
underlying accounts at a sufficiently early stage. This could lead to adverse accounting and
financial consequences, such as the need to make substantial provisions against the acquired assets
or to write down acquired assets.

We may not be able to collect on a portfolio to which someone else held legal ownership

or would need to spend time and resources establishing our own legal ownership of the portfolio
if such ownership was unclear. If we are unable to provide appropriate and valid documentation
to confirm our ownership of real-estate or there are additional claims on the real-estate asset, then
the collection expected from the disposal of the asset may be delayed or reduced against our
expectation. Similarly, if we are unable to produce account documents (which under our different
purchase agreements may remain in the custody of the vendor unless requested by us) and account
statements in response to a customer’s request, that account could be legally unenforceable until
such time when these documents are produced. Furthermore, if any of the account documents we
do have were found to be legally unenforceable, courts may deny our claims. Moreover, in
instances where underlying documentation does not prove the existence, ownership or
enforceability of an account, or where an account balance is incorrect, we may not always have
the right to transfer such accounts back to the Investment Portfolio Seller. Additionally, in such
instances, we may be contractually required to repurchase accounts that we have subsequently sold
to third parties.

Any changes to laws, regulations or rules or vendor approach in relation to customer

treatment that affect the manner in which we initiate enforcement proceedings, including rules
affecting documentation, could result in increased administration costs or limit the availability of
litigation as a collection tool, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. Additionally, our ability to collect by means other than legal proceedings
may be impacted by laws that require that certain types of account documentation be in our
possession prior to the institution of any collection activities.

Further, the collectability of certain types of debt may be diminished by subsequent judicial

actions. For example, two Dutch Supreme Court rulings (in 2014 and 2016) regarding the
enforceability of certain types of consumer debt owed to telecommunication providers in the
Netherlands, including certain portfolios purchased by the Vesting Group, have led to portions of
such debts becoming uncollectable. The value of such portfolios run the risk of impairment,
although the significance of such impairment depends also on the quality of the portfolios, and
there may related tax effects. As a result, collecting currently outstanding claims of this type
became more complicated, time-consuming and costly. At this point in time, the lack of a uniform
approach to enforcement in the court system makes it difficult to provide clarity regarding the


-----

actual impact on the value of the portfolios affected by the rulings. Although we have an indemnity
from the sellers of the Vesting Group, and it is possible that we may be able to claim damages
from the Investment Portfolio Sellers of the affected portfolios directly on the basis of a contractual
undertaking, we may not be able to collect on such indemnities and undertakings in full or at all,
and may incur costs in pursuing such claims.

As would be the case for purchased portfolios, we may also be prohibited from collecting

in whole or in part on, or become subject to regulatory intervention, litigation and fines in respect
of, portfolios owned by third parties for which we render asset management or other services. For
example, the AFM conducted an industry-wide thematic review of providers and intermediaries
of consumer credit in relation to Dutch consumers who had taken out relatively high interest
products and then found themselves unable to refinance those products due to tightening lending
criteria across the consumer credit market. The Vesting Group acts as a servicer for certain
portfolios and following the thematic AFM review, the AFM requested certain modifications to a
serviced portfolio which may decreases its value. Notwithstanding the AFM requirements and the
Vesting Group’s regulatory obligations, the owners of this portfolio (who are not subject to AFM
jurisdiction, as the Vesting Group entities are) have objected to some of these modifications and
may pursue legal action against the Vesting Group, for implementing the AFM’s requirements.
We believe we would have meritorious defenses, if any legal action was pursued, and would
vigorously defend against, any such legal action were it brought.

Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations

and financial condition.

**_Limitations and requirements imposed by Investment Portfolio Sellers of portfolios on us may_**
**_hinder our operational flexibility._**

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from purchasing portfolios from Investment

Portfolio Sellers, particularly debt originators. Contracts entered into with Investment Portfolio
Sellers have imposed and may continue to impose various restrictions on our realization of value
from the portfolios, including restrictions on our ability to assign accounts or resell portfolios or
use particular DCAs. Investment Portfolio Sellers may also restrict our flexibility in pursuing
certain enforcement and collection activities, and may have rights to repurchase portfolios if
procedures used by or on our behalf are deemed inappropriate or excessive. In addition, Investment
Portfolio Sellers may have the right to compel us to undertake or refrain from taking certain
actions, including in respect of litigation claims that relate to the Existing Portfolios. Further,
Investment Portfolio Sellers may have rights to repurchase portfolios and require reassignment to
protect against factors such as reputational risk, or in instances where accounts are fraud-sensitive,
or where an accountholder has raised a complaint against the Investment Portfolio Seller with the
FOS, among other things. We are subject to audits conducted by Investment Portfolio Sellers and
clients that place debt with us for collection on a contingent basis, and we may be required to
implement specific changes to our policies and practices as a result of adverse findings by such
Investment Portfolio Sellers as a part of this audit process, or certain Investment Portfolio Sellers
may remove us from their panels of preferred purchasers. Investment Portfolio Sellers may also
have rights under such agreements which are triggered upon a direct or indirect change of control
of a member of us. Any of the foregoing may adversely impact the profitability of portfolios that


-----

we purchased and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**_Examinations and challenges by tax authorities, or changes in tax laws or regulations, or the_**
**_application thereof, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case

law, with certain tax positions taken by us based on industry practice, tax advice and drawing
similarities from our facts and circumstances to those in case law. These positions may relate to
such matters as tax compliance, sales and use value-added tax, permanent establishment, transfer
pricing, deductibility of expenses, classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax,
franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues. Furthermore, the development
of the Fund and Investment Management business has increased the activities and number of tax
jurisdictions that we operate in. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views
taken by us. We are subject to periodic tax audits by the tax authorities and any challenges made
by tax authorities to our application of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount
of taxable income or deductions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor,
they could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, as a result of the impairment of ERC during the first half of 2020 and as

reflected in our results for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Group incurred certain tax losses
within the UK. If we are unable to generate profits in the future, then we will be unable to set-off
these losses. Further, the anti-avoidance provision (Section 673 of Corporation Tax Act of 2010)
states that any losses can be forfeited if within a period of five years of such loss, there is a change
in the ownership of a company and a major change in the nature of conduct of the trade of that
company. As a result, there is a risk that we may be unable to set-off some or all of our losses
sustained during 2020.

Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in UK or overseas tax laws or the

interpretation of UK or overseas tax laws, including those tax laws relating to the utilization of tax
loss or credit carry forwards, and changes in our assessment of certain matters. Our effective tax
rate in any given financial year reflects a variety of factors, including the mix of profit generated
in each jurisdiction, that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. One factor
affecting our effective tax rate is the relevant standard rate of corporation tax in the various
jurisdictions that we operate in, which is subject to change. For instance, at the March 2021 United
Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for
the year commencing April 1, 2023, and set the rate at 25% which was approved with the passing
into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021. Any increase in our effective tax rate in future
periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We are subject to ongoing risks of litigation under consumer credit, collections and other laws._**

We may be adversely affected by judgments, settlements, unanticipated costs or other

effects of legal and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future,
or from investigations by authorities, regulatory bodies or administrative agencies. For example,


-----

there has been a substantial increase in the UK in consumer claims being brought through the
courts and before the FOS in attempts to claim refunds of sums paid under loan agreements or to
avoid making payments going forward. This litigation has increased, and may increase further,
due to the number and level of activity of claims management companies that advertise for
potential claimants and then help them to bring claims in the hope and expectation that they will
be paid a portion of any debt written off.

Claims could also be brought in relation to other areas of alleged non-compliance with

regulation or in relation to minor technical breaches of form and content requirements, which could
affect a large portfolio of agreements. Breaches may have occurred prior to our acquisitions of
portfolios and extends across all the jurisdictions that we operate in, which could result in
regulatory penalties and costs associated with providing redress to customers affected.

In addition, any publicity relating to breaches by our competitors could result in an

increased number of customer complaints, FOS or court claims (including group claims and claims
management companies’ activity) and, more generally, alter customers’ behavior in making
repayments. The focus and awareness on the consumer credit and consumer mortgage servicing
sectors and for example the highly publicized work being undertaken by the FCA may result in
more cases of alleged non-compliance and more customer complaints as customers become more
aware of potential instances of malpractice.

We may in the future be named as defendants in litigation or administrative proceedings,

including under consumer credit, tax, collections, employment, competition and other laws or
government audits and proceedings. Such claims against us, including bulk litigation, regardless
of merit, could lead to costly litigation and divert management personnel from their regular
responsibilities. Furthermore, if such claims are adversely determined against us, we could be
forced to suspend certain collection efforts or pay damages, be subject to enforcement orders or
have our registration with a particular regulator revoked, and our reputation, our business, results
of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, claims
management companies and consumer rights groups could increase their focus on the debt
collection industry and, in particular, the collection of debts owed under regulated agreements.
Such negative publicity or attention could result in increased litigation against us, including class
action suits.

In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in consumers’ propensity to bring

claims related to debt collection to the courts in their attempts to claim refunds of sums paid under
consumer credit agreements or to avoid making payments going forward. This litigation has been
fueled by a substantial rise in claims management companies that aggressively advertise for
potential claimants and then bring claims in the hope and expectation that they will be paid a
portion of any debt written off. Substantial complaint volumes have been made in the UK in
relation to premiums for mis-sold payment protection insurance (which can form part of the debt
being collected) and other types of charges added onto credit accounts. Claims could also be
brought in relation to other areas of alleged noncompliance, which could affect a large portfolio of
agreements. We may in the future be named as defendants in litigation, including under consumer
credit, collections and other laws. We may also have disagreements or disputes with sellers from
which we purchase debt, parties to which we outsource accounts, business partners who collect
claims on our behalf or other counterparties. For example, certain law firm parties with whom we


-----

contract for collection services have asserted claims against us relating to our agreed fee structure
and, in connection with the winding down of similar relationships with other business partners, we
may face additional claims. Such claims against us, complaints, disputes or disagreements,
regardless of merit, could result in or subject us to costly litigation and divert our management
personnel from their regular responsibilities. Furthermore, if such claims are adversely determined
against us, we could be forced to suspend certain collection efforts or pay damages, and our
reputation, financial condition, financial returns and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

**_We may be held liable for the acts of third parties if we fail to develop, implement, monitor and_**
**_enforce our own risk and compliance policies. We may be held liable for the acts of third parties,_**
**_including DCAs, if we fail to implement and maintain sufficient oversight arrangements._**

We continually review our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to

do so in the future. Although we believe that our risk management procedures are adequate, many
of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon observed historical market
behavior and statistic-based historical models. As a result, these methods may not accurately
predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate.
Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, debt
originators, DCAs, consumers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible
to us. We rely on intermediaries, such as DCAs, servicers and external valuers and other thirdparty outsource providers, particularly in areas such as IT and the Fund and Investment
Management business, and we may be held liable for the acts of intermediaries if we cannot
demonstrate that we have adequate procedures in place to prevent acts of non-compliance with
regulations to which we are subject, such as with respect to bribery. For example, Investment
Portfolio Sellers typically require us to assume responsibility for the acts of our third-party
intermediaries in relation to compliance with consumer protection regulation. Further, the
procedures we have in place to monitor and prevent employee misconduct may be insufficient (for
example, to detect or prevent employee fraud). Failure (or the perception that we have failed) to
develop, implement, monitor and, when necessary, pre-emptively upgrade our risk management
policies and procedures could give rise to reputational issues for both us and any associated
Investment Portfolio Sellers, and may result in breaches of regulatory or contractual obligations
by us, for which we may incur substantial losses and face removal from Investment Portfolio
Sellers’ purchasing panels. Failure or perceived failure to develop, implement, monitor and
maintain sufficient oversight arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our prospects,
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The failure of our confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary processes and systems_**
**_could materially adversely affect our business._**

We rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how, continuing technological innovation, and

other trade secrets, to develop and maintain our competitive position. The development of our
Fund and Investment Management business with the establishment of the Fund Manager and the
inaugural fund raise of the Fund, which is not replicated by our competitors, provides demonstrable
evidence of the value of this intellectual property. Certain employees possess valuable trade secrets
about our analytical models, customer databases, business processes and fund manager
infrastructure, and the risk of disclosure of such proprietary know-how could be heightened if any


-----

such employee ceased to work for us. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements
with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary know-how, there can be no assurance
that:

    - these confidentiality agreements will not be breached or will be of sufficient duration;

    - such agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary

know-how; or

    - adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure

of these trade secrets and proprietary know-how.

In addition, others may obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent

development or other access by legal means or illegal means, such as through a cyber-attack. See
“—Our operations are highly dependent upon access to, and the functioning and security of, IT
_applications, systems and infrastructure. A cyber-attack within the business or through the supply_
_chain that impacts systems, processes, or data, compromising the confidentiality, integrity or_
_availability could result in financial losses, regulatory sanctions, and reputational damage.”_

We have in the past initiated, and may in the future initiate, lawsuits to enforce

confidentiality agreements and the ownership of our intellectual property. Initiating litigation
relating to intellectual property rights is costly and may divert technical and management personnel
from their day-to-day responsibilities. In many cases it may not be possible to initiate a lawsuit
prior to the disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, at which point the damage to
our competitive position may be severe or irreparable. Furthermore, we may not be successful in
any such litigation or proceeding. A determination in a proceeding that results in a finding of noninfringement or non-violation by others to our intellectual property or confidentiality agreements
may result in the use by competitors of our technologies, processes or the development of
competing fund management activities, which may materially adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We use a number of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial_**
**_statements, which could prove to be incorrect or cause our earnings to fluctuate._**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make

judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based
on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by management to be
reasonable under the circumstances at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis
of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from
other sources.

Areas requiring more complex judgements may shift over time, based on changes in

accounting policies or on changes in our business profile. More complex judgements are required
in relation to revenue recognition, including impairment gains/losses and fair value through profit
or loss (“FVTPL”) changes on our purchased loan portfolios and judgements relating to cash flow
forecasts. For example, the estimates used in the effective interest rate (“EIR”) and FVTPL


-----

methods of revenue recognition to calculate the projected Gross IRR on our loan portfolios are
primarily based on forecast cash collections and/or valuations. If actual future cash collections are
materially different in amount or timing than the ERC, our earnings could be affected, either
positively or negatively. Higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than
projected will have a favorable impact on revenue in the form of yield increases, impairment
reversals and/or FVTPL gains. In addition, higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur
sooner than projected will have the effect of reducing the expected future value of our loan
portfolios, requiring us to purchase additional loan portfolios in order to maintain our level of
expected future cash flows, which we might not be able to do. Lower collection amounts or cash
collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in
impairments and/or FVTPL losses on our loan portfolios. Impairments and FVTPL cause reduced
and fluctuating earnings. In the future, the areas requiring more complex judgement will change
as a result of the development of our Fund and Investment Management business, for example
concerning the revenue recognition of performance fees.

In the future, should actual results differ from management’s estimates and assumptions

(particularly with respect to revenue recognition and cash flow forecasts), this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Forward Flow Agreements may contractually require us to purchase portfolios at a higher price_**
**_than desired._**

We occasionally employ the use of Forward Flow Agreements (which involve the purchase

of portfolios based upon a contract that requires the purchase of multiple portfolios from an
Investment Portfolio Seller at a fixed price). Depending upon the length of the contractual
arrangements, Forward Flow Agreements typically contain termination clauses that allow the
arrangement to be terminated only in certain limited circumstances. We may be required to
purchase debt under a Forward Flow Agreement for an amount higher than we would otherwise
agree at the time of purchase, which could result in reduced returns. In a more competitive
environment for the sale and purchase of debt, we could be faced with a decision to either decrease
our purchasing volume or agree to Forward Flow Agreements at increased prices or with fewer
contractual protections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. We generally contemplate future fluctuations in the value of the debt that we purchase
through Forward Flow Agreements, but such fluctuations in value may exceed expectations. If the
quality of debt purchased varies from our pricing assumptions, we may price the contract
improperly, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates._**

We report our financial results in pounds sterling, but receive part of our income in euros

as the result of our activities in Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, together with the
income from fund management and performance fees. The revenues and costs for our businesses
whose functional currency is euros, which includes the Fund Manager, are translated into pounds
sterling at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements, thus exposing us
to currency translation risk. It is our policy to not hedge this translation exposure. Consequently,
any change in the exchange rate between the euro and sterling will affect our financial statements.


-----

We are also exposed to currency risk, due to our exposure to euro-denominated loan

portfolios, some of which are held within UK entities, whose functional currency is pounds
sterling. It is our policy to predominantly hedge this exposure, but, to the extent that these
exposures are not hedged, the exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

As we increase our investments to euro-denominated portfolios and with the development

of our Fund and Investment Management business that receives euro fee income, the related
currency translation risks are expected to increase and, to the extent we rely on our revenue in
pounds sterling to service our euro-denominated indebtedness or vice versa, changes in the value
of pounds sterling relative to the euro may increase the proportion of revenue we need to devote
to our debt service obligations and adversely affect our financial results. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and_
_Quantitative Disclosure of Market Risk—Foreign currency risk—Foreign currency sensitivity_
_analysis.”_

To the extent that we purchase portfolios in other jurisdictions, it would be subject to

similar currency translation risk between the currency of such jurisdiction and pounds sterling.

**_Derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses._**

We enter into certain derivative transactions, such as foreign exchange contracts and

interest rate contracts, to hedge against certain financial risks. To the extent that we hedge our
exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency
exchange rates were to change in our favor. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial
instruments that are not cash flow hedges are reported in income, and accordingly could materially
adversely affect our reported income in any period. Hedging activities also involve the risk of an
imperfect correlation between the hedging instrument and the asset being hedged, which could
result in losses on both the hedging transaction and the instrument being hedged. Use of hedging
activities may not prevent significant losses. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk that our
counterparty in a derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations as a result of becoming
subject to an insolvency procedure. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, we may
experience losses that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**Risks Relating to the Transactions**

**_Bidco has made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to_**
**_be materially inaccurate._**

Bidco has made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies

and associated costs of the Acquisition. These assumptions are based on information made
available by the Group, which Bidco believes to be reasonable. However, these assumptions and
forecasts may prove to be inaccurate, and Bidco may suffer from, among others, a failure to realize
the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs,
costs related to unknown liabilities, and including estimated cost savings within the anticipated
timelines or at all, a deterioration of business due to general economic and business conditions. In


-----

addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect actual results in future periods whether or not
these assumptions otherwise prove to be correct. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the
Acquisition and could cause actual results to differ from the assumptions and forecasts set forth in
this Offering Memorandum.

**_The Target Group may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

The Target Group was acquired on October 11, 2021 by way of a scheme of arrangement

effected under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. As a result, the shareholders conducted
limited diligence in connection with the Acquisition. As such, due to the limited scope of the
diligence conducted, there may be liabilities that were not discovered in the course of the due
diligence investigations into the Target Group in connection with the Acquisition. For example,
we could become liable for overdue payables of the Target Group to employees that are not
currently known to us, or could become subject to tax or pension liabilities in respect of historical
periods that we are not currently aware of or the amount of which we may have underestimated.
There can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken by us has revealed or highlighted all
relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Acquisition. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise
or that such information was accurate and remained accurate through the conclusion of the due
diligence exercise. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence
investigation failed to identify material information regarding the Acquisition, we may later be
forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the
Target Group or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, if the materialization of certain
risks, which may or may not have been identified during due diligence, occur, such materialization
may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and, potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory
liability to various parties. Any such undiscovered liabilities, individually or in the aggregate,
could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations
of the Target Group. Also, additional information about the Target Group may be discovered that
may have adverse effects, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to
compliance with applicable laws.

**_Certain of the Group’s contracts contain change of control provisions, which may allow_**
**_counterparties to terminate such contracts under circumstances such as the Acquisition._**

Certain of our contracts, including customer and supplier contracts, contain “change of

control” provisions that may require us to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control,
or contain language that would allow, or could be interpreted as allowing, the counterparty to
terminate the contract under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that any such
counterparty will not seek to exercise their termination rights in the future. In addition, some of
our customer and supplier contracts can be terminated at the convenience of customers and
suppliers, and some customers could choose to terminate such contracts as a result of the
Acquisition and the consequent change in control of the Group. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations following the
Acquisition.


-----

**_We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted annualized data_**
**_and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS._**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain non-IFRS measures, including

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted
EBITDA. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data)
included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and
have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted
accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards.
These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under
IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance.
The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on
available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the
circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a
wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our
actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information
(including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to
comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC
and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the
SEC. Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed
or verified by any independent accounting firm.

In particular, Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA

and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust our financial results to give effect to certain nonrecurring items, the effect of contract wins prior to June 30, 2021 (including the contract with
Tesco Bank that was concluded in third quarter of 2021) and increases in revenues from
management fees generated by the Fund for investments which have already been committed. The
adjustments made to calculate Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted
EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in
the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. Runrate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA are not comparable to the
audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.

In addition, Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by multiplying our

Run-rate Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021 by two and based on estimated
cost-savings opportunities including those which have been identified by an external consultant in
connection with the Acquisition. Given the run rate estimate of costs savings, it is likely that Pro
Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA will differ from actual results for the period. In particular,
this run rate calculation is based on specific benchmark data and assumptions which may vary
from the cost saving initiatives we ultimately implement. We are still devising detailed bottom-up
plans with respect to the exact amounts, timing and the nature of the cost savings initiatives to be
implemented to realize such cost savings. Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA and
adjustments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated
results of operations for any future period and may not be reflective of the actual results for any
period. Such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified and you should not place


-----

undue reliance thereon or regard such information as a substitute for the audited consolidated
financial data of AGG or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of

Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None
of the adjustments, estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent
auditors and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved
had the events for which we have made the adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as
the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or
financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those presented for a number of
reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

**_This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and_**
**_assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties._**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, targets and assumptions

in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our plans,
strategies, objectives, expectations, performance and leverage targets, estimates, projections and
forecasts, budgets, goals, resources, future projects, business expansion plans, changes in laws
related to business operations, certain estimated cost savings, government policies in different
countries and other factors which anticipate future events. Actual results may differ materially
from the expectations and targets provided (whether express or implied) in any forward-looking
statement, although the Group deems that such information is based on reasonable assumptions.

We reference targets and estimates in this Offering Memorandum based on our business

plan, calculations and/or public information previously disclosed to the market. The targets and
estimates may not be met due to several factors and circumstances, some of which may be beyond
our control. Due to various risks and uncertainties, including with respect to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, actual events or results or the actual performance, operations, financial condition,
liquidity of the Group and the development of the industry in which the Group operates may differ
materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements or projections.
The estimates and targets contained herein are indicative only and should not be construed as
forecasts or an assurance that such targets will be met during the timeframe mentioned herein or
at all.

We have also made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings,

synergies and associated costs of the Acquisition, including with respect to the calculation of RunRate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. These assumptions and
forecasts may prove to be inaccurate, and we may suffer from, among others, a failure to realize
the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs,
costs related to unknown liabilities, and a deterioration of our business due to general economic
and business conditions.

The opinions of the Group are current and do not constitute an assurance of future

performance or events of any kind. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at
all. The Group is under no obligation to review, update, supplement or provide any further


-----

information in respect of any estimate and/or forward-looking statement because of new
information, future events or other factors. Accordingly, prospective investors should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the
statements were made. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for further information.

**Risks relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2021,

after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had thirdparty debt totaling £1,354 million, excluding £17.9 million of lease liabilities. See
“Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the Transactions could have

important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general

adverse economic and industry conditions, including an economic downturn due to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the

payment of interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow
to fund the payment of principal of indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the

competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent

that they are not as highly leveraged; and

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such

borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our

ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our high level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts_**
**_of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured

indebtedness and structurally senior indebtedness. Although the Indenture and the Revolving
Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions will be subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under


-----

certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those
restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Facility Agreement
will not prevent us from incurring obligations that would not constitute indebtedness under those
agreements.

**_A number of our present and future subsidiaries, comprising of our Jersey fund management_**
**_group, will constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the indenture governing the Notes, and_**
**_will, therefore, not be subject to the restrictive covenants._**

The subsidiaries that comprise our Jersey fund management group, consisting of (i) AGG

Capital Management (Holdco) Limited (“ACMH”), (ii) AGG Capital Management Limited
(“ACML” or the “Fund Manager”), which is ACMH’s direct subsidiary and our main fund
management entity, and (iii) the Fund Manager’s subsidiaries, which include, among others,
general partners of the various funds managed by ACML, will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of the Indenture. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 97% of the total
revenue for the Asset Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment businesses, together
with the total collections received by the Balance Sheet business, were received directly by
Restricted Group. The remaining 3% was received by ACML, but indirectly received by Restricted
Group pursuant to recharges for services that certain of the Restricted Subsidiaries provided to
ACML. Additionally, a Restricted Subsidiary, Arrow Global Limited, holds preferred ordinary
shares in ACML, entitling it to all dividends declared and paid by ACML.

Furthermore, we may designate additional Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted

Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. This means that, for so long as, and to
the extent that, such subsidiaries remain Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the restrictive covenants
contained in the indenture governing the Notes will not apply to such subsidiaries, subject to
certain exceptions. Accordingly, Unrestricted Subsidiaries (including our Jersey fund management
group), among other things, may incur unlimited debt and may sell their assets without any
restriction of the use of proceeds therefrom. In addition, the creditors of Unrestricted Subsidiaries
(including our Jersey fund management group) will generally be entitled to payment in full of their
claims from the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries before the Issuer or the Guarantors, or
their creditors, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
See also “Description of the Notes—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”

**_The debt under our Euro Floating Rate Notes and Revolving Facility Agreement will bear_**
**_interest at a floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and_**
**_reducing our cash flow._**

The debt under our Euro Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at floating rates of interest

per annum equal to EURIBOR, adjusted quarterly, plus an applicable margin. The debt under our
Revolving Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to
compounding overnight the Sterling Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England
(“SONIA”) plus a spread adjustment for loans denominated in pounds sterling, EURIBOR for
loans denominated in euro or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for loans
denominated in U.S. dollars, in each case plus an applicable margin. These rates could rise
significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be


-----

available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we
may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements and
that we may be required to satisfy margin calls. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under our Euro Floating Rate Notes and
Revolving Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will

cease to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all
currencies will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when
regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar
floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a
floating rate equal to compounding overnight SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
published by the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time
that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other
alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform
differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on any of our debt linked to such a benchmark.

Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to

EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i)
discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated
benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used
for the benchmark or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of
the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or
publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark,
or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in
which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any
of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or
other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any
affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any
floating rate debt linked to that benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at
floating rates of interest, including the Euro Floating Rate Notes, reducing cash flows otherwise
available for our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and servicing our debt obligations.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated

or administered, is no longer generally representative of the underlying market which EURIBOR
seeks to represent on the Issue Date or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro zone
for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities,
the rate of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will thereafter be determined on an alternative
basis by reference to any successor rate (including any generally accepted adjustment spread)
generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in
respect of euro-denominated securities which originally referenced EURIBOR, as identified by
the Issuer in good faith. However, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to
EURIBOR in the good faith judgement of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an
independent financial advisor, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for


-----

determining the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to
the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the
case may be) to holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes as a result of the replacement of
EURIBOR) on the Euro Floating Rate Notes (and any such alternative basis adopted will in all
cases never be less than 0.0%). This means that interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes would be
determined by the Issuer on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not
contemplated at the time you purchased the Euro Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date.
The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially
subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger
amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes.
The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the
interests of the holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

**_Any impairment of our ability to draw funds under the Revolving Facility Agreement could_**
**_adversely and materially impact our business operations._**

Going forward, our operations will be primarily financed using cash generated in our

operations and funds drawn under the Revolving Facility Agreement. We plan to use the Revolving
Facility Agreement to fund our portfolio purchases and to service working capital needs, and for
various other purposes. Should we lose the ability to access funds under the Revolving Facility
Agreement, we may not be able to make new purchases of debt portfolios, which would negatively
and adversely impact future collections, and consequently future cash flows. If our owned debt
portfolios were to become depleted due to our inability to purchase new debt portfolios, we may
face difficulty in accessing sources of credit, as potential creditors may require security over our
debt portfolios. Further, if we were unable to draw funds under the Revolving Facility Agreement,
we may need to decrease our level of debt portfolio purchases and the size of our owned debt
portfolios would decrease over time. There also can be no assurance that we will have sufficient
cash resources on hand at any given time to meet our expenses or debt servicing requirements.

Our ability to draw under the Revolving Facility Agreement will depend, among other

things, on our ability to meet the financial covenants set out therein, and other required conditions
to drawing could be affected by a number of factors, including events beyond our control. See “—
_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_
_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.” Any inability_
to borrow funds at a time of low levels of cash flow could constrain our ability to purchase
portfolios and/or maintain our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the Revolving Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our

ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem our stock;


-----

    - make investments or other restricted payments;

    - enter into agreements that restrict our Restricted Subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

    - transfer or sell assets;

    - engage in transactions with affiliates;

    - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

    - impair security interests; and

    - merge or consolidate with or into another company.

The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future

operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that
may be in our interest. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications.

For the restrictions that will be included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—

_Certain Covenants.” In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the_
Revolving Facility Agreement. In particular, the Revolving Facility Agreement will require us to
comply with a financial covenant. Our ability to meet this financial covenant can be affected by
events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of any of the
covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions contained in the Revolving Facility Agreement could result
in an event of default under the Revolving Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event
of default under the Revolving Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other
limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of
the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility Agreement,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the
Revolving Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If
our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Facility Agreement, accelerate the
payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries
which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or
in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against
any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our_**
**_ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital,

purchases of new debt portfolios and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success
of our business strategy, the continued predictability of our ERC and on general economic,
financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors


-----

discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to make
payments on our debt also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide
with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as
they come due.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations,

that revenue growth, currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be
realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In
particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate
sufficient cash flows from operations. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our
_Operations—Our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been_
_and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,” “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors_
_Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources.”_

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings

under the Revolving Facility Agreement) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or
to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell assets;

    - breach our Forward Flow Agreements;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before

maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a

timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our
ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and
the Revolving Facility Agreement, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue
any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business,
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we
could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount
of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.


-----

**_Creditors under the Revolving Facility Agreement, any Hedging Agreements (as defined in the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement) and certain operating facilities (if any) will be entitled to be repaid_**
**_with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis

with security interests over Collateral which will also secure our obligations under the Revolving
Facility Agreement. The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional
indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Revolving Facility

Agreement, any Hedging Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and certain
operating facilities (if any) that are secured by assets that also secure obligation under the Notes
and the Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any
enforcement action over any such assets. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

As a result, in the event of any realization or enforcement of the Collateral, you may not

be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the Revolving Facility
Agreement, any Hedging Agreements and certain operating facilities (if any) are greater than the
proceeds realized.

**_Certain of the Collateral will not secure the Notes on the Issue Date._**

On the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain

perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens, certain material limitations pursuant to
applicable laws and the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Notes will only be
secured by (i) a limited recourse English law share charge over all shares held by Midco in the
Parent and a security assignment of intercompany loans owed by the Parent to Midco, and (ii) an
English law debenture granted by each of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer over certain
material assets of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer (together, the “Closing Date
**Collateral”). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any case no**
later than the date that is 120 days after the Re-Registration Date (the “Backstop Date”), subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens,
certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws and the terms of the Transaction Security
Documents, the Notes will also be secured by certain security granted by the Additional
Guarantors, including (1) an English law debenture over certain material assets of the Additional
Guarantors that are incorporated in England and Wales, (2) comparable security for Additional
Guarantors incorporated in Guernsey and Jersey, and (3) with respect to the Additional Guarantors
incorporated in the Netherlands, security over (i) the material bank accounts of such Additional
Guarantors, (ii) intra-Restricted Group receivables, and (iii) shares owned by such Additional
Guarantors in the Issuer or the other Guarantors (the “Post Closing Date Collateral” and together
with the Closing Date Collateral, the “Collateral”)). See “Description of the Notes—Security.”
Furthermore, on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will only be
guaranteed by Parent, Finco and Bidco. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Re-Registration
Date, and in any case, no later than the Backstop Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
the Notes will be guaranteed by the Target and certain material wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Target. The provision of such Guarantees and the granting of Collateral are in each case subject to


-----

the Agreed Security Principles, including the limitation of the Collateral to those assets located in
England and Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Netherlands. There can be no assurance, however,
that we will be successful in procuring such security interests or guarantees within the time periods
specified. Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and the
applicable perfection requirements, the Collateral will also secure borrowings under the Revolving
Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities, if any. In addition, subject to
and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, certain other security interests in the
Collateral may be confirmed, extended and/or granted (as applicable) in accordance with the
covenants described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest.” If we or any Guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency_
proceeding after the Issue Date, any such creation or perfection steps may face a greater risk of
being invalidated than if we had taken such steps at the Issue Date. If any such security interest is
created or perfected after the Issue Date, it may be treated under bankruptcy law (in certain of the
Guarantor jurisdictions) as if it were delivered to secure previously existing debt, which is
materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if the steps were
taken at the time of the Issue Date. To the extent that the grant or perfection of any such security
interest is avoided as a preference, you would lose the benefit of such security interest. The
Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described
under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that will have been_**
**_granted as security for the Notes and the Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient_**
**_to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Notes will be secured by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the

Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. In
addition, there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is
insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect
to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on
the Notes.

The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the

Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among other
things, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the
ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and
manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which
the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the
availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may
not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a
significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the
Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the
Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In addition, the
Collateral will not include all of our assets.

We believe our purchased loan portfolios represent the significant majority of the value of

the Collateral. These assets, in particular, may be subject to significant changes in value due to


-----

economic or regulatory trends. In addition, it may be challenging for you to realize the value of
our purchased loan portfolios as these are financial assets, not physical assets, and represent
liabilities of non-performing consumers. Consumer debt receivables typically decline in value over
time. To realize the value of the Collateral, you may need to rely on third-party collection
resources. If you have to rely on third parties, you may be required to make significant upfront
payments to cover collection expenses. In addition, the institutions from which we purchase
receivables may be unwilling to provide you with the account level documentation you may need
to successfully collect on accounts, which may significantly reduce the realizable value of the
Collateral for you. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we
cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral will be sufficient
to pay our obligations under the Notes.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market

value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the
extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned
by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect
to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect
the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes
to realize or enforce that Collateral. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the
Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the
proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent
not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim
against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge
to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangements governing our creditors’ rights
could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be
no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. Proceeds from
enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must first be applied in
discharging sums owing to certain creditor representatives and the Security Agent as well as
enforcement costs, then satisfaction of obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement, any
Hedging Agreements (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and certain operating facilities
(if any) and thereafter to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture will allow incurrence of certain additional
permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The
incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts available to you
from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted

under the Revolving Facility Agreement and the Indenture and other rights encumber the Collateral
securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security
Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.


-----

**_The Issuer, Midco and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and_**
**_the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Transaction Security Documents will allow the Issuer, Midco and the Guarantors to

remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and
dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. Subject to the Transaction Security
Documents, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture or a continuing
acceleration event under the Revolving Facility Agreement would result therefrom, the Issuer,
Midco and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,

encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first priority security interests
in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are
first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the
ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first
priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization
under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental
measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a
moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies
in respect of the Collateral.

The Collateral includes shares of the Additional Guarantors, certain of which are UK

Regulated Firms. As regulated firms, the Additional Guarantors that are UK Regulated Firms are
subject to the change of control regime under Part XII of FSMA and, accordingly, any enforcement
in respect of the shares of such regulated firms will be subject to change of control approvals,
which may delay or otherwise impair the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on
such shares. Moreover, the security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over the Collateral. For
example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce, or to
preserve and maximize value in connection with the enforcement of, a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on
such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those
assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on a first ranking basis

with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Revolving


-----

Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain operating facilities. The Indenture also permits
the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the
Intercreditor Agreement. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent
will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture
regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal
amount of the then-outstanding Notes and creditors (such holders and creditors together the
“Senior Secured **Creditors”) in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the**
“Senior Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 66.67% of the total Senior Credit
Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting
through their respective creditor representatives) and an instructing group that consists of the
lenders under the Revolving Facility and creditors (such lenders and creditors together the “Super
**Senior Secured Creditors”) in respect of certain hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Credit**
**Participations”) which aggregate more than 66.67% of the total Super Senior Credit Participations**
at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective
creditor representatives). Save as provided below, in the event the Security Agent receives
conflicting instructions in respect of enforcement of the transaction security from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the Security Agent shall
act in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (provided that
such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the relevant security documents). If the Super Senior Secured Creditors have not been fully
repaid within six months of the consultation period specified in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu
thereof) or other enforcement action within three months of the end of the consultation period
specified in the Intercreditor Agreement, or certain insolvency event has occurred and the Security
Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or
other enforcement action at that time, then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given
by the Majority Super Senior Creditors (provided that such instructions are consistent with any
applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents). An
instructing group is entitled to give instructions to take enforcement action prior to the end of the
applicable consultation period without consulting with any creditor representative or hedge
counterparty (provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents) if Collateral has become
enforceable as a result of an insolvency event that has occurred with respect to any relevant Group
company, or the instructing group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in the
instructing group determines in good faith (and notifies the other creditor representatives, the
hedge counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultation and thereby delay
the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce Collateral, or on the realization
proceeds of any enforcement of Collateral, and in such circumstances any instructions are required
to be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Super Senior Secured
Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable) on behalf of which the relevant
instructing group is acting and the Security Agent is required to act in accordance with the
instructions first received. The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with
any instructions that may in its discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur


-----

in complying with those instructions until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.
To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes,
the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with
the amount of indebtedness we incur. The lenders under the Revolving Facility may have interests
that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Transaction Security
Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In
addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any other
Debtor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or any holding company of any Debtor (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such
entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.” Delays in enforcement_
could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have
any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security Documents
or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Transaction Security Documents, except
through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes,
you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of
the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the
event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under

the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly
to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture
will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to
enforce the Transaction Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) will provide instructions to the Security Agent in
respect of the Collateral.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the

Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security
interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow
for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and
certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions
as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered
holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and
other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability
of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of,
securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain
jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of


-----

security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under
the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local
law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and
any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt
and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against
the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure
has not (explicitly) been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions and there is no judicial guidance
as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral
may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security
interest on the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or

bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in
a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.

**_The interests of holders of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the_**
**_Sterling Notes may be inconsistent and the interests of the holders of the Notes and additional_**
**_notes issued under the Indenture from time to time may be inconsistent._**

The Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes will be

issued pursuant to a single Indenture. Under the Indenture, the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro
Floating Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes will be able to vote as a single class with respect to
amendments, waivers or other modifications of the Indenture other than with respect to
amendments, waivers or other modifications that will only affect the relevant series of Notes. The
Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes will bear different
interest rates, have a different call schedule and call protection and have other features that differ.
As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro
Floating Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes could conflict. Subject to certain restrictions, further
series of Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes.”) may be issued under the
Indenture which have different terms in respect of currency, interest rate and certain other matters.
Such Additional Notes will also generally vote as a single class with other series of notes issued
under the Indenture but may have interests that differ from the holders of other series of notes
issued under the Indenture, including the Notes.

**_Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible with existing Notes for U.S._**
**_federal income tax purposes._**

Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the

same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable
series of notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such series of
notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal

_Income Tax Considerations”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as_
part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors


-----

concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of Additional Notes
that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, but which, nevertheless, are not capable of being separately
identified.

In the event that any additional Notes issued after the date hereof and sold pursuant to Rule

144A are not fungible with any notes previously issued under such Indenture for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, such non-fungible additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are
distinguishable from such previously issued notes under such Indenture. Additional Notes sold
pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as the applicable series of notes previously issued
under such Indenture without being fungible with such series of notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income

_Tax Consequences”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of_
this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors concerning
the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of additional Notes that
are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes issued under the Indenture for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately identified.
In the event additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series
previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series,
including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer to BookEntry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series. Such a
restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation
S Global Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers” and “Description of the
_Notes—Additional Notes.”_

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, we would have the option to redeem the Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as defined under

“Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts” become effective that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes or the Guarantees, we may redeem the
Notes of any series in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date
of redemption. We are unable to determine whether any such changes to any tax laws will be
enacted, but if any such changes occur, the Notes will be redeemable at our option.


-----

**_Dutch withholding tax may be due on (deemed) payments of interest under the Notes._**

Dutch withholding tax (at a rate equal to the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate) may

be due on (deemed) payments of interest (including guarantee payments) under the Notes due by
(verschuldigd door) any guarantor or future guarantor incorporated or organized under the laws of
the Netherlands (the “Dutch Guarantors”) (the “(Deemed) Payments”) pursuant to the Dutch
Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021) in the following situations:

     - in case the relevant Dutch Guarantor is related (gelieerd) (within the meaning set

out below) to the entity entitled to such (Deemed) Payments (voordeelgerechtigde)
and such related recipient entity (i) is (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction
(laagbelastende jurisdictie) or (ii) has a permanent establishment in such low tax
jurisdiction to which the interest (or guarantee payment) is allocated (worden
_toegerekend);_

     - in case the related recipient entity is not (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction,

the aforementioned withholding tax nevertheless applies in case (a) such entity is
entitled to the (Deemed) Payments with the main purpose or one of the main
purposes of avoiding withholding tax in the hands of another person or entity and
(b) there is an artificial arrangement or transaction, or a series of artificial
arrangements or transactions. An arrangement or transaction, or series of
arrangements or transactions, shall be regarded as artificial to the extent that it is
not put into place for valid commercial reasons, which reflect economic reality;
and/or

     - in case a related entity is from a Dutch tax perspective regarded the recipient of the

(Deemed) Payments, whereas such related recipient entity is not regarded as the
recipient (gerechtigde) thereof pursuant to the laws of the country in which such
entity is (deemed) resident or pursuant to the laws of which such entity is
established (opgericht).

No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any Note in relation to the

withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax imposed or to be withheld in the Netherlands
pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021. See “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.”_

_Related entities_

Entities (lichamen) are related for purposes of the application of the Dutch Withholding

Tax Act 2021 if (i) the recipient entity (alone or together with other entities forming a cooperating
group) has a qualifying interest in the relevant Dutch Guarantor or if (ii) the relevant Dutch
Guarantor (alone or together with other entities forming a cooperating group) has a qualifying
interest in the recipient entity or if (iii) a third party (alone or together with other entities forming
a cooperating group) has a qualifying interest in both the recipient entity as well as the relevant
Dutch Guarantor. An interest in an entity is considered a ‘qualifying interest’ if directly or
indirectly the influence in the decision making is such that the decisions of an entity and thus its


-----

activities can be determined. In any case, an interest is qualifying if it represents more than 50%
of the statutory voting rights in an entity.

_Low tax jurisdictions_

A jurisdiction qualifies as a low tax jurisdiction for purposes of the Dutch Withholding Tax

Act 2021 if it is listed in an annually updated ministerial decree published by the Dutch government
which includes jurisdictions (i) with a profit tax applying a statutory rate of less than 9% (updated
annually based on an assessment as of October 1 of the preceding year) or (ii) included on the EU
list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in the preceding year.

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain material Collateral and Guarantees may be released, any_**
**_retaken Collateral may be subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal_**
**_income tax consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as defined in

“Description of the Notes”). See “Description of the Notes—IPO Pushdown.” The Indenture will
provide that upon consummation of an IPO Pushdown, among other things, references to the
Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only
to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) from time to time (which may not constitute
all or substantially all of the Parent’s assets). Upon such substitution, each Holding Company (as
defined in “Description of the Notes”) of the IPO Pushdown Entity will be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any security granted by any such Holding Company, and the Guarantees and any Collateral
provided by such entities will therefore be released, which could materially reduce the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, we may elect to, but are under no obligation to,
revoke or otherwise reverse an IPO Pushdown undertaken in contemplation of an IPO Event (as
defined in “Description of the Notes”), or to replace any Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant
thereto, in the event that such IPO Event is not consummated. To the extent that new security
documents in respect of any collateral to be retaken (including a pledge over the shares of the
Issuer) are entered into, such collateral may be subject to new hardening periods. In addition, the
IPO Pushdown may result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
depending upon the specific circumstances of the IPO Pushdown, and may have tax consequences
for U.S. holders (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”), including recognition of gain or loss on such deemed exchange. See “Certain_
_Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_The incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods, i.e. the_**
**_periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests_**
**_may be void or subject to challenge in accordance with the laws applicable in England and_**
**_Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Netherlands if the grantor of the security interest enters into_**
**_an insolvency process._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be

secured by the Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods, as the Indenture permits the
release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including


-----

in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening periods for
these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted
or perfected. At each time, if the grantor of the security interest were to enter into an insolvency
process before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
void or subject to challenge and some or all of the security interests may not be possible to enforce
such security interest. The same rights also apply in connection with the accession of subsidiaries
as additional Guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interests over their respective
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**Risks relating to our structure**

**_The Issuer is a newly formed, wholly owned finance subsidiary that does not have any revenue_**
**_of its own and will depend on cash from operating companies to be able to make payments on_**
**_the Notes._**

The Issuer is a newly formed, wholly owned finance subsidiary of the Parent with no

business operations or significant assets, other than the Notes and the Proceeds Loan. The Issuer
will be dependent upon the cash flow from our operating companies to meet its obligations under
the Notes. The amount of cash available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash
flows of the operating companies in the Group and the ability of those companies to transfer funds
under applicable law. The operating companies in the Group, however, may not be able to, or may
not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance loans, directly or
indirectly, to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. Various
agreements governing the Group’s debt may restrict, and, in some cases, may prevent the ability
of the members of the Group to transfer funds within the Group. In addition, the members of the
Group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_The Volcker Rule may negatively affect the liquidity and the value of the Notes._**

The Issuer may be a “covered fund” as defined under Section 13 of the Bank Holding

Company Act of 1956, as amended (together with the rules, regulations and published guidance
thereunder, as amended, the “Volcker Rule”). The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker
Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act but for the exclusion provided under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7)
thereunder. Because the Issuer and each of the Guarantors relies on Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S.
Investment Company Act for their exclusion from registration thereunder (which limits sales of
the Notes to “qualified purchasers” as such term is defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act),
they will be considered “covered funds” for purposes of the Volcker Rule in the absence of an
exclusion from the definition of “covered fund.” Accordingly, “banking entities” (as defined under
the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited or limited under the
Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer
or any of the Guarantors as a “covered fund,” in the absence of an applicable exemption under the
Volcker Rule. Depending on market conditions, this could significantly and negatively affect the
liquidity and market value of the Notes and the Guarantees.


-----

“Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule to include any equity,

partnership or other similar interest, and the phrase “other similar interest” is further defined to
include, in part, any participation or other interest that entitles the holder of such interest to, among
other things: (a) participate in the selection or removal of management or otherwise (other than as
a creditor exercising remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event and to participate in
the removal of an investment manager for “cause” (as defined therein) or in the selection of a
replacement manager upon an investment manager’s resignation or removal), (b) share in the
income, gains or profits of the “covered fund”, (c) receive underlying assets of the “covered fund”
after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (other than as a creditor exercising
remedies upon an event of default or acceleration event), (d) receive all or a portion of excess
spread (as defined therein), (e) provide under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by
the “covered fund” with respect to the interest can be reduced based on losses arising from the
underlying assets of the “covered fund”, (f) receive income on a pass-through basis from the
“covered fund” or have a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the
underlying assets of the “covered fund”, or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive or be allocated
any of the rights in clauses (a) through (f) above.

On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing

the Volcker Rule released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund
related restrictions. The changes are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the
“covered funds” portion of the Volcker Rule, including by, among other aspects, making
modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” creating certain
new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund,” and making certain clarifications to the
definition of “ownership interest.” The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020.

The Volcker Rule may restrict or discourage the acquisition of Notes and the Guarantees

by “banking entities” and may adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and the Guarantees. Each
purchaser of the Notes must make its own determination as to whether it is a “banking entity”
subject to the Volcker Rule and, if applicable, the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its ability
to purchase or retain any such Notes. Investors in the Notes and the Guarantees are responsible for
analyzing their own regulatory position and any liquidity in connection therewith and on its
portfolio generally, and should consult with their own counsel as to the potential consequences of
the Volcker Rule before making an investment decision. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors, the
Initial Purchasers, the Security Agent, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates makes any
representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes and the Guarantees regarding
the treatment of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors under the Volcker Rule, or to such investor’s
investment in the Notes and the Guarantees on the Issue Date or at any time in the future.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may differ from the interests of the holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

TDR Capital indirectly beneficially owns approximately 90.72% of the outstanding shares

of the Issuer. As a result, TDR Capital is able to control matters requiring shareholder approval,
including the election and removal of our directors, our corporate and management policies,
potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate
transactions. The interests of TDR Capital may differ from yours in material respects. For example,
if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of


-----

TDR Capital, as ultimate majority shareholder, may be in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment,
even though such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. TDR Capital has
no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our
business, if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture will permit us to pay
management fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and
TDR Capital may have an interest in us doing so. See “Certain Relationships And Related Party
_Transactions.”_

Furthermore, TDR Capital and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in

companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly
and indirectly with us, or with which we conduct business. TDR Capital and its affiliates may also
pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those
acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. You should consider that the interests of TDR
Capital and its affiliates may differ from yours in material respects. See “Principal Shareholders”
and “Certain Relationships And Related Party Transactions.”

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of_**
**_control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of

control” of the Parent. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds
available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the
purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Facility
Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual
obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in
an event of default under, or acceleration of, our Revolving Facility and other indebtedness. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness,
even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from members
of the Group to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a
change of control, may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. In addition, under the
terms of the Revolving Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay
an equal amount of debt and cancel the corresponding commitments under our Revolving Facility
Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not
be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change
of control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the
purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness
to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we may require third party financing to make
an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that the Group
would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes
would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the
Revolving Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”


-----

The change of control provision to be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford

you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you,
because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or,
even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture. Except as described
under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions
that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of

control will be deemed not to be a change of control if a defined consolidated leverage ratio does
not exceed a certain level in connection with such event. In the event the Parent is sold to a new
investor, irrespective of whether such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, no
assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and
financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Certain definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or

substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Parent’s and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain debt purchase agreements and portfolios acquired pursuant to debt purchase_**
**_agreements require the consent of the underlying seller in order for us to grant security over_**
**_our interests in them and/or to assign or transfer our interests in them which we may not be able_**
**_to obtain._**

Certain of our debt purchase agreements require the consent from the relevant counterparty

in order to assign, transfer or charge our rights under the relevant debt purchase agreement,
portfolio accounts and receivables.

No security will be granted over those debt purchase agreements, accounts and receivables

which are the subject of such restrictions (the “Relevant Assets”) until such time as consent is
granted. The Agreed Security Principles will provide that where assets are subject to third-party
arrangements which prevent those assets from being granted as security, they will be excluded
from any Collateral, provided that, for material assets, reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to
grant security are used by the relevant company. In an enforcement scenario, these assets will not
be available to be realized and applied towards repayment of the Notes.

Even where the required consent to granting of security has been obtained or where consent

to security is not required, some Relevant Assets may contain a further restriction on the transfer
or assignment to third parties. As a result, to enforce any Collateral, the Security Agent may need
to obtain the consent of the underlying seller prior to any sale of any Relevant Asset. In addition,


-----

the nature of our assets and the complex laws and regulations related to the consumer debt
ownership and collection industry may limit the number of potential purchasers of the assets. See
“—Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Business.”

**_Certain debt purchase agreements contain change of control provisions which require notice to_**
**_be provided to the underlying seller of any change in control of the purchaser or which provide_**
**_either counterpart with the option to terminate the debt purchase agreement upon such a change_**
**_of control._**

In relation to certain debt purchase agreements, we are required to notify the underlying

seller prior to or upon a change in control of us or a relevant company within us. Such change of
control may give rise to the right of the underlying seller to terminate the debt purchase agreement
or the right of the underlying seller to repurchase the assets sold under that debt purchase
agreement. The definition of change of control varies between the relevant debt purchase
agreements.

In an enforcement scenario, where the enforcement process involves a sale of us or relevant

companies within us, the Security Agent is required to notify the underlying seller of a potential
change in control and may have to obtain the underlying seller’s consent prior to such sale. The
Security Agent may then be required to sell the relevant receivables to the underlying seller rather
than any other third-party or the relevant debt purchase agreement may be terminated by the
underlying seller.

**_English, Guernsey, Jersey, Portuguese and Dutch insolvency laws may provide you with less_**
**_protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales,

Guernsey, Jersey, the Netherlands and Portugal. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect
to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English, Guernsey,
Jersey, Dutch or Portuguese insolvency law. English, Guernsey, Jersey, Dutch and Portuguese
insolvency law are not identical to, and insolvency outcomes may vary from, the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more of
the Issuer or Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings or whether English, Guernsey, Jersey,
Portuguese or Dutch insolvency laws would be favorable to your interests.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the initial Guarantors, any future Guarantors,

if any, or any other of the Parent’s subsidiaries were to experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Future Guarantees and
Collateral to be provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this Offering
Memorandum will also be subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or
otherwise. Any enforcement of such Guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency
event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s
jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these
jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas
of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of


-----

governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that
you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the

relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant
Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under
applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available
defenses. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain

defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these
jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or
benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer (or similar), voidable preference (or similar), insolvency
or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no
liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other
obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New
York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any
Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or
otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the
Guarantees.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or

insolvency law and other laws, a court could potentially (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a
Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any
amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, if the court found that:

    - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with an actual desire to prefer one creditor over

another and the Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
Guarantee, incurred with the purpose of putting assets out of reach of or otherwise
prejudicing creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when
the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when
the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Guarantee (and subject, in most cases, to the Guarantee having been granted within the
applicable “hardening period”);


-----

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or

corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity (and
subject, in most cases, to the Guarantee having been granted within the applicable
“hardening period”);

    - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not

to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum

amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our

subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a

Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court
would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was
granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or similar on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will

result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court will apply in determining the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a
possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

If a court were to decide that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or

conveyance or similar and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason,
you may cease to have any claim against the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of
the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee if and to the
extent that it has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee
obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to
be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you
that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_Applicable law and other limitations on the enforceability of the security may adversely affect_**
**_its validity and enforceability._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and of the Guarantors under the Guarantees

will be, subject to the restrictions and limitations detailed herein, secured by the Collateral. The


-----

Collateral may be subject to claims that it should be limited or subordinated in favor of our existing
and future creditors under English, Guernsey, Jersey and Dutch or other applicable law. In
addition, enforcement of the security and/or recourse to the proceeds will be limited to the extent
of the amount that can be secured by the Issuer and the Guarantors without rendering the security
voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. Enforcement of the Collateral against the
Issuer and the Guarantors will be subject to certain defenses available to security providers
generally. These laws and defenses include those that relate to insolvency, voidable preference (or
similar), fraudulent conveyance or transfer (or similar), financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

**_If a bankruptcy petition under U.S. law were filed by or against us, the Issuer or any of the_**
**_Guarantors, holders of the Notes may receive a lesser amount for their claim than they would_**
**_have been entitled to receive under the Indenture._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors

under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the Notes, the claim by any holder of the
Notes for the principal amount of such Notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:

    - the original issue price for the Notes; and

    - that portion of the original issue discount (the “OID”), if any, that does not constitute

unmatured interest for purpose of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any OID that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing may constitute

unmatured interest. Accordingly, holders of the Notes under these circumstances may receive a
lesser amount than they would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Indenture, even if
sufficient funds are available to pay such holders the unamortized portion of any OID as of the
bankruptcy filing.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries and_**
**_Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs._**

At the Issue Date, the Initial Guarantors will guarantee the Notes, and as soon as reasonably

practicable after the Re-Registration Date, and in any case no later than 120 days after the ReRegistration Date, the Additional Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. However, not all members
of the Target Group will guarantee the Notes, and, under various circumstances, the Guarantees
may be released and newly incorporated direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Parent may not be
required to guarantee the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay

amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, the Unrestricted Subsidiaries, including lenders under our
finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the
assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor,
as a direct or indirect shareholder.


-----

In addition, our Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs may and do incur Permitted

Purchase Obligations. Our Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs, which are not consolidated
subsidiaries, will not be Guarantors, and therefore will not have any obligation to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of
such Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets
of such entities before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct
or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary or any Permitted Purchase

Obligations SPV becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound
up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

    - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will

have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary or entity; and

    - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, or creditors of

such Permitted Purchase Obligations SPV, as applicable, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary or entity,
as applicable, before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled
to receive any distributions from such subsidiary or entity.

As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors

(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries and
Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Facility
Agreement will, subject to certain limitations, permit these Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Permitted
Purchase Obligations SPVs to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence
constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The
Indenture and the Revolving Facility Agreement will not contain any limitation on the amount of
other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries
and entities.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes denominated in foreign_**
**_currencies._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros (with respect to the Euro Fixed Rate

Notes and the Euro Floating Rate Notes) and in pound sterling (with respect to the Sterling Notes).
An investment in Notes denominated in a currency other than the currency by reference to which
you measure the return on your investments will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of sterling or the euro, relative to
other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro or pound sterling against other relevant currencies could cause a
decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a
loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you
measure the return on your investments.


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be

released automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of the property or assets constituting

Collateral, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation on sale of
_assets and Subsidiary stock” covenant or other provisions of the Indenture;_

    - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of

the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and share capital, of such
Guarantor;

    - if the Parent designates any Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in “Description of the

_Notes”) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions_
of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and share capital of such subsidiary;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the

Notes, legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture as provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and
“Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and discharge;” or

    - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or

otherwise as contemplated in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically,

including:

    - in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) only,

in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of a Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) or the share capital of
that Guarantor to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the “Limitation on sale of assets and Subsidiary stock”
covenant of the Indenture and the relevant Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantee only, if the Parent designates any Restricted

Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the

Notes, legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture as provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance,” and
“Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and discharge;” or


-----

    - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Guarantees will each be subject to release upon enforcement sale as

contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide that the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, shall not, in an enforcement scenario,
exercise its rights to release the relevant Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral unless
the relevant sale or disposal is made:

    - for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

    - pursuant to a public auction, or a fairness opinion has been obtained from an

internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm selected by the Security
Agent.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of

_the Notes.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through

Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and
Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for
book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of the book-entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of Notes unless and until definitive notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear
and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in

global form will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will be credited to Euroclear
and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Notes in global form
and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
or any other paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records
relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations

for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including
enforcement of security for the Notes and the Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest,
you will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your
instructions and will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot


-----

assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable
you to vote on any requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell

your Notes or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other

things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for
similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading
market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the
Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell
your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to

deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be
or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange being granted, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on
another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may
have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary
market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future, which could

adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Notes.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The

credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit
risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional
risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one


-----

or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.

Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the
applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See “Notice to investors” and
“Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and
sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the

United States, and their business is conducted outside the United States. The majority of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York
courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may
be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the majority of the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because the majority of the assets
of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the majority of the assets of their directors and executive
officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions
of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Service of Process and _Enforcement of_
_Civil Liabilities.”_

**_Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our_**
**_independent auditors._**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports,

including language limiting the independent auditors’ scope of responsibility in relation to their
audit work. Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the
independent auditors.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance

issued by ICAEW, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent
auditors’ reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each state that: the report has
been prepared for the named parties (the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the
Addressees for an opinion from the independent auditors on the truth and fairness of the nonstatutory directors’ reports and financial statements; that the report was designed to meet the agreed
requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; the report should not
therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights
against the independent auditors other than the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; any


-----

party other than the Addressee(s) who obtains access to the report or a copy and chooses to rely
on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk; and to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the independent auditors will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any
other party. In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us that
they do not intend their duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as
investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the Addressees of their reports.

Without in any way, or on any basis, affecting, adding to or extending the independent

auditors’ duties and responsibilities to the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility
being accepted or assumed by or imposed on the independent auditors to any party except the
Addressees, the independent auditors have provided consent to the Issuer’s inclusion,
independently of the independent auditors, of the audit reports with the non-statutory historical
financial statements to which they relate in this Offering Memorandum for a proposed issuance of
Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of the non-statutory directors’ reports and financial
statements for each relevant period has been undertaken for the Addressees. The consent provided
by the independent auditors is different from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the
U.S. Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions involving securities registered under
the U.S. Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, the independent auditors have not filed a consent under Section 7 of the U.S.
Securities Act. The independent auditors’ reports on the historical financial statements as of and
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement

or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court)
were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and purchasers of
the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the non-statutory
directors’ reports and financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to
which independent auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear
under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. The inclusion of the language
referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against
the independent auditors for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.

**_The adoption of the proposed financial transactions tax may impact trading in the Notes._**

In 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common

financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,
Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the participating Member States). However, Estonia has
since stated that it will not participate.

The FTT could, if introduced in the form proposed in 2013, apply to certain dealings in the

Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market
transactions would be exempt and therefore the issuance of Notes in this Offering should be
exempt if the FTT were to be in existence on the Issue Date. Should the FTT be adopted, secondary
market transactions in the Notes could become taxable in certain circumstances, which could
materially adversely affect the liquidity of the Notes and their price in the secondary market.


-----

Under the proposal, the FTT would be a tax primarily on “financial institutions” in relation

to “financial transactions” (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative
contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments). Under the current proposal, the FTT
could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating
Member States. Generally, it could apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party
is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A
financial institution may be, or may be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in
a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings
is issued in a participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States

and may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Additional Member States may decide to participate, although certain Member States have
expressed strong objections to the proposal. It is unclear whether, and if so when and in what form,
an FTT could be imposed. Holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice
in relation to the FTT.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that we will receive gross proceeds of approximately £1,232 million

equivalent) were on-lent to the Target Group to repay and cancel the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and for fees on the Revolving
Facility. See note (3) above. On the Issue Date, the proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay a portion of the Revolving Facility. As a
result, upon completion of the Transactions, including repayment of the Revolving Facility from the proceeds of the Offering, £55 million
will remain outstanding under the Revolving Facility as of the Issue Date (excluding any unamortized debt financing costs).

(9) Represents the aggregate principal amount of each of the Euro Floating Rate Notes, the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Sterling Notes offered
hereby (excluding any unamortized debt issuance costs).

(10) Represents the equity of the Target Group as of June 30, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the implied equity value of the Target, which is

£489 million, an increase of £380 million over the shareholders’ equity of the Target as of June 30, 2021 representing the Equity Contribution
of £565 million in connection with the Acquisition, less uncapitalized transaction expenses estimated at £75 million. The Adjustments for the
Transactions therefore represent the replacement of the Target Group’s equity with the anticipated equity of the Group, less uncapitalized
expenses.

**SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA**

The following tables summarize the Target Group’s historical consolidated financial

information as of the dates and for the periods indicated, which has been derived from the Target
Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020 and as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, and the
related notes, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We have also
presented certain information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, in order to facilitate a
comparison of the Target Group’s results of operations for such periods with other periods
presented. The information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, has been derived by
subtracting the Target Group’s six months ended June 30, 2020, results of operations data from
the Target Group’s results of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2020, and adding
the Target Group’s results of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

The Target Group’s results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of

the results to be expected for any future period. For further information on the basis of presentation
of the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information.”_

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**

**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations_

_covers the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Group. Accordingly,_
_the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial_
_statements of the Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019_
_and December 31, 2020 and as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2021_
_(collectively, the “periods under review”) and related notes, included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and_

_beliefs, and involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those_
_discussed in these statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include,_
_but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

Established in 2005, we are a leading European investor and asset manager of debt in the

non-performing and non-core assets sector, principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the
Netherlands, Italy and the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”). As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8
billion of FUM, £1,028 million in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733
million 120-month ERC, and, in the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free
Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7 million.

We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions

that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “Business—Our businesses” and “—
_Our Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and,_
as such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in
our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below:

1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management_
business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes
the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit
Opportunities (the “Fund”), with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, together
with Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta;

2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms_
service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments,
on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance
Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading
positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with
expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME non-performing loans
(“NPLs”) and non-core asset servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we
operate; and

3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the_
deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way


-----

of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership,
Arrow Global SMA I LP (“Arrow SMA”). Going forward, we expect the Balance
Sheet business to function primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities
alongside the Fund as well as any future funds. We may, however, continue to make
direct investments through this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance
Sheet business also incorporates the financial performance of the back book
portfolio investments made prior to the launch of the Fund.

Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and

Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive
risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these
portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms.

We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and non
core loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional
fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce
their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and
managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing
European market.

Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients,

communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving
fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve
their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and
receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate.

Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing

NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and
diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key
European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having
operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class
provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced
“on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller
transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive
advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of
off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an
auction-like process).

Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio

investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals,
our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive
European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a
high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database
incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten
since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across
multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which


-----

focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and
Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our
financial characteristics. See “—Our Business Model.”

As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model

delivers:

    - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by

our Balance Sheet business;

    - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital
light businesses;

    - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own

balance sheet to provide returns; and

    - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required

for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business.

To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record

and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund
represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit
fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in
Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined
with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to
raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.

**Our Business Model**

As an integrated fund manager, we operate three different business lines, being our Fund

and Investment Management business, our Asset Management and Servicing business and our
Balance Sheet business, with significant synergistic benefits among them. Essentially, the Fund
and Investment Management business originates new investment opportunities that our Balance
Sheet business can co-invest into, thereby creating additional opportunities for our Asset
Management and Servicing business to service such investments.

Each business line has its own financial characteristics. For the six month period ended

June 30, 2021, the revenue mix of the three branches of our business (as a percentage of our total
revenue) was as follows: the Balance Sheet business produced 54% of our total revenue, the Asset
Management and Servicing business contributed to 33% of our total revenue and the Fund and
Investment Management business yielded 13% of our total revenue. The planned shift towards
growing our earnings through increased income generated from our collection of management fees
in the Fund and Investment Management business, together with stable servicing income derived
from the Asset Management and Servicing business and less of a dependency on our Balance Sheet


-----

business – a plan which we refer to as our “capital-light” businesses model – is expected to result
in a change in our business’ revenue mix and the financial characteristics of the Group (as
compared to our historical figures), both of which have historically been weighted more towards
the Balance Sheet business.

As part of this shift, it is our intention to deliver:

    - an increase in FUM coupled with a steady reduction in the level of portfolio

investments held by our Balance Sheet business in the future,

    - an increase in the proportion of revenues and earnings derived from our capital-light

businesses,

    - higher return on capital invested driven by reduced use of our own balance sheet to

provide returns, and

    - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required

for re-investment through our own Balance Sheet business, with a concomitant ability
to reduce leverage.

**_Our business model: Fund and Investment Management business._**

Our Fund and Investment Management business, which comprises ACML, together with

Europa Investimenti, Sagitta and Norfin, generates income by providing services in relation to the
discretionary and semi-discretionary allocation and management of third-party capital. For the six
month period ended June 30, 2021, the Fund and Investment Management business generated an
EBITDA of £7.6 million, equating to 12.4% of the Group’s EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) for
the same period, at an EBITDA Margin of 30.7%.

Typically, income is generated through management fees and in addition, LP investors

incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. Management fees for fund and
investment management services are normally calculated based on a fixed percentage of the value
of assets managed and deducted from customers’ account balances on a regular basis. Income from
fund and investment management services is recognized over time as the services are provided. In
addition to the management and performance fees that we collect, we charge investors “designated
charges,” which enables attributable costs to be re-charged to the Fund and future funds.

In addition, these operations drive revenues for our other businesses in two ways: first,

portfolio purchases by the Fund will be serviced on Arrow platforms, at market-referenced rates,
driving earnings within our Asset Management and Servicing business, with approximately 71%
of portfolios purchased currently being serviced by our platforms; and second, our Balance Sheet
business will typically co-invest alongside the Fund and drive revenue and collections from the
acquired portfolios. Under the Fund, a co-investment of 25% is typical, but we expect this to reduce
over time to 10% as we raise new funds with anticipated lower co-investment levels. Returns from
these co-investments and from servicing on the Arrow platforms are recorded under the Balance
Sheet business and Asset Management and Servicing business results.


-----

Management fees paid for the Fund are predominantly generated on the net asset value of

FUM (although larger LP investors in the Fund were charged discounted management fee rates)
with our target rate being 1.75% and are paid to the Fund Manager. There is also a small charge
on committed capital designed to cover expenses from certain LP investors. Given that the life of
the Fund is eight years (comprised of a three year investment period coupled with a five year
distribution period), with a potential extension to a maximum of ten years, we anticipate that these
management fees will provide relatively steady cash flows on the investments made by the Fund.
As we raise additional funds, we expect these management fees to become a significantly larger
part of our revenue streams, as we seek to increase our FUM and drawn capital and also reduce
the levels of discounts offered, delivering closer to target management fees.

LP investors also incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. Performance

fees are generated based on outperformance over a specified “hurdle” rate, which for the Fund is
7% - 8% Net Deal IRR (to LP investors), after which the Fund Manager, through its ownership of
the general partner, is entitled to a certain percentage of the returns above that level. In respect of
the Fund, returns over the aforementioned 7% - 8% Net Deal IRR will be split generally in line
with an 80:20 ratio between the LP investors (80%) and the general partner (20%). Assuming that
LP investors receive the target 13% Net Deal IRR, we expect to receive a 40% share of the
performance fee or carried interest accruing to the general partner, culminating in an indicative
performance fee in the amount of approximately €50 million, with recognition expected between
2024 and 2026. We also anticipate that the percentage level of carried interest accruing to us will
increase for subsequent future funds.

The Fund and Investment Management business also generates income from the Balance

Sheet business, through an intra-segmental charge. These commercial charges cover portfolio
management services relating to the assets held on our balance sheet at a rate of 150bps on net
asset value of the back-book assets and for Arrow SMA based on a rate of 175bps during 2020
and 150bps from January 1, 2021 on drawn capital during the investment period.

The total blended fee rate for the financial year 2020 for our Fund and Investment

Management business was 0.9% of FUM, partly reflecting the discounts offered to LP investors
in the Fund (some LP investors pay modest fees of up to 25 bps on committed capital) and the
typically lower fees generated by Norfin and Sagitta. We are targeting FUM of approximately €10
billion (over £8.4 billion) and balance sheet debts of less than £1 billion by the end of 2025
(equating to an approximately 70% increase from our FUM of €4.8 billion (representing
approximately £4.1 billion) and £1.3 billion total borrowings as at June 30, 2021) through the
growth of our existing funds and the establishment of new funds. However, there can be no
assurance that we will achieve such target within the estimated time frames or at all. See “Forward_Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This_
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Our business model: Asset Management and Servicing business_**

Our Asset Management and Servicing business, which comprises the servicing platforms

operating in the UK, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland, generates revenues by charging
servicing fees to entities owning assets. Income from contracts with our clients, which will include


-----

our Balance Sheet business and the Fund, are measured based on the consideration specified in a
contract with the client. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation related
to a service we have undertaken to provide to a client.

Servicing income makes up the majority of the income of the Asset Management and

Servicing business, and in itself comprises a broad range of services, including secured and
unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence
activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, master servicing, securitization
vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court
process management and third-party sub-servicer management. In all material cases, the services
are provided at a point in time that corresponds to the satisfaction of the related performance
obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognized as and when
the services are provided to the client, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of
the contract.

Income from our Asset Management and Servicing business remained robust through 2020

at £125.4 million compared with £128.8 million in 2019, demonstrating the resilience of this
capital-light income stream through a significant economic downturn. Further, we have had
resilient third party income growth during the first half of 2021, 12.6% higher than during the first
half of 2020. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins and during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2021, we recorded a further 11 contract wins. Furthermore, on August
17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco
Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced
service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they
will need in the future, with Tesco Bank choosing to partner with us, given our customer focus,
proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The
partnership is expected to result in in our taking on over 200 Tesco Bank personnel on November
1, 2021. We believe we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing
partner for financial institutions which require additional collections capacity with growing NPL
volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, we believe the Asset Management and Servicing business has opportunities

to grow revenues through business created by the Fund. As of June 30, 2021, 71% of the Fund
purchases were being serviced on our platforms. The Fund pays a market referenced fee for such
servicing. As a result, we anticipate that the Asset Management and Servicing business will be in
a strong position for future growth in line with the growth of our Fund and Investment Management
business. For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the EBITDA of the Asset Management
and Servicing business was £6.2 million, equating to 10.1% of the Group’s EBITDA (preAcquisition costs) for the same period, at an EBITDA Margin of 9.7%. We expect that the
profitability for the Asset Management and Servicing business will steadily increase as we
continue to develop our operational efficiency. The Asset Management and Servicing business
EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 12.4% (2019: 17.9%) and the Group
seeks to target a 25% EBITDA Margin from the business by 2025 by way of increased operational
efficiencies, the vertical alignment of our business and the resulting heightened accountability of
the business leaders in the jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that we
will achieve such targets within the targeted time frames or at all. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors—Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum_

_includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve_
_risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Our business model: Balance Sheet business_**

Our Balance Sheet business comprises portfolio investments made with our own capital.

Since the launch of the Fund, our investments typically represent a co-investment alongside Arrow
SMA. Revenue is recognized based on the effective interest rate method. In summary, the returns
represent the cash collections of the portfolio less the initial cost, any upfront costs incurred at the
time of acquisition and all costs associated with collection and servicing activity on the portfolio.
For the six month period ended June 30, 2021, the total income generated by the Balance Sheet
business was £105.1 million while the 84-month ERC and the 120-month ERC for the same period
was £1,572 million and £1,733 million, respectively. We originally operated solely as a balance
sheet investor in UK NPLs and have expanded into a multi-asset class and multi-geographical
investor and, through our sophisticated origination, underwriting, portfolio management and
servicing capabilities, have built a consistent track record of delivering strong returns through the
economic cycle.

We use a number of metrics in our underwriting process, with the key metric being Net

Deal IRR. Revenue from the Balance Sheet business is therefore sensitive to the Net Deal IRR at
underwriting, any under or over performance of collections against the Net Deal IRR at
underwriting and the volume of portfolio investments. The table below shows our track record
since 2010. Net Deal IRR represents actual collections achieved plus expected future collections,
as shown below as at December 31, 2019, December 21, 2020 and June 30, 2021 to demonstrate
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent performance:

The Net Deal IRR for our Balance Sheet business for 2020 and 2021 are 21% and 16%,

respectively. These Net Deal IRR figures take into account certain deals that were undertaken to
support our Asset Management and Servicing business but where the Fund declined to participate.
For reference, the Net Deal IRR for the Fund for 2020 and 2021 are 22% and 18%, respectively
based on the collections and ERC/underwrite cases in the Fund as at June 30, 2021.

We plan to grow our capital-light businesses over the coming years, whereas the intention

is to maintain or potentially reduce the focus on our Balance Sheet business. The Balance Sheet
business typically co-invests alongside the Fund, participating for 25% of acquired portfolios, and
we intend that our participation level will reduce for future funds to 10%, thereby reducing

portfolio investments from our Balance Sheet business. For the six month period ended June 30,
2021, the EBITDA of the Balance Sheet business was £53.9 million (EBITDA for the six month
period ended June 30, 2020: negative £99.4 million), equating to 87.9% of the Group’s EBITDA
(pre-Acquisition costs) for the same period, at an EBITDA Margin of 51.2%.

**_Our business model: Our Structure_**

The illustrative diagram below shows the synergistic interactions among our three business

divisions described above.

_Source: Company information._

Pursuant to the requirements of the LP investors in the Fund, the Fund Manager (or ACML)

and its subsidiaries will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture. There are, however, a
number of arrangements in place to ensure that approximately 100% of the economics generated
by the Fund Manager, including fund management and performance fees, accrue to the Restricted
Group. In summary, these are that:

    - the Fund Manager pays for services provided to it by members of the Group which are

Restricted Subsidiaries. These payments include 100% of designated charges and
certain deal costs, as well as approximately 75% of all the management fees that the
Fund Manager generates (the 75% of management fees is in line with transfer pricing
tax arrangements and reflects the proportion of services that members of the Group
deliver in Jersey as compared to other territories); and

    - Arrow Global Limited holds preferred ordinary shares in the Fund Manager, which

entitles Arrow Global Limited to 100% of all dividends distributed by the Fund
Manager.


-----

As such, although the Fund Manager and its Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries

under the Indenture and therefore not subject to the restrictions under the Indenture, and sit outside
of the Restricted Group of companies, the distributions on the preferred ordinary shares detailed
above and the fees and economics generated by the Fund Manager flow to the Restricted Group
with the Fund Manager only retaining sufficient revenue to cover its costs. By way of illustration,
97% of the collections and revenues (i.e., cash collections plus income from our Asset
Management and Servicing and Fund and Investment Management businesses, together with other
income which amounted to £436 million) earned in 2020 were received directly into the Restricted
Group, while a further 3% was received indirectly by the Restricted Group by way of the
mechanisms detailed above.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Set forth below are certain key factors that historically have affected our results of

operations, and which may impact our results of operations in the future.

**_Macroeconomic conditions_**

Macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate can have various effects on

the level of portfolios offered for sale by Investment Portfolio Sellers, our ability to generate
collections from our portfolios, whether through payments from customers or the realization from
other assets, such as real estate, as well as our ability to develop both our Fund and Investment
Management business through raising further funds from LP investors, and our Asset Management
and Servicing business through winning new service contracts.

Improved economic conditions may have a positive effect on our business. However, a

deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions in the jurisdictions that we operate may lead to
some or all of the following consequences, as well as other matters that we may be unaware of:

(a) an increase in unemployment, inflation or other factors affecting the ability of
customers to repay their debt will reduce the level of collections and reduce returns;

(b) a reduction or weakness in real estate prices may reduce or delay our ability to sell
assets and will also reduce the level of collections and reduce returns;

(c) increase the level of defaults within the market, resulting in an increase in
Investment Portfolio Sellers’ propensity to sell non-performing or non-core assets
leading to lower prices prevailing in the market, thereby increasing the volume and
the returns on loan portfolios available for us or the Fund Manager to purchase;

(d) increase the requirements of third-party service clients for our services, enabling us
to compete for and win asset servicing and management contracts on acceptable
terms;

(e) enhance the returns available for investments in non-performing and non-core
assets, thereby making it more attractive for LP investors to commit capital under
a discretionary mandate to be managed by our Fund Manager; or


-----

(f) impact our ability or the cost of raising funds to support our Balance Sheet business.

While on the one hand a deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions may adversely

affect our business (as detailed above), such deteriorating macroeconomic conditions may, on the
other hand, generate opportunities for our business. The current macroeconomic environment is
dominated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe will increase transaction
activity in late 2021 and beyond, which could in turn create new market opportunities for our
business. See “Significant Factors Affecting Results of OperationsImpact of the COVID-19
_pandemic” and “BusinessOur Key StrengthsAttractive market with strong growth drivers.”_

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan,

China, rapidly spreading to nearly all regions around the world, including the UK and Ireland, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Italy, which caused the World Health Organization to declare COVID19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In order to prevent the spread of the virus, governments around
the world implemented several measures, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandatory
quarantines and self-isolations for infected people, business slowdowns or shutdowns, and
encouraging or requiring people to avoid large gatherings. For example, in response to the COVID19 pandemic, on March 23, 2020, the UK government imposed a nationwide quarantine together
with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures across all the countries in
which we operate, we closed substantially all of our offices and transitioned all of our employees
to remote working. Whilst restrictions have eased at times – for example the nationwide quarantine
in the UK was lifted on May 10, 2020 – significant restrictions and social distancing measures
have remained in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall economies of the countries
in which we operate and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. For instance, court
closures and various legal and regulatory measures intended to help debtors, such as moratoria on
certain collection or enforcement activities, along with a slowdown in the real estate market,
heavily impacted our ability to make collections during this period. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the measures taken to prevent a further spread, our business was impacted globally
in 2020 by the temporary closure and restrictions as a consequence of the guidelines given by the
respective governments of the countries where we operate.

Collections performance is a critical factor for our business and the COVID-19 pandemic

led to disruptions in our cash collection performance, as a result of a deterioration in the
macroeconomic environment, changes to our customers’ financial circumstances and lockdown
measures implemented in the countries in which we operate, resulting in court closures and
impacting the business’s ability to litigate and operate as normal. Our cash collections during the
three months ended March 31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC with the only
material shortfall relating to £10 million of delayed collections from two large secured assets in
Italy and Ireland. However, we started to see the early signs of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic during March 2020 and our collections performance weakened in April 2020 with
secured collections, impacted by lockdown and court closures to 78% of ERC, enhanced by the
acceleration of cash flows from the restructuring of one of the Group’s co-investment portfolios.
During this period, unsecured collections stabilized at 74% of ERC. Excluding the collection
acceleration, cash collections for April 2020 settled at 75% of ERC.


-----

Approximately 34% of the Group’s ERC is derived from secured portfolios – primarily in

Portugal and Italy – where cash collections are often driven either by the local court system or
result from the completion of real estate sales. Whilst both of these collection strategies were
directly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by European governments, secured
portfolios are backed by underlying assets and therefore, the timing of cash collections can be
impacted, together with the quantum in the event of real estate price decreases. The majority of
the remaining 66% of the Group’s ERC consists of unsecured assets – primarily in the UK,
followed by Portugal and the Netherlands – where collections are driven by smaller, more frequent
monthly cash collections. Automated collections form approximately 46% of total Group
collections and approximately 87% of Northern European (the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands)
unsecured collections. Where unsecured collections are not automated, they are substantially all
paid by remote electronic means.

Collections started to recover in May 2020 from the low in April, with secured collections

at 62% of ERC and unsecured at 85% of ERC. Collections during the three months ended March
31, 2020 were £85.0 million, representing 92% of ERC, and during the six months ended June 30,
2020 were £175.7 million, representing 91% of ERC. Our financial response to the collections
weakness was proactive and we strengthened our liquidity position in the first half of 2020
demonstrating our ability to manage liquidity, in particular through the curtailment of investments
in new portfolio acquisitions and the suspension of shareholder dividends. Cash and cash
equivalents improved by £77.0 million to £165.8 million from December 31, 2019 to June 30,
2020 with decisive action on cost and working capital as well as acceleration of collections to
make up for COVID-19 induced collection weakness and reduced portfolio purchases of £42.9
million (six months ended June 30, 2019: £165.6 million). Furthermore, we raised additional funds
in July 2020 through the execution of a €104.7 million asset backed amortizing loan and completed
a long-term support agreement with our bank lenders at that time, recognizing that short term
leverage would increase above previous covenant levels as the impact of lower collections built
over the following twelve months. As a result of our cautious view on the macroeconomic
environment at that time, we reforecast our ERC at June 30, 2020, resulting in a non-cash write
down to portfolio investments on the balance sheet of £133.6 million and an operating loss of
£108.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (six months ended June 30, 2019: £59.0
million of operating profit).

During the third quarter of 2020, we saw an improving cash collections trend. Whilst the

easing of lockdown measures and the development of a vaccine have potentially lessened the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, we remained cautious.
Collections in the third quarter 2020 were £85.1 million representing 141% of the revised ERC,
and were partially driven by a catch-up in secured collections from earlier in the year. The
collections performance continued to be better than we predicted, with £78.1 million of collections
in the fourth quarter of 2020. Collections for the full year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to
£338.9 million (2019: £442.3 million), with collections during the six months ended December 31,
2020 representing 125% of revised ERC. Collections performance has continued to remain robust
in 2021, with collections in the first quarter of 2021 of £76.9 million (first quarter of 2020: £85.0
million) representing 106% of ERC and in the second quarter of 2021 of £102.7 million (second
quarter of 2020: £90.7 million) representing 131% of ERC. Collections during the six months
ended June 30, 2021 were £179.6 million, representing 119% of December 2020 ERC. Overall,
we have had a strong second quarter with our 2021 second quarter stand-alone results, with our


-----

profit before tax being 1.9 times greater than our first quarter in 2021. For the six months ended
June 30, 2021, we had a profit before tax and takeover costs of £22.9 million (loss of £135.9
million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), with £22.4 million of Acquisition costs
recognized and, together with the strong collections performance, this had a beneficial impact on
our leverage levels with our leverage for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 decreasing by
0.4 times from 5.1 times.

While the impact to our business has been significant, the wider dislocation caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers has also been significant. Following the global
financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2
trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests
on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges. Whilst we
have not yet experienced an increase in the willingness of Investment Portfolio Sellers to sell
defaulted debt, we expect that during late 2021 and into 2022, market activity will increase,
potentially leading to an increase in the volume of portfolios that we are able to acquire.

**_Cash collections_**

The main driver of our Balance Sheet business revenue is the performance of cash

collections on our portfolio investments (“Cash Collections”) and a significant driver of our Asset
Management and Servicing business revenue relates to the performance of cash collections on
behalf of our third-party service clients.

Our Existing Portfolios produced Cash Collections of £411.6 million in 2018, £442.3

million in 2019, £338.9 million in 2020 and £179.6 million during the six months ended June 30,
2021. The carrying value of our Existing Portfolios on our balance sheet was £1,028.0 million as
of June 30, 2021, £1,042.2 million as of December 31, 2020, £1,163.6 million as of December 31,
2019 and £1,087.0 million as of December 31, 2018. The 84-month ERC of our Existing Portfolios
on our balance sheet was £1,572.2 million as of June 30, 2021, £1,555.8 million as of
December 31, 2020, £1,817.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and £1,634.8 million as of
December 31, 2018.

As of June 30, 2021, 66% of our 84-month ERC represented unsecured portfolios and 34%

represented secured portfolios. As of June 30, 2021, 36%, 26%, 21%, 15% and 2% of our 84month ERC were originated in the UK, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland, respectively.
We acquire a broad range of portfolios, including, but not limited to, unsecured consumer loans,
(such as defaulted or non-performing credit card or personal loan debt), secured consumer loans,
(such as defaulted residential mortgage debt), defaulted commercial loans, (such as defaulted
commercial mortgage debt and unsecured commercial loan in a bankruptcy where the recovery
may be realization of business assets, cash in court, tax credits and real estate), and real estate,
(such as residential or commercial properties).

Central to maximizing the collections performance across this broad range of portfolios are

our local platforms, which utilize local knowledge and expertise. For example, our Italian business,
Europa Investimenti, acquires credit positions in commercial bankruptcies and uses its knowledge
of the court system and granular and forensic analysis of individual companies to assess


-----

opportunities. Europa Investimenti will identify an opportunity, such as an SME bankruptcy, and
typically, an opportunity will be fully underwritten by the Europa Investimenti investment team,
with underwriting assumptions verified by our central function. The purchase of the credit
positions in relation to the bankruptcy enables Europa Investimenti to recover against the assets of
the company. The assets may consist of cash in court, tax credits, unsecured debtor claims and/or
real estate. Furthermore, Europa Investimenti will often seek to purchase all or a majority of the
credits and seek to submit a Concordato proposal to the court. A Concordato is a specific Italian
bankruptcy procedure that allows an independent third-party to arrange a proposal to pay off
credits at a fixed rate in exchange for ownership of all assets of the bankruptcy. Proposals are
typically made after the finalization of the bankruptcy creditor list to reduce risk of late claims.
Any legal challenges against the court’s award of the Concordato are settled out of court, through
purchase of challengers’ bankruptcy credits. The Concordato process is voted upon by the creditors
and therefore, Europa Investimenti, as creditor, is in a position to accept the proposal, thereby
accelerating the timing of collections. In some cases, the assets will be pre-sold generating a high
Net Deal IRR. Europa Investimenti operate in very specific niche areas and utilize their knowledge
of the bankrupt company and legal and court processes to maximize the collection and importantly,
the timing of the collection.

The operation of Europa Investimenti is therefore very different to some of our other

platforms, such as Capquest in the UK. Capquest in the UK services unsecured consumer debt.
Collections are typically small, regular, annuity-like payments collected over a long period of time,
with a highly sophisticated data analytical and statistical approach to collections being employed.
Using data analytics, we formulate the most efficient, effective and regulation-compliant collection
strategy, which may involve litigation strategies. The amount a particular customer pays generally
varies depending on the portion of such customer’s disposable income available to service
defaulted debt. We generally pursue two broad types of collection activities:

    - Payment plans: most customers pay by entering into long-term repayment plans, which

provides us significant cash flow visibility.

    - One-off payments: arise when a payment (less than the full amount) leads to the closure

of the account and any remaining balance is written off. We make a settlement
assumption on each portfolio when it is purchased, which has an impact on the purchase
price.

An important component of our cash collection strategies is ensuring that we operate in

line with our values and achieve fair outcomes for customers in line with our regulatory
responsibilities. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customers, our forbearance and
vulnerable customer policies and processes were important for our customers. For further details
on our collections performance during 2020 and 2021, see “Significant Factors Affecting Results
_of OperationsImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” For further details on our service platforms_
and collection strategies, see “Business.”

**_Portfolio investments_**

Our performance is dependent on our ability to purchase investment portfolios since these

portfolios drive revenue for our Balance Sheet business and enable us to generate management


-----

and performance fees in our Fund and Investment Management business. Since the launch of
Arrow Credit Opportunities, our investments have typically been made through a co-investment
alongside the Fund by a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA, although we may continue
to make direct investments as well, primarily for certain strategic reasons. The current coinvestment level is typically 25%, however for future funds it is our intention to reduce this level
as we focus on growing our capital-light businesses. As such, the level of portfolio investments is
likely to remain broadly flat or may reduce slightly in the coming years.

As at December 31, 2018, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments

was £1,087 million and during 2018, the value of portfolios acquired was £263.4 million. As at
December 31, 2019, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,163.6
million and during 2019, the value of portfolios acquired in the year was £303.7 million. As at
December 31, 2020, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,042.2
million and during 2020, the value of portfolios acquired in the year was £109.9 million. As at
June 30, 2021, the balance sheet carrying value of our portfolio investments was £1,028.0 million
and during the six months ended June 30, 2021, the value of portfolios acquired was £94.8 million
(as compared to £42.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020).

There are several factors that influence the level and price at which our Balance Sheet

business and our Fund and Investment Management business acquire portfolios, with the supply
and demand for portfolios influencing the price of such portfolios. The supply of portfolios is
partly driven by the volume of debt/portfolios made available by debt originators in the primary
markets, together with the level of secondary sales made primarily by closed-end funds. We also
source portfolios through bankruptcy and other special situations. However, considering that our
business model is characterized by a strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise
on a granular level, we have been able to develop strong relationships with potential debt
sellers/originators, thereby allowing us to maximize our profits and avoid, to the extent possible,
acquiring portfolios through competitive auctions processes that often involve lower yields on
portfolios. We believe that our increasing drive towards off-market acquisitions leads to better
returns and during 2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our investment portfolios were
acquired through off-market deals. We expect to continue to source the majority of our portfolios
through such off-market strategy by leveraging our local presence and experienced local operators.

As mentioned above, the supply and demand for portfolios influences the price, and

therefore the return, available to us. The key metric used when assessing portfolios is Net Deal
IRR. Actual Net Deal IRR achieved will vary depending upon our performance against forecast.
Actual Net Deal IRR achieved is based on actual cash collections to date and the remaining ERC
and, as at June 30, 2021, the average Net Deal IRR achieved of 17% on all vintages since 2010,
represents 13% for on-market deals and 18% for off-market deals, highlighting the benefits of our
origination strategy. For details of Net Deal IRR by vintage, see “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our Business Model: Balance Sheet_
_Business.”_

The market dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on borrowers

has also been significant. Based upon the ECB’s stress tests on banks, we expect that NPLs could
reach a new peak at approximately €1.4 trillion. As such, we expect that the supply of portfolios
being offered by Investment Portfolio Sellers to increase and that this market dislocation will


-----

generate significant opportunities going forward. Furthermore, we expect that during late 2021
and into 2022, market activity will increase, potentially leading to an increase in the volume of
portfolios that we are able to acquire.

Given the uncertainty since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted a more

defensive and conservative investment strategy, investing in portfolios with typically shorter
weighted average lives, including more granular assets and a higher proportion of secured assets.
See “Business—Our Key Strengths—Highly cash flow generative with conservative risk
_management and strong balance sheet.” Our conservative approach to the underwriting of ERC_
has led to an over-performance of our actual collections against ERC. When measured from the
period from purchase to June 30, 2021, the actual cash collections represent 230% and 296% of
the expected collections at the time of underwriting for the 2020 and 2021 vintage years,
respectively. This in turn has created a significant upside in the Net Deal IRR for the 2020 vintage,
increasing from 16% at underwriting to 21% as at June 30, 2021. The 2021 vintage has been
underwritten at a similar Net Deal IRR of 16%, but given the over-performance on actual
collections to date, we would anticipate that the expected Net Deal IRR will increase in due course.

The ability to purchase debt portfolios through our Balance Sheet business is also

dependent on our internally generated cash resources and our access to financing at the time loan
portfolios become available for purchase. As we sought to preserve liquidity during 2020 in
response to weakened collections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we curtailed our
investment in portfolios. However, we believe that with our access to third-party capital through
our Fund and Investment Management business, we are well placed to continue to invest at scale,
which drives numerous benefits including, but not limited to, ongoing development of origination
capabilities by building on our trusted relationships with Investment Portfolio Sellers and
increased access to performance data on customers and portfolios, leading to more accurate
underwriting and operational leverage. This ability to scale operations, without the liquidity and
leverage constraints that impact many competitor debt management businesses, is a significant
competitive advantage and enables us to grow our earnings through capital-light revenues rather
than the more capital-intensive Balance Sheet business.

**_Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs and operational efficiency_**

Operational efficiency is key to our performance and, as such, controlling costs and

ensuring that our platforms are well invested and efficient is important. Our total operating
expenses comprise two elements, being Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs, which
encompass the direct costs of operations, and secondly, other operating expenses, which
encompass the indirect costs of our operations. The most significant direct and indirect costs relate
to staff costs with respect to our approximately 2,500 full time equivalent employees. By way of
illustration, our total staff costs for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £53.9 million which
amounted to 48% of our total costs (excluding costs associated with the Acquisition) for that
period.

We closely monitor costs incurred through a number of activities. Our annual budget

process requires all cost center owners to agree the costs, both direct and indirect, for their area of
responsibility. Any overspending against budgets are reviewed on a monthly basis. Furthermore,


-----

we utilize a number of metrics, such as EBITDA Margin and collection costs as a percentage of
Cash Collections, to highlight areas of inefficiency and seek to take action accordingly.

In addition, our central procurement function ensures a consistent approach to third-party

supplier management, through our policy that aims to ensure that:

    - risks associated with the contracting of third-party suppliers and partners for the

provision of business functions or services are understood;

    - management of third-party supplier and partner relationships reflect the risks associated

with the services being provided;

    - there are clear expectations and requirements for the management of third-party

supplier relationships before, during and after the contractual period of the supplier
relationship;

    - roles and responsibilities for managing third party supplier relationships are clearly

defined; and

    - the best possible commercial agreement is in place with all third-party suppliers.

Our procurement function assists the business in obtaining quotes and undertaking tenders

for contracts over specified limits, together with ensuring that any costs are approved prior to being
incurred with appropriate approval limits dependent upon the quantum of the costs to be incurred.

In addition, our centralized Human Resources (“HR”) function seeks to ensure

standardized processes, provide control around recruitment and implement training to ensure that
we maximize our talent. This ensures the alignment of our bonus schemes and enables pay
comparison between our different platforms and businesses.

Going forward, we expect to align our platforms vertically under a fund management

framework with greater accountability of our local operations. We expect that empowering our
local champion platforms with increased local accountability will engender a cost-ownership
culture where our operations in different jurisdictions will assume control and responsibility for
reducing costs incurred by that particular jurisdictional operation, as well as avoiding dual-layer
costs from the Group management structures. We believe that this, together with the expected cost
savings related to the transfer of the Target from public to private ownership, will deliver greater
operational efficiencies and cost reductions. See “Business—Cost Structure Development and Cost
_Saving Opportunities,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering_
_Memorandum includes forward-Looking Statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts_
_that involve risks and uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We_
_have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, and other financial_
_information not prepared in accordance with IFRS.”_

**_Impairment / fair value gains or losses on our portfolio investments_**

For our Balance Sheet business and Fund and Investment Management business, a key

driver of the results of our businesses is the ability to collect cash in line with or at levels above


-----

the ERC. We closely monitor Cash Collections on a weekly basis through our Weekly Collection
Review meeting, chaired by the CEO of our Asset Management and Servicing business and on a
monthly basis through our Fund Performance Management Meeting and our In-Country Portfolio
Performance Committees. See “BusinessOur investment process and operationsPortfolio
_Management.”_

In addition to the monitoring of actual Cash Collections, on at least a biannual basis and,

more frequently as required, we perform a review of our investment portfolios to ensure that the
ERC remains our best estimate of future collections. Our platforms, working together with our
portfolio management teams, will provide updates to the ERC, which will incorporate our macroeconomic and sector / geographical views and expectations. The reforecast ERC is then reviewed
and approved by the Portfolio Review Committee (“PRC”). Along with senior executive
management, including the Group CEO and Group CFO, the PRC is attended by the Chair of the
Audit Committee and the external auditors. See “ManagementOperational Committees.”

Any changes to the reforecast ERC will result in either an impairment / fair value gain, as

a result of an increase to the ERC, or an impairment / fair value loss, as a result of a decrease to
the ERC. Factors outside of our control, such as macro-economic factors or as recently experienced
with the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause such gains or losses. See “Significant Factors
_Affecting Results of OperationsImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Other factors, such as the_
performance of our platforms or other DCAs and servicers, ineffective litigation, regulatory or
legal compliance issues, may also result in portfolio investment gains or losses, which can affect
our business performance.

**_Revenues from our Fund and Investment Management operations_**

Revenues from our Fund and Investment Management operations are largely comprised of

management fees and performance fees, which as detailed under “Our business model: Our
_Structure,” accrue directly or indirectly to the Restricted Group. LP investors in the Fund, and any_
future funds, will pay ACML, the Fund Manager, management fees predominantly based on the
net asset value of funds managed, with a small amount paid on committed capital. In addition, LP
investors incentivize the Fund Manager through performance fees. See “Business—Our
_businesses—Fund and Investment Management business.”_

Performance-related fees are recognized only where it is highly probable that the revenue

will not be reversed in the future. This is generally near the end of the performance period or upon
early liquidation of a fund. Performance-related fees will only be crystallized when a performance
“hurdle” is met. The Fund has a hurdle rate of 7% - 8% Net Deal IRR, after which the Fund
Manager is entitled to broadly 20% of the returns above that level, with the Group being entitled
to 40% of these fees. Therefore, earning of performance fees is largely driven by our ability to
exceed the performance hurdle, including the Net Deal IRR for the relevant fund. For accounting
recognition purposes, the estimate of performance fees is made with reference to the liquidation
profile for the specific fund, which factors in portfolio exits and timeframes, and a constraint is
applied to the estimate to reflect uncertainty of future fund performance.

Since performance fees are predominantly generated on the net asset value, future revenues

from our Fund and Investment Management business will depend on our ability to invest the


-----

committed capital from the Fund and also attract LP investors for new funds. As of June 30, 2021,
54% of the Fund had been deployed or committed, including both third party investments and our
co-investments (64% of the Fund had been deployed excluding our co-investment) and we expect
to commence the fund raising for our second fund, ACO 2, in early 2022, when the capital
deployed, after recycling collections, within the Fund is approximately 70% of the total capital
commitments (provided that the deployment rate remains consistent with historical rates of
deployment). Our ability to attract new LP investors into our second fund will partly be dependent
upon the success of the Fund and the fund raising climate. Our revenues from the Fund and
Investment Management business will also depend on the terms that we are willing to offer to LP
investors and the terms we are able to negotiate with them, including hurdle rates and the level of
management fees.

Due to the co-invest model, revenues from our Balance Sheet business and Asset

Management and Servicing business will also be driven to some extent by the future growth of our
Fund and Investment Management business because our Balance Sheet business can co-invest into
the new assets managed by our Fund and Investment Management business, which can then be
serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business.

Given our transition to the integrated asset manager model and the development of the

Fund and Investment Management business, the Group’s segmental results for the year ended
December 31, 2020, together with comparatives for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been
presented for our three businesses, being the Fund and Investment Management, Asset
Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet businesses. In earlier periods, the segmental results
were presented for two divisions only, being the investment business and asset management and
servicing.

**_Profitability from our Asset Management and Servicing business_**

Revenue from our Asset Management and Servicing business relates to income from a

broad range of services that are offered by the Arrow platforms in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title
holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities,
securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities,
litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management.

The ability to increase revenue is driven by our ability to retain existing clients, win new

contracts and service a greater percentage of the portfolios acquired by the Fund.

During 2020, we won 26 new third-party contracts, a record number in any financial year,

and during the first half of 2021, we won a further 11 contracts. Furthermore, on August 17, 2021,
we announced plans to acquire the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s
Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service
to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will
need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven
expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The
partnership is expected to result in over 200 Tesco Bank personnel being transferred to us on
November 1, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for our services, as


-----

banks and other debt providers have seen an increase in arrears and require additional resources
and expertise in managing late stage arrears and defaulted customers. In addition to the external
clients serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business, the business also services
portfolios acquired by the Fund and our Balance Sheet business. The increased scale of our FUM
represents an important source of new contracts. As of June 30, 2021, 71% of the portfolios
acquired by the Fund were being serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing business.

In addition to the ability to increase revenues, it is equally important to control costs and,

through increased operational leverage as the platforms grow, the conversion of the Target from a
public to private company, the vertical alignment of our platforms under a fund management
framework with greater local accountability, we will seek to ensure that both new and existing
businesses achieve our stated target EBITDA Margin of 25%. A failure to grow revenue, with our
stated target being 10% CAGR per annum for each year until 2025, and to achieve our EBITDA
Margin will result in lower profit than anticipated within our Asset Management and Servicing
business. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted time
frames or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets_
_and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Regulatory considerations_**

Our results of operations are affected by a number of laws and regulations in the

jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment for debt collection in the UK and
the other countries in which we operate requires considerable investment in processes, know-how
and management. See “Risk FactorsRisks Relating to the Regulation of our BusinessOur UK
_operations are subject to significant oversight by UK regulators that view our operations as_
_“higher risk” activities. Failure to comply with such applicable laws, regulations and codes of_
_practice relating to debt purchase, collection and asset management industries in the UK could_
_result in substantial losses and the suspension, termination or impairment of our ability to conduct_
_business” and “Regulation and Compliance.”_

Any changes in the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could

constrain our ability to operate. See “Risk FactorsRisks Relating to the Regulation of our
_BusinessChanges to the regulatory environment in the future in the jurisdictions in which we_
_operate or an increasing volume of legislation may materially adversely affect the debt purchase_
_and collection and fund and asset management industries and impede our business and/or increase_
_our costs.” We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in a significant amount of financial_
and technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements. See
“ManagementOperational Committees.”

**_Investment in Systems and Processes_**

We continue to make investments in our capabilities to support the added complexity and

growth of a more diversified business. We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure to ensure that
it meets our objectives of flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. The COVID-19
pandemic presented, in real time and on a scale and timescale that could not have been forecast,


-----

the opportunity to test the resilience of our systems and our response was swift and successful. See
“Business—ESG.”

During 2020, we incurred £13.8 million in capital expenditure, being £11.4 million of

intangible assets, predominantly relating to IT and software license costs, and £2.5 million of fixed
assets, predominantly relating to leased assets. During 2019, we incurred £13.1 million in capital
expenditure, being £11.8 million of intangible assets and £1.3 million of fixed assets. We expect
our capital expenditure to remain broadly stable in 2021 compared to our historical capital
expenditures in 2020 and 2019. As we continue to grow our business, particularly through our new
Fund and Investment Management business, we expect that additional costs may be incurred, such
as in the development of our new funds system, but we expect that the significant portion of such
costs to be re-charged through designated charges to the Fund. See _Business—Our Business_
_Model—Our business model: Fund and Investment Management business” and “Business—Our_
_Business Model—Our business model: Our Structure.”_

**_Seasonality_**

We expect that our business will increasingly become less seasonal, as capital-light

revenues tend to be less volatile than those of the Balance Sheet business that can be impacted by
impairment gains or losses on the portfolio investments and the timing of portfolio purchases and
collections.

We review our ERC on a biannual basis to ensure that the expected Cash Collections

continue to be aligned with our expectations and such review may result in an increase or decrease
in our ERC. Any change in the ERC will result in an impairment / fair value gain, where the ERC
increases, or a loss, where the ERC decreases. See “ManagementOperational Committees.”

In addition, the timing of collections can be uneven during any financial year. As we

purchase a broad range of portfolios, some of which may comprise a portion or entirety of real
estate assets, the collection on such portfolios may be realized only when the asset is sold. In some
circumstances, the collection will be maximized by incurring capital expenditure before sale and
therefore the time to realize collections can be uncertain. Furthermore, certain portfolios may have
an uneven collections profile. For example, we have acquired a portfolio, which represents a
minority interest in a lending business in the Netherlands, where the final collection represents the
disposal of the underlying business and, as such, generates an uneven cash flow profile. See “Risk
_FactorsOther Risks Relating to our OperationsUneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent_
_us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities we would like to, and may result in us_
_experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results.”_

Furthermore, purchases of investment portfolios by our Balance Sheet business and by our

Fund and Investment Management business are likely to be uneven during a financial year due to
fluctuating supply and demand within the market, with a corresponding impact on leverage and
earnings. We typically purchase more loan portfolios in terms of purchase price in the fourth
quarter (when Investment Portfolio Sellers (financial institutions in particular) aim to sell assets
before their year-end) compared to each of the first three quarters. However, we aim to purchase
a particular amount of loan portfolios annually and, during some financial years, we may purchase
a higher or lower proportion of our targeted purchases earlier in the year. See “Risk


-----

_FactorsOther Risks Relating to our OperationsUneven portfolio supply patterns may prevent_
_us from pursuing all of the purchase opportunities we would like to, and may result in us_
_experiencing uneven cash flows and financial results.”_

As a result of one or all of the factors noted above, the results and performance of our

businesses may fluctuate due to such seasonal matters and may differ from our expectations.

**_Acquisitions_**

During 2018, the results of our operations were impacted by the acquisitions made during

that year. See “Business—Our History.” From time to time, we consider acquisitions that offer a
strategic opportunity to accelerate our growth and that will generate high returns on investment.
We also enter into certain other arrangements, such as partnerships, in connection with certain
portfolio acquisitions and certain origination and servicing arrangements. See “Risk Factors—
_Other Risks Relating to our Operations—We may make acquisitions or pursue joint ventures,_
_business combinations or other investments that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our_
_resources.”_

**Factors Impacting Comparability**

**_Further development of our business as an integrated asset manager_**

We reached an important landmark in November 2020, with the final close of our inaugural

fund, Arrow Credit Opportunities, which raised total capital commitments of €1.7 billion,
including our commitment. The development of our integrated asset manager model is important
to the successful execution of our strategy and our performance.

Our three businesses are complementary to one another. The Balance Sheet business co
invests alongside the Fund, typically at 25%, in new portfolio investments managed by our Fund
and Investment Management business, with approximately 71% of the portfolio investments being
serviced by our Arrow platforms within our Asset Management and Servicing business. See “—
_Our Business Model.”_

In addition, there are intangible benefits, with the building of intellectual property from the

investment at scale that this integrated model drives. We believe that being able to invest at scale
allows us to build origination capability through broadening and deepening relationships with
Investment Portfolio Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the
increased level of portfolios purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities,
leading to increased accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an
enabler to create operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing
business, allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable
deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our future funds,
enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the scale
of our businesses.

The above changes to our business model and strategy have had and will continue to have

an impact on the results of our operations, and as such, the results of operations and cash flows for


-----

future periods may not be comparable. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of
_Operations—Revenues from our Fund and Investment Management operations.”_

**_The Transactions_**

The Parent will account for the Acquisition under IFRS using the business combination

accounting criteria which requires separate recognition of the acquirer’s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of the Acquisition. These assets and
liabilities must be recognized at fair value at the date of the Acquisition. This will affect the
comparability of our future consolidated financial statements with the Target Group’s consolidated
financial statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. We will apply purchase accounting
adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to our financial statements. The application of
purchase accounting will result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may
add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill write-off, software,
and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments,
our financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made.

Furthermore, we will incur additional indebtedness and corresponding interest expense as

a result of the Transactions, which is expected to amount to approximately £85 million in
aggregate. As of June 30, 2021, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had
total indebtedness in the aggregate amount of £1,354 million, primarily consisting of the Notes
and the Revolving Facility. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our

business and future business opportunities, since a substantial portion our cash flow from
operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness, and this may place us at a
competitive disadvantage as some of our competitors are less leveraged.

**_Reporting_**

We present the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements in this Offering

Memorandum. After completion of the Acquisition, the Target Group will not prepare separate
consolidated financial statements and we instead intend to report our consolidated financial results
at the level of the Parent. Due to this, our future financial statements may not be comparable to the
Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. Our
future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may
not be comparable to the Target Group’s consolidated financial statements included in this
Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the disclosure and regulatory requirements for a private
company are generally less onerous than those for a public company and, as such, the level of
reporting and disclosure required may reduce following the Target’s re-registration as a private
company.

**_Strategic review_**

A strategic review will be completed shortly after the completion of the Transactions. The

output of this review may lead to changes within the business, such as organizational changes, that
may lead to a change in our reporting, for example to our segmental reporting and/or key


-----

performance metrics. Furthermore, there may be changes to our cost base, for example arising
from the change from a public to private company.

In particular, as we have grown into new markets and built out our servicing capability, we

have invested in centralized functions as part of the One Arrow programme, which sought
horizontal alignment of the business. As such, since the IPO in 2013, pre-exceptional cost income
ratio has moved from less than 50% to over 65%. Going forward, we believe there are areas of
centralization to retain, but that other functions are better and more efficiently delivered with local
accountability. We therefore expect an outcome of the strategic review will be to switch to a more
vertically aligned model with local champion platforms and corresponding local investment
strategies. We expect to maintain central origination and underwriting functions, supported by
local expertise. However, we expect to empower our local champion platforms with local
accountability and adopt a fund manager framework for the management of the local platforms.
We believe our focus on creating a cost-ownership culture will deliver efficiencies without creating
dual-layer costs and will lead to greater accountability. See “—Significant Factors Affecting
_Results of Operations—Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs and operational_
_efficiency,” “Business—Cost Structure Development and Cost Saving Opportunities,” “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-_
_looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and_
_uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We have included in this_
_Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data, and other financial information not_
_prepared in accordance with IFRS.”_

**Description of Key Performance Metrics**

**_Profit before and after tax, EBITDA and EBITDA Margin and segmental profit before tax,_**
**_EBITDA and EBITDA Margin_**

Profit before tax, together with EBITDA and EBITDA Margin, are measures of our

performance and we report our profit before tax, EBITDA and EBITDA Margin split by each
business. The segmental reporting of profit before tax, EBITDA and EBITDA Margin assist with
understanding how each of our businesses is performing and includes an allocation of indirect
operating costs. We use this segmental reporting, prepared on a monthly basis and included within
our management accounts, to monitor the performance of each of our businesses through our
Commercial Committee and the Board. See “ManagementOperational Committees.” Given the
development of our Fund and Investment Management business in 2019, the current segmental
analysis (including the Fund and Investment Management business) is only available from 2019.

(1) Group functions include adjustments made for acquisition costs of £22,356,000.

The level of taxation incurred by the business predominantly reflects the underlying

corporation tax rates in the jurisdiction where profits are generated. The Effective Tax Rate
(“ETR”) is measured as the tax charge divided by the loss or profit before tax. For 2018, 2019 and
2020, the ETR was 25.1%, 27.3% and 18.5% respectively and, after deducting the tax, the business
reports and monitors its profit after tax.

**_Profit before and after tax (before exceptional items)_**

Profit before tax and after tax is often stated within our financial statements before

exceptional items, an underlying profit before or after tax. The purpose of this metric is to adjust
for one-off exceptional items to assist the user in understanding the underlying results. In 2018,
we disclosed a number of exceptional items to report an underlying profit before tax as follows:

**2018**

**(£’000s)**

Reported profit before tax ............................................................... 39,991

Exceptional collection activity costs[(1)] ........................................... 1,080

Exceptional other operating expenses[(2)] .......................................... 22,676

Exceptional finance costs[(3)] ............................................................. 18,658

**Underlying profit before tax.........................................................** **82,405**

(1) Related to ‘One Arrow’ costs, which was a Group-wide program which began in 2017 and came to an end in 2018, and

included the development of a revised governance structure, office consolidations and IT/change investment across the Group.
Given the aggregate size and nature of this Group-wide transformation program, these costs have been presented as profit
adjusting items as they are considered to warrant separate presentation.

(2) Of the £22.7 million, £14.7 million relates to acquisition related costs, being £3.1 million related to acquisitions in 2018, and

£11.6 million related to contingent consideration payments on previous periods’ acquisitions. The remaining £8.0 million
related to ‘One Arrow’ costs as detailed in note (1) above.

(3) Bond refinancing costs consisted of £13.6 million relating to the call premium, along with £5.0 million due to a non-cash

write-off of related transaction fees, in connection with the refinancing of €230 million notes due 2023.


-----

There were no such exceptional reported items in the financial years ended December 31,

2019 or December 31, 2020.

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Target Group reported £22.4 million of

Acquisition costs. In light of the potential acquisition of the Target Group, a number of costs
relating to the Acquisition were accrued based on an estimate of the work performed by the Target
Group’s professional advisors and some share-based payments and retention arrangements for key
personnel below executive directors have been accelerated, all of which would have otherwise not
been incurred. Given the exceptional nature of the Acquisition, it is expected that there will be a
further exceptional or one-off items reported in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021
within the consolidated results of the Parent. These are expected to include the following and relate
to the Transactions:

    - One-off costs relating to the Acquisition, the refinancing of the Arrow Global

Revolving Credit Facility and, subject to the successful offering of the Notes, the
Existing Notes, totaling in aggregate an amount of approximately £75 million. These
costs relate to legal, bridge financing costs and other advice and will be expensed to
the profit and loss account during the period; and

    - A further amount of approximately £10 million relating to the raising of new debt,

being the Revolving Facility and the Notes offered hereby, will be capitalized in line
with IFRS and expensed over the duration of the Revolving Facility and the Notes
offered hereby using the EIR accounting method.

Furthermore, in the event that there are any restructuring or other costs arising from the

strategic review that will be undertaken by the Parent, it is likely that any such costs will treated
as exceptional costs. In addition, to these costs, under our business combinations accounting
policies, the consolidated results of the Parent may include further adjustments. See “Key
_accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimatesKey Accounting Policies.”_

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA represents our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and

amortization (including the amortization of portfolio investments), adjusted for any non-cash
income or expense items. Adjusted EBITDA is an approximate measure of the underlying cash
EBITDA of the Group and also features in our banking covenant measure.

Our businesses focus on Cash Collections and therefore, the Adjusted EBITDA provides

an important metric to understand the cash generation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA was
£294.0 million, £330.1 million, £233.2 million, £118.7 million and £131.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Further, Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was £245.6 million.
Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 and 2021 have been impacted by the weaker collections performance
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Significant Factors Affecting Results of
_OperationsImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”_


-----

**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_**

Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents current cash generation on a sustainable basis and is

calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, income taxes and overseas taxation paid and
amounts paid for the purchase of property, plant and equipment intangible assets. Adjusted Free
Cash Flow provides a measure of how much cash we generate across the reporting period which
we can use to reinvest in portfolio investments, repay debt or pay dividends. Adjusted Free Cash
Flow was £230.7 million, £261.4 million, £156.6 million and £90.7 million for the year ended
December 31. 2018, 2019, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. As with
the Adjusted EBITDA, the Adjusted Free Cash Flow in 2020 and 2021 has been impacted by the
weaker collections performance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA_**

Central to our strategy is to grow our capital-light businesses, being our Fund and

Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses. We believe that these
businesses will lead to more stable revenues, higher returns on capital employed and deleveraging.
Our target is to increase the EBITDA contribution of our capital-light businesses to more than 50%
by the end of 2025. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted
time frames or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets_
_and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

As our capital-light businesses grow, the capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group

EBITDA, being calculated as the sum of EBITDA of our Asset Management and Servicing
business and EBITDA of our Fund and Investment Management business, as a percentage of total
EBITDA, is expected to increase from 33.3% in 2019 to our target of 50% by 2025. Given the
losses sustained during 2020, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA was
negative 48.4%, but after adjusting for the non-cash write off of ERC in relation to the COVID-19
pandemic of £133.6 million, our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA would
have been 19.0%. Our capital-light businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA (pre-Acquisition
costs) was 22.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in our capital-light
businesses’ percentage of Group EBITDA since 2019 primarily reflects our investment in the fund
management infrastructure which we expect will in due course generate higher income as FUM
continue to grow.

**_Fund and Investment Management business – FUM and Fund Deployment_**

The development of our Fund and Investment Management business is a key driver for

growth within our business and, as such, the level of FUM is an important indicator of the
development of the business. Since management fees are generated on the capital invested in
portfolio purchases by the Fund Manager on behalf of LP investors, FUM is a key metric in
assessing the delivery against our plans. As at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, our
FUM was €3.7 billion and €4.3 billion, respectively. We have a target to achieve FUM of
approximately €10 billion (over £8.4 billion) by the end of 2025. However, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to meet such targets within the relevant time frame or at all. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This


-----

_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

To achieve this target for FUM, we will need to deploy the Fund to enable the

commencement of subsequent funds. We continue to successfully deploy capital in the Fund. As
of June 30, 2021 we had deployed 54% of the Fund (gross, before capital recycling and including
both third-party and balance sheet co-investment), compared with 45% as of March 31, 2021. The
Fund will need to be approximately 70% deployed before fundraising for a subsequent fund can
commence. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, excluding co-investment, the Fund is
approximately 64% deployed, which we believe puts us in a good position to begin fundraising for
a subsequent fund (ACO 2) in early 2022.

**_Portfolio investments and Net Deal IRR_**

We believe that the appetite for LP investors to invest in subsequent funds will be driven

by the risk profile and returns generated on previous funds and, in particular the Fund since it is
our inaugural fund. As such, Net Deal IRR is a key metric in assessing the returns that will
ultimately be generated for LP investors and also for Arrow SMA, driving the revenues of our
Balance Sheet business.

Net Deal IRR represents the return, based on gross collections after direct collection costs

(including any margin for the servicer). Net Deal IRR is calculated using the actual collections to
date and the ERC, which together represent the entire actual and expected future Cash Collections
on an investment portfolio. For the 2020 vintage, the Net Deal IRR, as at June 30, 2021, was 21%.
See “Our Business ModelOur business model: Balance Sheet business.”

The level of portfolio purchases by us, which have predominantly been made by Arrow

SMA since the beginning of January 2020 when the Fund commenced deployment, is important,
along with Net Deal IRR, to drive the revenue of our Balance Sheet business. Investment portfolios
purchased during the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020
and the six months ended June 30, 2021 were £263.4 million, £303.7 million, £109.9 million and
£94.8 million, respectively. The decrease in the level of purchases both in 2020 and during the first
half of 2021 reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see “Significant Factors Affecting
_Results of OperationsImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic”) and the transition to our integrated_
asset manager model, with purchases being made through co-investment alongside the Fund by
Arrow SMA. We expect that our transition to the integrated fund manager model will continue to
lead to reduced levels of portfolio investments as we focus on growing our capital-light businesses.

**_84-month and 120-month ERC_**

ERC represents the remaining Cash Collections on our portfolios and is measured over

both an 84-month and 120-month period. We acquire a broad range of portfolios, including, but
not limited to, unsecured consumer loans, such as defaulted or non-performing credit card or
personal loan debt, secured consumer loans, such as defaulted residential mortgage debt, defaulted
commercial loans, such as defaulted commercial mortgage debt and unsecured commercial loan
in a bankruptcy where the recovery may be realization of business assets, cash in court, tax credits
and real estate, and real estate, such as residential or commercial properties.


-----

The 84-month ERC of our Existing Portfolios on our balance sheet was £1,572.2 million

as of June 30, 2021, £1,555.8 million as of December 31, 2020, £1,817.9 million as of December
31, 2019 and £1,634.8 million as of December 31, 2018. As at June 30, 2021, 66% of our 84month ERC represented unsecured portfolios and 34% represented secured portfolios. At this date,
36%, 26%, 21%, 15% and 2% of our 84-month ERC was originated in the UK, Portugal, Italy, the
Netherlands and Ireland respectively. The 120-month ERC of our Existing Portfolios on our
balance sheet was £1,732.8 million as of June 30, 2021, £1,722.4 million as of December 31, 2020,
£2,035.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and £1,972.1 million as of December 31, 2018. Further,
the 120-month ERC suggests over £1.3 billion cash flow prior to the maturity of the 2026 Notes
in 2026.

**_Leverage_**

Leverage is measured as senior secured Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA and is a

key balance sheet metric. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our leverage was 4.7 times
compared to 5.1 times as at December 31, 2020, 3.4 times as of December 31, 2019 and 3.7 times
as of December 31, 2018.

Generally, we are aiming towards a Net Debt reduction and we are specifically targeting

our leverage to reach 4.0 times by the end of 2021 (before incurring the Transaction costs of
approximately £85 million) and to be within our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times by
2023. These targets are indicative only and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve
such targets within the planned time frame or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-_
_looking statements,_ _certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and_
_uncertainties.”_

Our shift to an integrated asset manager model is fundamental to our ability to grow our

earnings through the growth in our capital-light businesses, without the need to grow our balance
sheet. This in turn will lead to our ability to de-lever and reduce our Net Debt and, we believe, will
materially change our financial profile.

**Description of Key Balance Sheet Statement Items**

**_Portfolio investments_**

The primary assets held on our balance sheet are our investments in portfolios. The

following table sets forth details relating to our portfolio investments at the dates indicated.

-----

Portfolio investments held directly on our balance sheet are typically accounted for under

amortized cost, since the portfolio is deemed to be held within a ‘business model’ whose objective
is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
(“SPPI”). The Group’s co-investment alongside the Fund and Investment Management business
is deemed to be held in a different ‘business model’ other than ‘hold to collect,’ as these portfolio
investments are managed primarily on a fair value basis, with reporting to senior management on
the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key management remuneration
being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the ‘business model’
of these portfolios is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect
contractual cash flows and to sell the Portfolio Assets. As such, our co-investment alongside the
Fund and other co-investment portfolios purchased alongside other third-parties are classified as
fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).

As part of our investment activities, we sometimes acquire real estate positions as part of

a transaction. Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a
sale will immediately follow a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the
asset, such investments fall under the scope of IAS 2 – Inventories. In line with IAS 2, all assets
classified as inventories are held at initial cost, plus any subsequent cost of capital expenditure.
Such assets are held at the lower of cost and net realizable value, but apart from this, no gain or
loss will be taken on the value of the assets until the point at which they are sold, or partially sold.

Initially, investment portfolios – amortized cost are held at the purchase price less any

transaction fees. The effective interest rate (“EIR”) for the portfolio is calculated using the 84month ERC at underwriting. Revenue is calculated using the EIR method. On a biannual basis at
June and December each year, we update the 84-month ERC and the output is reviewed by the
PRC (chaired by the Group CEO), who consider any indicators of increases or decreases to our
ERC. Where loan portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, typically as the actual
collections during the period and remaining 84-month ERC is less than the 84-month ERC at the
start of the period, and an impairment loss is required to be recognized and we record an adjustment
to the carrying value of the loan portfolio. If the forecast loan portfolio collections exceed initial
estimates, typically as the actual collections during the period and remaining 84-month ERC is
greater than the 84-month ERC at the start of the period, we record an adjustment to increase the
carrying value of the loan portfolio. In accordance with IAS 39, we recognize any change in
carrying value in the statement of profit or loss. See “—Key accounting policies, judgements and
_assumptions and estimates—Key Accounting Policies.”_

For investment portfolios – FVTPL, the process is similar with a few notable exceptions.

Firstly, the initial costs of the acquisition, such as due diligence costs, are written-off to the profit
and loss statement as incurred. Second, the EIR is calculated using the lifetime ERC rather than
the 84-month ERC and whilst the EIR for an amortized cost portfolio will remain the same
throughout the life of the transaction, under FVTPL, the EIR is adjusted for changes in market
rates. As such, investment portfolios – FVTPL are effectively held at their fair value through the
life of the transaction.


-----

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill on the balance sheet as at December 31, 2020 was £278.3 million, relating to the

acquisitions made by the Target Group. See “Business—Our History and Development.” This
goodwill is recorded within the accounts of the Target and will not be reported on a go-forward
basis in the consolidated accounts of the Parent. See “—Key accounting policies, judgements and
_assumptions and estimates—Key Accounting Policies.” For accounting purposes, the goodwill is_
allocated, at acquisition, to a Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”). We have identified four CGUs: (i)
UK and Ireland, comprising all Group companies acquired in the Capquest acquisition, Arrow
Global Receivables Management Limited, Mars Capital, Bergen and Drydens; (ii) Portugal,
comprising all of the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar, Gesphone, Redrock and Norfin
acquisitions; (iii) Benelux, comprising all the Group companies acquired in the Vesting
acquisition; and (iv) Italy, comprising Zenith, Parr Credit and Europa Investimenti S.p.A. The UK
and Ireland, Portugal, Benelux and Italy CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally
from collections on acquired portfolio investments, management and servicing of third-party debt
and fund and investment income. At each year end, an impairment review is carried out, using
cash flow forecasts and an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. As at December 31, 2020,
an impairment review was undertaken and we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill as at December 31, 2020 was allocated to the CGUs as follows: £78.9 million to UK and
Ireland, £73.6 million to Portugal, £43.1 million to Benelux and £82.7 million to Italy.

_Income from portfolio investments at amortized cost_

We recognize revenue from portfolio investments in accordance with IFRS 9 using the EIR

method. The EIR is defined as the portfolio’s IRR based on the portfolio purchase price and
forecast 84-Month ERC as of the date of purchase for portfolios held at amortized cost. The
calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part
of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition, such as legal and due diligence fees.


-----

We reassess and adjust the EIR up to twelve months after the purchase of each loan

portfolio to reflect refinements made to our estimates of future cash flows based on enhanced data
and analysis considered during that time period. This adjustment has historically not resulted in
any material impact on income from portfolio investments.

Income from portfolio investments at amortized cost is then calculated by multiplying the

carrying value of each loan portfolio as of the beginning of the period by the EIR.

_Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL_

For the portfolios held at an amortized cost, the total returns from the portfolio include the

interest income, reported through Income from portfolio investments at amortized cost, together
with changes arising from Cash Collections being different from the ERC and also from changes
to our ERC, which are reported through the impairment gains/(losses) on portfolio investments.
For portfolios held at FVTPL, the fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL represents
all of the income and expenses relating to our portfolio investments which are classified as FVTPL.
The line item includes fair value changes, interest and dividends.

As such, the fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL on a portfolio will

represent the change in the carrying value of the portfolio, together with the actual Cash
Collections on the portfolio. The carrying value is assessed based on the ERC at the period-end,
discounted at the EIR. The EIR is calculated using the lifetime ERC, rather than an 84-month ERC
for amortized cost portfolios, and the EIR will vary during the life of the portfolio due to changes
in the risk free rate or other market movements.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of portfolios, such as legal

and due diligence fees, for portfolios held at FVTPL are expensed directly to the statement of
income and expenditure as incurred. This is different from the treatment for a similar portfolio
held at amortized cost.

_Impairment (losses)/gains on portfolio investments_

As noted above, an important component in the accounting for both portfolio investments

held at amortized cost and at FVTPL, is our assessment of the ERC. See _“—Key accounting_
_policies, judgements and assumptions and estimates—Key Accounting Assumptions and_
_Estimates—Carrying value of portfolio investments.”_

We reassess our ERC at least every six months utilizing both the local knowledge from the

servicer and the broader macro factors. Following the re-assessment of our ERC, we re-calculate
the carrying value of the portfolio using the EIR, which for portfolios held at amortized cost does
not change after the initial period up to the twelve-month period. Any change in the carrying value
of such portfolios is reported as an Impairment gains/(losses) on portfolio investments.

In assessing the carrying value of Portfolios held at amortized cost, we will continue to use

the 84-month ERC and as such, absent any other changes, the carrying value will increase from
one period to the next as forecast collections in month 85 are included within the calculation. Such
expected collections are discounted using the EIR to calculate the change in value of the carrying


-----

value. Since several of our portfolios, particularly our unsecured portfolios, have long annuity type
collection profiles, such future collections are not included within our 84-month ERC.

_Income from real estate inventories_

As part of our investment activities, we sometimes acquire real estate positions as part of

a transaction. Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a
sale will immediately follow a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the
asset, such investments fall under the scope of IAS 2 – Inventories. In line with IAS 2, income is
recognized at the time of disposal of the real estate and is measured as a gain or loss on the
transaction, based on the sale proceeds, after any selling costs, less the cost of acquisition, after
any acquisitions fees and costs, and less the costs of any capital expenditure incurred.

_Income from asset management and servicing and fund and investment management_

Income from our Asset Management and Servicing business and our Fund and Investment

Management business, i.e., our capital-light businesses, are predominantly reported as Income
from asset management and servicing and fund and investment management.

Income from asset management and servicing contracts with clients is measured based on

the consideration specified in a contract with a client. We recognize revenue when the Asset
Management and Servicing business satisfies a performance obligation related to a service it has
undertaken to provide to a client. Servicing income makes up the majority of the asset management
and servicing income, and in itself comprises a broad range of services, including secured and
unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding, data analytical
forecasting, due diligence activities, forensic valuations, initial platform migration and onboarding activities, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new
origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer
management. In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time that corresponds to
the satisfaction of the related performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing
income is normally recognized as the services are provided to the client, with no deferral or
acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract.

Fund and investment management income encompasses services provided in relation to the

discretionary and semi-discretionary allocation and management of third-party capital. Fees for
fund and investment management services are normally calculated based on a fixed percentage of
the value of assets managed and deducted from the client’s account balance on a regular basis.
Income from fund and investment management services is recognized over time as the services
are provided.

Performance-related fees are recognized only where it is highly probable that the revenue

will not be reversed in the future. This is generally near the end of the performance period or upon
early liquidation of a fund. Performance-related fees will only be crystallized when a performance
hurdle is met. The estimate of performance fees is made with reference to the liquidation profile
for the Fund, which factors in portfolio exits and timeframes. A constraint is applied to the estimate
to reflect uncertainty of future fund performance. To date, no performance fees on the Fund have
been recognized.


-----

In some instances, fees may be paid to a third party which are directly linked to the

acquisition of a long-term contract with a client. In line with IFRS 15 requirements, such costs are
included on the balance sheet as a cost to acquire a client contract, and are released to the
comprehensive statement of profit or loss over time, on a profile corresponding with the period
over which economic benefits will be derived from the contract. As at December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, we had assets relating to contracts with clients in the amount of £8.8 million
and £3.1 million, respectively. These assets fully relate to up-front costs which were incurred to
acquire clients within our Fund and Investment Management business, and will be released to the
comprehensive statement of profit and loss across the same period as the associated income will
be recognized, which is the lifetime of the related fund.

A key judgement made in recognizing these costs which were incurred to acquire clients

was whether or not the investors in the Fund met the definition of a “customer” in accordance with
IFRS 15. Given the relatively small number of typically larger, institutional investors with which
we engage on an individual basis as part of the client acquisition process, this was deemed to meet
the definition of a “customer” under IFRS 15 guidance. As at December 31, 2020, the weighted
average life remaining on these contract balances was 7 years and 9 months. The contract balances
amortized in the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a £0.7 million of amortization
expensed to the comprehensive statement of profit and loss in 2020 with no expense in prior
periods.

million was a cash cost related to the call premium. The remaining £5.0 million was
due to a non-cash write-off of related transaction fees, in connection with the 2023
Notes.

**_Taxation charge/(credit) on ordinary activities_**

We have entities in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, Guernsey and Jersey.

Corporation tax is payable in respect of our entities incorporated in these jurisdictions, based on
taxable profits, which are different from the reported profits, and the relevant tax rate applicable
in each jurisdiction.

Given the predominance of our UK activities, the analysis in our consolidated financial

statements uses the UK corporate statutory tax rate prevailing in the accounting period in question.
A summary of the taxation charge, our effective tax rate and the differences in the effective tax
rate for the period against the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK is shown in the table
below:


-----

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**2018** **2019** **2020**

**(£’000)**

Profit/(loss) before tax ............................................................................... 39,991 51,320 (114,823)

Tax charge at standard UK corporation tax rate ....................................... 7,598 9,751 (21,816)

Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions .................................................. 2,606 2,052 1,950

Changes in estimates relating to prior years ............................................. (933) 2,421 (5,077)

Expenses not deductible for tax purposes .................................................. 768 (358) 2,293

Changes in corporate tax rates during the year .......................................... (17) (1,209) 842

Movements in unrecognized deferred tax .................................................. — 1,376 602

**Total tax charge/(credit) .........................................................................** **10,022** **14,033** **(21,206)**

Effective Tax Rate .................................................................................... 25.1% 27.3% 18.5%

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, our effective tax rate was 10.0%. The primary

driver for this lower tax charge is the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset to reflect the
enactment of Finance Act 2021, which increases the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%
effective from April 1, 2023. At the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government
announced an increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023,
and setting the rate at 25% which rate was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act
2021 on June 10, 2021. The 10% effective tax rate primarily reflects the impact of a £3.7 million
credit to reflect the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset, representing UK tax losses, as a result
of the Finance Act 2021.

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected

to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the end of the reporting period. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at
the end of each period in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes). The value of recognized
deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that
it is probable that based on available evidence, both positive and negative, sufficient taxable profits
will be available to allow the asset to be recovered. If it is probable that some portion of these
assets will not be realized, then no asset is recognized in relation to that portion. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability
is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the end of the reporting period.

As of December 31, 2020, we had a deferred tax asset of £27.7 million relating to losses,

including £98.2 million of UK tax losses, which are held on the balance sheet as a deferred tax
asset of £18.7 million, due to the losses arising from the non-cash impairment arising in the year
ended December 31, 2020. Of the remaining £9.0 million deferred tax asset relating to losses, the
majority relate to £27.3 million of tax losses in the Netherlands, due to the difference in the
recognition of accounting profits and taxable profits within the Netherlands.

The recent tax changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate are as follows:

(a) The Finance (No.2) Act 2015, as amended by the Finance Act 2016, included
provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from April
1, 2020. The UK Government enacted legislation for the rate to remain at 19%. At
the March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an
increase to the rate of UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023,


-----

and setting the rate at 25% which rate was approved with the passing into law of
the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021.

(b) In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands.
Consequently, as of January 1, 2020, the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands was
reduced from 25% to 21.7%. This change resulted in a gain of £1,147,000 related
to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of our Dutch subsidiaries
being recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. In September 2020,
the Dutch Government announced the reversal of this planned decrease,
maintaining the rate at 25%. A credit of £1,147,000 has been reflected in the year
ended December 31, 2020, which reverses the prior year restatement.

_Portfolio investments_

Purchased portfolio investments decreased £14.9 million, or 1.4%, from £1,042.2 million

as of December 31, 2020 to £1,027.3 million as of June 30, 2021. This decrease was principally
due to the fact that collections exceeded income (together with any impairment gains or losses)
and the re-investment in portfolios. Cash collections in the first half of 2021 were £179.6 million
(six months ended June 30, 2020: £175.7 million), reflecting our continued robust operational
performance and the execution of a range of active portfolio management actions, despite the
continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unsecured collections from our UK business
benefited from the recommencement of litigation collections strategies, with an acceleration of
activity in during the fourth quarter of 2020 supporting strong performance throughout the first
half of 2021. Elsewhere in Europe our unsecured collections remained robust and generally the
performance of this asset class underlines the strength of our underwriting processes. Secured asset
collections in Italy and Portugal during the first quarter of 2021 were impacted by the COVID 19
pandemic which halted real estate market transactions and court processes, such as auctions,
impacting the resolution of larger positions.

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments increased by £153.1 million, from a loss of £42.4

million as of June 30, 2020 to £110.7 million as of June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due
to the non-recurrence of the non-cash impairment charge of £120.8 million in income during the
six months ended June 30, 2020 relating to the write-down of the ERC balance sheet asset. See
“—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” For
the six month period ended June 30, 2021, there was a net impairment gain of £17.7 million on the
investment portfolios held at amortized cost.

_Income from Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses_

Income from Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing

businesses increased by £10.1 million, or 22%, from £45.5 million as of June 30, 2020 to £55.6
million as of June 30, 2021. This increase was due to both the increase in management fees within
the Fund and Investment Management business and the increase in servicing revenue within our
Asset Management and Servicing business. Our Fund and Investment Management business
generated third-party management fee income of £10.8 million in the first half of 2021 (six months
ended June 30, 2020: £5.6 million) reflecting the strong level of capital deployment in the Fund.
The second quarter of 2021 saw the highest rate of fund deployment to date, and, according to our
assessments, we believe that we are on track to begin fundraising for our second fund in early
2022. FUM were €4.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 (December 31, 2020: €4.3 billion), including the
Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and Servicing business subsidiaries of
Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta. The increase in FUM was driven primarily by Norfin and
Sagitta. The Asset Management and Servicing business continues to benefit from the servicing
opportunities arising from the deployment of the Fund. Asset management and Servicing income
from third-parties increased by 12.6% to £44.8 million (six months ended June 30, 2020: £39.8
million), reflecting the 37 new third-party contracts won between the start of 2020 and June 30,
2021. Third-party demand for our asset servicing capability remains high as the volume of
European NPL assets grow, with 11 new contracts won in the first half of 2021, following on from
the record 26 contract wins during 2020.


-----

_Operating expenses_

Operating expenses increased by £23.3 million, or 21%, from £112.3 million as of June 30,

2020 to £135.6 million as of June 30, 2021. Given that certain operating expenses relating to the
Acquisition were incurred during the relevant period that would otherwise not have been incurred
in the reporting period (including the professional advisor fees incurred and because certain
share-based payments and retention arrangements for key personnel below the executive director
level were accelerated), accounts for £22.4 million of the aforementioned £23.3 million increase
in operating expenses. Total operating expenses before the Acquisition-related costs increased
slightly to £113.2 million (six months ended June 30, 2020: £112.3 million). This increase was
principally due to the combined effects of the following:

_Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_

Management Costs increased by £2.1 million, or 3%, from £64.3 million as of June 30, 2020 to
£66.4 million as of June 30, 2021. While there was a reduction in Collection Activity and Fund
Management Costs during the relevant period, this was offset by an increase in litigation costs and
fund management costs, with the latter being driven by the build out of the Fund and Investment
Management business, including a number of strategic hires in 2021, the creation of new teams
and the build out of functions, as well as other costs associated with the strategic pivot to the asset
manager model.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses (excluding £22.4 million of costs_

related to the Acquisition) decreased by £2.1 million, or 43%, from £48.0 million as of June 30,
2020 to £46.8 million as of June 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to strong cost control,
which was largely offset the accrual for increased bonus payments during the six months ended
June 30, 2021.

_Finance costs_

Net finance costs increased slightly by £3.2 million, or 12%, from £27 million as of June

30, 2020 to £30.2 million as of June 30, 2021. This increase was in line with expectations and
reflected the successful tap offering of the 2026 Notes completed during the first quarter of 2021.

_Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_

Taxation on ordinary activities decreased from a taxation credit of £25.5 million as of

June 30, 2020 to a taxation charge of £1.4 million as of June 30, 2021. This primarily reflects the
losses arising during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to the non-cash impairment charge
of £120.8 million, compared with the profit before taxation during the six months ended June 30,
2021.

The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was 10.0%, compared to

18.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The low effective tax rate primarily reflects the
credit of £3.7 million due to the restatement of the UK deferred tax asset, arising from the losses
incurred in 2020. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the tax losses and temporary timing differences are expected to reverse. At the
March 2021 United Kingdom budget, the UK government announced an increase to the rate of


-----

UK corporation tax for the year, commencing April 1, 2023, and setting the rate at 25% which rate
was approved with the passing into law of the Finance Act 2021 on June 10, 2021.

_Profit/(loss) after tax_

As a result of the foregoing factors, loss after tax decreased by £109.6 million, or 99%,

from £110.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to £0.9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021. Without adjusting for takeover costs related to the Acquisition, profit before
taxation for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £22.9 million, with an associated taxation of
£2.3 million. As such, without adjusting for takeover costs related to the Acquisition, profit after
taxation for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £20.6 million.

**_Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 compared to consolidated balance sheet as_**
**_of December 31, 2019_**

_Portfolio investments_

Purchased portfolio investments decreased £121.4 million, or 10.4%, from £1,163.6

million as of December 31, 2019 to £1,042.2 million as of December 31, 2020. This decrease was
principally due to lower collections and lower investments in new portfolio acquisitions as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact
_of the COVID-19 pandemic.” As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively managed_
cash in the first half of 2020 and took decisive action to reduce the level of investments. We
experienced a slowdown in the market, predominantly driven by financial institutions taking a
prudent approach to valuations and banks focusing on initial provisioning over asset sales during
the first half of 2020. Full-year purchases for 2020 were £109.9 million (2019: £303.7 million),
partly due to the impact of COVID-19 impact as well as our new investment model. In 2020, our
balance sheet was typically invested alongside the Fund, with our participation in the Fund being
at 25%.

In 2020, balance sheet cash collections from our portfolio asset base were £338.9 million

(2019: £442.3 million), with the decrease primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
as government imposed lock-downs and customer uncertainty reduced collections performance.
As a result of the uncertainty, we revalued the ERC balance sheet asset as of June 30, 2020
resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio investments in the amount of £133.6 million,
subsequently reducing to £95.5 million as of December 31, 2020. Cash collections performed well
against revised estimates in the second half of 2020, outperforming by approximately 25%. See
“—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” for
further details of the write down to the ERC.

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments decreased £175.2 million, or 71.6%, from £244.8

million in 2019 to £69.6 million in 2020. This decrease was principally due to the non-cash
impairment as noted above, together with the lower revenue from lower investments.

_Income from Asset Management and Fund and Investment Management businesses_

Income from Asset Management and Fund and Investment Management businesses

increased £2.6 million, or 2.8%, from £94.4 million in 2019 to £97.0 million in 2020. This increase,
despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates the resilience of the income from our capital-light
businesses. The £2.6 million increase was principally due to the increased revenue generated by
our Asset Management and Servicing business that, throughout 2020, secured a record 26 new
contract wins, driven by demand for us as a servicing partner for financial institutions that require
additional collections capacity given the growth of NPL volumes as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. Furthermore, the launch of the Fund in late 2019 meant that we started to generate
additional management fees within our Fund and Investment Management business.

_Total operating expenses_

Operating expenses decreased £8.9 million, or 3.8%, from £233.7 million in 2019 to £224.8

million in 2020. This decrease was principally due to the combined effects of the following:

_Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_

Management Costs decreased £0.9 million, or 0.7%, from £131.5 million in 2019 to £130.6 million
in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to reduced litigation activity, which was curtailed due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, with legal disbursements reducing from £14.4 million in 2019 to £8.9
million in 2020, partially offset by higher direct operating costs, primarily from our investment in
the Fund and Investment Management business following the launch of the Fund in late 2019.
Since a portion of our collections activity is outsourced to third-parties, weaker collections
performance will result in a reduction in the costs payable.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased £8.0 million, or 7.8%, from_

£102.2 million in 2019 to £94.2 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to strict cost
control as we sought to mitigate the impact of weaker collections and the non-impairment write

-----

down of the ERC. For a period during 2020, we cancelled all non-essential operating and capital
expenditure whilst we evaluated the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Finance costs_

Net finance costs increased £3.0 million, or 5.5%, from £54.6 million in 2019 to £57.6

million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to our raising the Euro Non-Recourse Facility to
strengthen the balance sheet and provide additional financing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_

Taxation on ordinary activities decreased from a taxation charge of £14.0 million in 2019

to a taxation credit of £21.2 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to losses incurred
during the year as a result of the non-cash impairment. We recognized a deferred tax asset in
relation to losses of £27.7 million (2019: £6.4 million), of which £18.7 million (2019: £nil) relate
to the UK.

The effective tax rate 18.5% in 2020, compared to a rate of 27.3% in 2019. The difference

primarily relates to the impact of the non-cash impairment, which was predominantly incurred in
the UK which has a lower standard corporation taxation rate than the other jurisdictions in which
we operate.

_Profit after tax_

As a result of the foregoing factors, profit after tax decreased from a profit of £37.3 million

for 2019 to a loss of £93.6 million for 2020.

**_Consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 compared to consolidated balance sheet as_**
**_of December 31, 2018_**

_Portfolio investments_

Purchased portfolio investments increased £76.6 million, or 7%, from £1,087.0 million as

of December 31, 2018 to £1,163.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase was principally
due to the high levels of investments made. Throughout 2019, the pricing environment and
quantum of opportunities within our markets remained attractive and we committed to investing a
record £303.7 million in new portfolios, with £62.9 million of this payment deferred to 2020 (2018:
£263.4 million purchased, with £12.0 million deferred). Cash collections during 2019 from our
purchased portfolio asset base increased to £442.3 million (2018: £411.6 million), reflecting
continued strong operational performance. As of December 31, 2019, we had cumulatively
collected 104% of our initial underwriting expectation on all portfolios, consistent with the
position as of December 31, 2018. We purchased an increasing proportion of secured assets,
including real estate assets. Whilst cash collections from unsecured assets, our original asset class,
tend to be recognized on a more consistent basis quarter to quarter, the increasing cash collections
from secured assets, where cash collections are more frequently realized at one point in time, rather
than collected gradually over time, was resulting in greater quarterly variability of cash collections.
However, secured portfolios typically have a shorter payback than unsecured portfolios.

**_December 31, 2019 compared to consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year_**
**_ended December 31, 2018_**

_Income from portfolio investments_

Income from portfolio investments decreased £24.6 million, or 9.1%, from £269.4 million

in 2018 to £244.8 million in 2019. This decrease was principally due to a significant reduction in
upwards revaluations of portfolios held on the balance sheet. Revaluations in 2018 were positively
impacted from specific litigation work that was undertaken on the back book to drive cash
collections from unpaying accounts. Lower levels of revaluations led to a 75.0% reduction in noncash impairment gains to £12.7 million (2018: £50.7 million).

_Income from Asset Management and Servicing business_

Income from Asset Management and Servicing business increased £2.7 million, or 2.9%,

from £91.7 million in 2018 to £94.4 million in 2019. This increase was principally due to the
ongoing growth of our Asset Management and Servicing business as we sought to increase our
capital-light revenues. During 2019, we continued our strategy of co-investing alongside other
investors with the aim of servicing the entire portfolio.

_Total operating expenses_

Operating expenses decreased £21.3 million, or 8.4%, from £255.0 million in 2018 to

£233.7 million in 2019. The reporting split of total operating expenses was changed from 2019 to
2020, with a reclassification between ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ and ‘other
operating expenses,’ as part of the change in the segmental reporting structure aligned to the
integrated asset management model. The total operating expenses impact was nil, with the main
movement between the categorizations relating to allocation of internal staff costs and professional


-----

fees. The decrease in our operating expenses was principally due to the combined effects of the
following:

_Collection Activity and Fund Management Costs. Collection Activity and Fund_

Management Costs increased £4.9 million, or 4.1%, from £119.0 million in 2018 to £123.9 million
prior to restatement in 2019 (£131.5 million post-restatement). The Collection Activity and Fund
Management Cost ratio improved by 4.1 percentage points to 24.8% (2018: 28.9%) as we
continued to extract efficiencies within our Asset Management and Servicing business and reduced
the number of lower margin servicing contracts.

_Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses decreased £12.1 million, or 8.9%,_

from £136.0 million in 2018 to £123.9 million prior to restatement in 2019 (£102.2 million postrestatement). This decrease was primarily driven by the release of provisions held against the
payment of deferred consideration against previous business acquisitions. This collectively totaled
£21.7 million and was also driven by the realignment of remuneration for management teams in
accordance with our strategy of growing our capital-light businesses.

_Finance costs_

Net finance costs decreased £12.3 million, or 18.4%, from £66.8 million in 2018 to £54.5

million in 2019. This decrease was due to the non-recurrence of exceptional bond costs incurred
in 2018. In 2018, bond refinancing costs comprised £18.7 million incurred on the early redemption
of the €230 million floating rate senior secured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), of which £13.6
million was a cash cost related to the redemption premium. The remaining £5.0 million was related
to a non-cash write-off of transaction fees, incurred in connection with the 2023 Notes. Underlying
net interest charges of £54.5 million increased by £6.3 million or 13.1% on the £48.2 million
amount incurred during 2018 as a function of the unwind of the discount rate on deferred
consideration, higher facility balances in the period and the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16
lease accounting.

_Taxation credit/(charge) on ordinary activities_

Taxation charge on ordinary activities increased £4.0 million, or 40%, from £10.0 million

in 2018 to £14.0 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in profit before
taxation by 28.3%, together with the increase in the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate in 2019 was 27.3%, compared to 25.1% as in 2018, primarily

reflecting the increase in profits generated in the territories in which we operate (other than the
UK) where the standard corporation taxation rate is higher than in the UK.

_Profit after tax_

As a result of the foregoing factors, profit after tax increased £7.3 million, or 24.3%, from

£30.0 million in 2018 to £37.3 million in 2019.

(1) Net Debt does not reflect debt issuance costs. Going forward, Net Debt will include the outstanding principal amount of the Notes from the
date of issuance. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information—Net Debt” for information of how Net Debt is calculated._

(2) Secured Net Debt is debt that is secured and includes the Existing Notes, the Revolving Facility, the Non-Recourse Facilities and the
Miscellaneous Facilities (net of cash).

(3) Leverage is calculated as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is £131.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2021. See note 8 in “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information—Other Financial Data” for information on how Adjusted EBITDA is calculated._

(4) The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is liquidity headroom, which includes cash and cash equivalents and the
headroom under committed facilities, being the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility. After giving effect to the Offering and the use of
proceeds therefrom, from the Issue Date, liquidity headroom will include cash and cash equivalents and the headroom under committed
facilities, the Revolving Facility. Liquidity headroom excludes certain cash which may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance
can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date.

(5) Represents Net Debt/84-Month ERC.

(6) Represents Secured Net Debt/84-Month ERC.

We are highly operationally cash generative before purchases of investment portfolios.

Adjusted EBITDA in the six months ended June 30, 2021 was £131.2 million, representing 11%
of our Net Debt. We believe we have a prudently managed balance sheet.

As noted in the table above, as of June 30, 2021, our Secured Net Debt divided by Adjusted

EBITDA or leverage was 4.7 times compared to 5.1 times as at December 31, 2020. We are
targeting our leverage to reach 4.0 times by the end of 2021 (before incurring costs of
approximately £85 million related to the Acquisition), and to be within our target range of
approximately 3.0-3.5 times by 2023. These targets are indicative only and there can be no
assurance that we will be able to achieve such targets within the planned time frame or at all. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

As of June 30, 2021, our borrowings under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility,

pre-netting of transaction fees, were £201.5 million, compared to £277.5 million as of


-----

December 31, 2020. We maintained a strong cash and liquidity position during 2020, having raised
an additional €104.7 million through the Euro Non-Recourse Facility in July 2020. As of the Issue
Date, the Arrow Global Revolving Facility was cancelled and the Revolving Facility was partially
drawn. A portion of the proceeds of the Notes will be used to repay the Existing Notes and a
portion of the drawings under the Revolving Facility. As of the Issue Date, after giving effect to
the Transactions and use of proceeds therefrom, we expect that £55 million will be drawn and
outstanding under the Revolving Facility. We expect that our increased focus on reducing capital
intensity and growing earnings from our capital-light businesses will result in higher levels of cash
generation and lower requirements to invest in portfolios to generate cash returns in the future.

Furthermore, the Offering of the Notes is expected to increase the level of liquidity

headroom from £190 million as of the year ended December 31, 2020 to £347 million after
completion of the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” Our ability to generate cash from our
operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some
extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of
which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

**_Cash flow_**

The following table summarizes the principal components of our consolidated cash flows

for the periods under review:


**For the year ended**

_Cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to cash flow for six months ended_
_June 30, 2020_

Net cash generated by operating activities decreased by £12.4 million, or 23%, from £54.1

million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to £41.7 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2021. The decrease was principally due to higher portfolio purchases during the six
months ended June 30, 2021 of £94.8 million as compared to £42.9 million in the corresponding
period in 2020, partially offset by higher payments of deferred consideration on portfolios incurred
in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by £5.2 million, or 42%, from £12.4 million

during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to £17.6 million during the six months ended June 30,
2021. This increase was largely due to the increased payment of deferred consideration paid in
connection with subsidiary acquisitions of £8.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021
compared to £3.3 million in the corresponding period in 2020.

Net cash generated by financing activities decreased £102.1 million, from a cash generation

of £15.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to a cash usage of £86.4 million during


-----

the six months ended June 30, 2021. This was primarily as a result of utilizing cash balances to
repay amounts drawn under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and amounts drawn under
the Non-Recourse Facilities. The proceeds from the tap offering of the 2026 Notes executed in
early 2021 were used to similarly repay amounts drawn under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit
Facility.

_Cash flow for year ended 2020 compared to cash flow for year ended 2019_

Net cash generated by operating activities increased £35.0 million, from £6.5 million in

2019 to £41.5 million in 2020. The increase was principally due to lower investments in portfolio
purchases, offset by lower collections. Investments in portfolios reduced from £303.7 million in
2019 to £109.9 million in 2020, partly due to our preservation of cash resources as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic and partly due to our new investment model of co-investing alongside the
Fund. Collections decreased from £442.3 million in 2019 to £338.9 million in 2020 as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Impact of
_the COVID-19 pandemic.”_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased £6.9 million, or 24.7%, from £27.9 million

in 2019 to £21.0 million in 2020. This decrease was largely due to lower payments of deferred
consideration paid in connection with subsidiary acquisitions, which decreased from £12.0 million
in 2019 to £7.1 million in 2020.

Net cash generated by financing activities increased £32.8 million, from £7.5 million in

2019 to £40.3 million in 2020. This was primarily due to withdrawal of dividends in 2020 by the
Target following the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 6, 2020, the Target announced its intention
to withdraw the recommended final dividend for 2019, preserving £15.0 million of cash within the
business. No interim dividend was payable in 2020 and as a result, dividends paid reduced from
£23.1 million in 2019 to £nil in 2020.

_Cash flow for year ended 2019 compared to cash flow for year ended 2018_

Net cash generated by operating activities increased £25.5 million, from used in operating

activities of £19.0 million in 2018 to net cash generated by operating activities of £6.5 million in
2019. During 2020, cash and cash equivalents of £12.9 million (2019: £26.6 million) may be
subject to constraints depending on when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a
consolidated securitization structure awaiting a payment date. Previously, such amounts were
shown in debtors and, as such, the 2019 cash flow was re-presented to remove these amounts from
the movement in other receivables, as in the prior year they were included within this line item,
and included within cash and cash equivalents. The net cash generated by operating activities (prior
to this restatement) was £20.5 million. Prior to the restatement, net cash generated by operating
activities increased £39.5 million, from net cash used in operating activities of £19.0 million in
2018 to net cash generated by operating activities of £20.5 million in 2019. The increase was
principally due to higher collections during 2019 of £442.3 million (2018: £411.6 million) and an
increase in other receivables, partially offset by higher portfolio investments of £303.7 million
(2018: £263.4 million).


-----

Net cash used in investing activities decreased £50.4 million, or 64.4%, from £78.3 million

in 2018 to £27.9 million in 2019. This decrease was largely due to the amount of £57.0 million
paid for the acquisition of subsidiaries including Parr Credit, Europa Investimenti, Norfin and
Bergen, with only £2.9 million being incurred in 2019. See “Business—Our History and
_Development.”_

Net cash generated by financing activities decreased £145.7 million, from £153.2 million

in 2018 to £7.5 million in 2019. This was primarily due to the issuance of Existing Notes in 2018.
On March 7, 2018, Arrow Global Finance Plc issued the 2026 Notes at a coupon of 3.75% over
three-month EURIBOR and also issued £100 million additional 2024 Notes. As part of the
transaction, Arrow Global Finance Plc also redeemed its 2023 Notes. The proceeds were used to
fund the purchase price for the acquisition of Parr Credit, partially repay drawings under the Arrow
Global Revolving Credit Facility and to fund transaction costs and the redemption of the 2023
Notes.

**_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_**

We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, income taxes

and overseas taxation paid and amounts paid for the purchase of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow
to net cash from operating activities during the periods under review.

Facility, Non-Recourse Facilities, the 2024 Notes and related accrued interest, the 2025 Notes and related accrued interest and the 2026 Notes
and related accrued interest, and corporation tax debtors and creditors.

(2) See “—Capital expenditure” below.

(3) Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of our liquidity that is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS. We present
Adjusted Free Cash Flow because we believe that similar free cash flow measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and
other interested parties in evaluating similar issuers. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a measure of cash flow from
operations under IFRS or as an indicator of liquidity. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a metric used by management and is intended to be a
measure of cash flow available for our discretionary use and before any investment in portfolio acquisitions. Our presentation of Adjusted
Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as


-----

reported under IFRS. Further, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation and calculation of Adjusted Free Cash
Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

**_Borrowings_**

As of June 30, 2021, we had secured financial indebtedness of £1,271.7 million, primarily

from our three core funding sources: the Existing Notes, the Arrow Global Revolving Credit
Facility and the Non-Recourse Facilities. We also had the Miscellaneous Facilities of £5.6 million
as of June 30, 2021. The Existing Notes and the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility were or
are being redeemed or repaid and cancelled in full as part of the Transactions. Our key borrowings
subsequent to the Transactions will be the Notes, the Revolving Facility, the Non-Recourse
Facilities and the Miscellaneous Facilities. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness” for further details relating to our capitalization and indebtedness as of the dates_
indicated therein.

_Revolving Facility_

On October 6, 2021, Finco entered into a new £285.0 million (equivalent) Revolving

Facility on certain terms. The drawings under the Revolving Facility were utilized to repay the
outstanding amount under Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and upon such repayment, the
Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility was cancelled in full, in accordance with the change of
control provisions following the takeover by Bidco. As of June 30, 2021, £201.5 million was
outstanding under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility (pre-netting of transaction fees).
Upon completion of the Offering, the proceeds of the Notes will be used to repay a portion of the
Revolving Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further details. As of the Issue
Date and after giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to have drawn £55 million under the
Revolving Facility.

_Non-Recourse Facilities_

The Group has two non-recourse committed asset-backed securitization term loans, being

the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility and the Euro Non-Recourse Facility. Interest on the original
£100 million Sterling Non-Recourse Facility, which was entered into on April 30, 2019, is payable
at a rate equal to LIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 3.1% per annum and was secured
against certain UK pound sterling investment portfolios. As of June 30, 2021, the Sterling NonRecourse Facility had an outstanding balance of £54.7 million. Interest on the original €104.7
million Euro Non-Recourse Facility, which was executed on July 1, 2020 and was secured against
certain Portuguese euro investment portfolios, is payable at EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a
margin of 4.25% per annum (rising to 6% per annum if the tenor is extended beyond three years).
As of June 30, 2021, the balance outstanding on the Euro Non-Recourse Facility was €48.0 million.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further details.

_Miscellaneous Facilities_

The Group has various miscellaneous debt factoring and uncommitted overdraft facilities

provided by certain financial institutions in relation to the Target Group’s cash management and
other administrative requirements in the territories in which the Target Group operates. The


-----

Miscellaneous Facilities are non-recourse facilities. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding balance
under the Miscellaneous Facilities was £3.1 million. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for
further details.

(1) Excludes £2.5 million of costs in relation to the One Arrow program.

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we incurred £9.3 million in capital

expenditure, being £6.6 million intangible assets and £2.7 million fixed assets consistent with the
previous period. During 2020, we incurred £13.8 million in capital expenditure, being £11.4
million intangible assets, predominantly relating to IT and software license costs, and £2.5 million
fixed assets, predominantly relating to leased assets. During 2019, we incurred £13.1 million in
capital expenditure, being £11.8 million intangible assets and £1.3 million fixed assets. We expect
our capital expenditure to remain broadly stable in 2021 compared to our historical capital
expenditure in 2020 and 2019. As we continue to grow our business, particularly through our new
Fund and Investment Management business, we expect that additional costs may be incurred, such
as in the development of our new funds system, but we expect that the significant portion of such
costs to be re-charged through designated charges to the Fund.

**Contractual obligations and commercial commitments**

The following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial

commitments as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, including the repayment
of the amounts drawn under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility, the Offering of the Notes
and the use of net proceeds thereof to redeem the entire outstanding amount of the Existing Notes.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of June 30, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure of Market Risk**

Our key risks and uncertainties are managed within an established risk management

framework. Our centralized treasury function manages the market risks and report quarterly to our
Asset & Liability Committee (“ALCO”). ALCO has responsibility to provide oversight of the
treasury function, to ensure that such risks are managed within policy and appetite and that any
exceptions are reported through to the Board. We are exposed to market risk in the form of liquidity
risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk that arise in the normal course of our
business.

**_Liquidity risk management_**

Our day-to-day working capital requirements are funded by our cash and cash equivalents,

along with access to our Revolving Facility. We manage liquidity risk by monitoring a number of
metrics, including leverage, levels of our cash and headroom under our Revolving Facility,
headroom under the financial covenant within our Revolving Facility, the diversification of our
funding sources, our external credit ratings and the period to maturity of our Notes, Revolving
Facility and Non-Recourse Facilities. These metrics are reviewed on an actual historical basis, but
also, where appropriate, on a forward-looking view through our budgeting process.

This holistic review to liquidity risk is important to ensure that the risk is appropriately

managed. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our business, which led to a reduction in
Cash Collections and therefore, an increase in leverage. However, during the first quarter of 2020
at the on-set of the pandemic, we reported leverage of 3.4 times as at December 31, 2019, within
our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times. None of our Existing Notes or Arrow Global
Revolving Credit Facility outstanding at the time had a maturity date ahead of January 2024. We
had cash and headroom on our committed Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility as at March 30,
2020 of £129 million and we had good diversification of funding sources that enabled us to quickly
access additional liquidity with the drawdown under our Sterling Asset-Backed Loan of £21.0
million on April 2, 2020. The strong position ahead of the disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, together with the actions taken to preserve our liquidity resources, such as curtailing
shareholder dividends and reducing the level of portfolio investments, ensured that liquidity risk
continued to be minimized.

As a result of the disruption to collections caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we

approached our lenders under our Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility outstanding at the time
and sought a relaxation of the leverage financial covenant. On August 12, 2020, we executed an
amendment agreement with our lenders to amend the financial covenants under the Arrow Global
Revolving Credit Facility. The amendments to the financial covenants were for the period from


-----

September 2020 up to and including June 2022 and provided suitable headroom based on our
downside projections at the time, including an amendment to the maximum permitted leverage
and minimum liquidity, and transitioned to a more dynamic margin calculation. Importantly, our
lenders did not impose any restrictions on the level of portfolio acquisitions that we could make
and provided a medium-term amendment to the financial covenants, in part as the Existing Notes
were not due for repayment before 2024. The Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility was
cancelled on or about October 19, 2021 and replaced by the Revolving Facility. See “Description
_of Other IndebtednessRevolving Facility.”_

For further information on our diversified funding sources, see “Description of Other

_Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**_Foreign currency risk_**

A significant portion of our operations are in Italy, Portugal, Ireland and the Netherlands

and, as such, we are exposed to foreign exchange currency risk. The exposures created by our
operations are summarized as follows:

(a) our assets and liabilities denominated in a different currency to our base accounting
currency (i.e., pounds sterling) will be revalued on a monthly basis creating a
translation gain or loss. This primarily relates to our euro-denominated portfolios
acquired by UK legal entities, euro-denominated intra-group loans from a UK entity
to an overseas subsidiary to fund either euro-denominated portfolios or historical
acquisitions. We use euro-denominated borrowings, through our Notes and our
Revolving Facility, to ensure that positions are closely matched, thereby
minimizing the impact of any translational gains and losses;

(b) profits from our overseas operations can vary when translated to pounds sterling
for reporting purposes. It is our policy not to hedge this exposure; and

(c) cash flows arising in a different currency from our base accounting currency, such
as dividend receipts paid in euros to a UK holding company and receipts of fund
management fees. It is our policy to hedge such exposures when they are considered
highly likely and they are significant.

Furthermore, there can be impacts that do not create an exposure to our reported results.

For example, our Revolving Facility has a fixed sterling commitment and therefore, the headroom
can reduce due to market fluctuations on any euro borrowings made under the facility. Similarly,
the reported leverage may increase or decrease merely due to the conversion of our eurodenominated debt.

We have historically reduced the risk of our foreign currency exposure predominantly

through borrowing in euros under the Arrow Global Revolving Credit Facility and, less frequently,
using forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair value and nominal value of foreign exchange
contracts was nil as at December 31, 2020 and nil as at June 30, 2021.

Euro (EUR) ......................................................................................................... 21,380 21,456

**21,380** **21,456**

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on our borrowings,

principally on the Euro Floating Rate Notes offered hereby and any borrowings under our
Revolving Facility, and therefore seek to monitor and limit this exposure within an acceptable
level of risk appetite. The risk is monitored by (i) assessing the impact of a shock to interest rates,
both euro and pound sterling benchmark rates, and assessing the impact on our profits for the
current and next financial years; and (ii) assessing the profile of our fixed and floating rate debt
over the medium term. The objectives of our policy are firstly, to seek to limit the impact of a
shock to interest rates to our profits for the current and next financial years within acceptable
levels, and second, to broadly match the level of fixed rate debt, together with any interest rate
swap contracts, to an approximate profile of the maturity of our portfolio investments.

We typically use interest rate swap contracts to achieve our objective by seeking to hedge

_Interest rate sensitivity analysis_

If the interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points, it would

have led to a higher finance costs and a reduction in our profit before taxation for the following
twelve months of £(0.7) million as at December 31, 2020 and £(1.4) million as at December 31,
2019.

_Counterparty credit risk_

Counterparty credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty, such as a bank, defaults on

its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to us. The credit risk relating to financial
assets mainly concerns cash and cash equivalents held within bank accounts and any positive
mark-to-market value on any foreign currency and derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency and derivative financial instruments are transacted through banks which

are approved by our Board and are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. Cash and
cash equivalents held on our balance sheet relate to balances held in operational bank accounts
only and are held at approved banks only. We seek to minimize balances by utilizing surplus cash
to repay borrowings under our debt facilities.

**Key accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimates**

**_Key Accounting Policies_**

The key accounting policies that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements

are described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

As a result of the takeover of AGG by Bidco, we intend to prepare consolidated financial

statements for the Parent, the parent company of Bidco. The Parent, Bidco and the Issuer have
been incorporated solely for the purposes of the Acquisition. The only activities of these companies
relate to the acquisition of AGG as described above, the execution of the Revolving Facility and
the offering of the Notes hereby. As such, the only assets, liabilities, revenues and costs within
these entities relate to the costs of completion of the Transactions. We estimate that the total costs
of the Transactions will be approximately £85 million, and all or part of these costs may be paid
for with the proceeds of the Offering. See “Description of Key Performance MetricsProfit
_before and after tax (before exceptional items).”_

As such, the results presented in this Offering Memorandum are prepared on a different

basis from the results in future periods. It should be noted that none of these changes that arise
from the business combination accounting policies change cash or cash flows of the Parent or
any of its subsidiaries and as such, the accounting basis for calculating leverage, Adjusted
EBITDA and liquidity headroom will remain unchanged for future periods. Below is a list of
what we believe are the material areas where reporting in future periods may differ from the
current reported results of the Group:

1. _Goodwill: Goodwill was £269.5 million as at June 30, 2021 and is currently held_
on the balance sheet of the Group. This goodwill will no longer be reported when


-----

preparing the consolidated results of the Parent. However, the Parent will report
goodwill and acquired intangible assets as a result of the purchase of AGG.

The level of goodwill will be dependent upon the difference between the
consideration paid under the Acquisition and the fair value of the assets and
liabilities of AGG at the time of the Acquisition. This fair value will be different
from the reported assets and liabilities within the consolidated results of AGG,
which in some cases are reported at historic cost, in line with IFRS.

2. _Portfolio investment carrying value: As noted above, under our accounting for_
business combinations, the identifiable net assets acquired are measured at fair
value. This applies to all assets, such as fixed assets, and liabilities. In particular,
portfolio investments held at amortized cost and held as inventories will, under the
consolidated results of the Parent, be recognized initially at their fair value rather
than under their current historic cost accounting value. Any change to the carrying
value going forward would result in a change to the revenue recognized through the
profit and loss of the Parent’s consolidated results going forward.

As at June 30, 2021, the carrying value of portfolio investments – amortized cost,
which are recognized at historic cost was £735.4 million. As part of the disclosures
within our reported results as at June 30, 2021, we estimated the fair value of such
portfolios at £880.4 million, an uplift of £145.0 million. Fair value has been
calculated by observing the compression in market yields over time and applying
the difference between current average market IRRs for our most recent vintage,
and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach
takes into account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the
consideration of the individual characteristics of each portfolio.

As part of the acquisition accounting process, a more rigorous review of each
portfolio would need to be undertaken and, as such, the actual fair value at the
acquisition date is likely to be different to the indicative fair value estimate shown
within our historical financial disclosure information.

Any uplift to the carrying value of our portfolio investments will reduce the revenue
recognized in future periods on such portfolios within the consolidated results of
the Parent.

3. _Debt carrying value: The carrying value of our debt includes unamortized upfront_
costs of arranging the debt. As at June 30, 2021, there was £12.9 million of
unamortized debt costs relating to the Existing Notes and the Arrow Global
Revolving Credit Facility held on our balance sheet. Given the refinancing of our
debt that existed at the time of the Acquisition, it is expected that the fair value of
this unamortized debt will be minimal and hence will impact the level of goodwill
arising within the consolidated results of the Parent.

4. _Intangible amortization: The acquisition of intangible assets, which arose upon the_
acquisition of AGG by the Parent, primarily relates to customer relationships and


-----

brands. When we acquire businesses and when the Parent acquired AGG, which
has material ongoing customer relationships, whether contractual or otherwise, the
principles of IFRS 3 require that the fair value of such customer relationships must
be estimated and recognized on the balance sheet at the acquisition date. The impact
of this is to effectively reduce the goodwill recognized on acquisition. Subsequent
to the initial recognition of such assets, the assets are amortized over the expected
life of the customer relationships with us. This amortization is recognized within
operating expenses. The useful lives and carrying values of customer intangibles
are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. As such, the
creation of the customer and brand intangibles, and associated non-cash
amortization thereof, will reduce the reported consolidated profits of the Parent in
the future, although such non-cash item will be separately identifiable.

5. _Statutory reporting periods: Since the Parent was incorporated on March 29, 2021,_
it is our intention to prepare audited consolidated results of the Parent for the nine
months ended December 31, 2021. In line with accounting standards, these results
will reflect the results of AGG and its subsidiaries from the time of the Acquisition
to December 31, 2021 only. Since AGG will no longer be required to prepare
audited consolidated accounts for AGG and its subsidiaries, it will not be possible
to view statutory audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 that
incorporate the results for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2021 of
AGG and its subsidiaries. It is our intention to publish key financial information
and metrics covering the twelve months as pro-forma unaudited figures to aid
comparison.

**_Key accounting judgements_**

We regularly make judgements, when preparing our consolidated financial statements,

which affect the application of our accounting policies and our reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. As such, our actual results may differ from these judgments. The
judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting judgments are recognized
in the year in which the judgment is revised.

The following are the key accounting judgements that have been made when preparing our

financial statements:

_Classification of portfolio investment assets_

We hold the majority of our portfolio investments at amortized cost, due to the fact that we

have determined that these assets meet the SPPI criteria and are held in a ‘hold to collect’ business
model. The SPPI criteria for each portfolio are assessed at the point each portfolio is being
approved for purchase and are based on the nature of the underlying loans which are being
purchased. This determination is made for each purchase individually, unless it is a follow-on
purchase of the same or very similar assets, which have already been assessed.

With respect to the ‘hold to collect’ business model, we have determined that this is the

most appropriate IFRS 9 business model classification for its general portfolio holding activities,


-----

as although in the past a small number of portfolios have been sold outright to a third party, such
sales do not comprise a material component of our ERC at any point in time. Therefore, we believe
that such infrequent sales activity is not deemed to invalidate the ‘hold to collect’ business model
which we employ for the majority of our portfolios.

Another judgement that has been made regarding the Group’s amortized cost portfolio

assets is that they all fall within the purchased or originated credit-impaired (“POCI”)
classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made, based
on the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of our amortized cost
portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are
credit impaired in some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the
fact that they are usually purchased at a steep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit
losses to date.

For some portfolio investments, the SPPI criteria are not met, or there is an element of

subordination within the holding structure. In such instances, these portfolio investments are held
at FVTPL. Furthermore, some portfolio investments, such as those involving real estate, do not
meet the definition of a financial instrument for accounting purposes. This leads to a portion of
our portfolio investments being classified as ‘inventories’ under the scope of IAS 2.

Our co-investment alongside our Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to

be held in a different ‘business model’ than ‘hold to collect,’ as these portfolio investments are
managed primarily on a fair value basis, with reporting to senior management on the performance
of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key management remuneration being linked to the
performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the ‘business model’ of these portfolios
is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and
to sell the Portfolio Assets. As such, our co-investment alongside the Fund and other co-investment
portfolios purchased alongside other third-parties are classified as FVTPL.

_Determination of control over investees_

We hold an economic interest in a number of entities which we determine under IFRS 10,

that we do not control. As such, these entities are not consolidated into our financial statements,
but rather, the investment in such entities is recognized as a single asset within the appropriate
balance sheet classification, usually portfolio investments. Conversely, we also consolidate entities
into its financial statements which we do not have 100% ownership of, but we are judged to control
regardless.

The judgement as to whether or not we have control over an entity is taken on a case-by
case basis by management, and is firstly based on whether we can exercise any power over the
relevant activities of the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between
such power and the variability of returns that arise from the entity.

In many cases, the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply

more judgement can occur where we hold a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured
entity, as well as providing services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship
capacity. In these cases, we mainly assess the relative share of marginal variable returns which


-----

flow to third parties versus the share which flows to ourselves as a primary indicator of whether
we are exercising any power we may have to influence the variable returns of the structured entity,
either for its benefit, or for the benefit of third parties in the structure. In the case of the former,
the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter, the entity will usually not be
consolidated.

**_Key Accounting Assumptions and Estimates_**

In addition to our accounting judgements, we also regularly make estimates and

assumptions, when preparing our consolidated financial statements, that affect the application of
our accounting policies and our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. As
such, our actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised.

The following are the key accounting assumptions and estimates that have been made when

preparing our consolidated financial statements:

_Carrying value of portfolio investments_

As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of portfolio investments was £1,042.2 million

compared with £1,163.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The majority of our portfolio
investments are measured at amortized cost. However, under our business combination accounting
policies, on completion of the Acquisition, there will be a requirement to fair value our assets and
liabilities. See “Key accounting policies, judgements and assumptions and estimatesKey
_Accounting Policies.”_

Given the speed and severity of the economic changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has

brought, we further refined the method by which ERCs, and therefore portfolio valuations, are
calculated for the year ended December 31, 2020.

For earlier periods, a bottom-up approach was taken whereby each individual portfolio’s

cash flow was modelled based on a number of factors, including Balance Sheet Cash Collections
history and an array of data concerning the status of the individual loans within our portfolios, for
example account-specific Balance Sheet Cash Collections history, account statuses, property
statuses and valuations (for secured accounts), servicer history, and supporting data from third
parties such as credit files or geo-demographics. This data has then been used in conjunction with
the predicted effectiveness of any additional collection initiatives to forecast future Balance Sheet
Cash Collections for each portfolio.

These forecast Balance Sheet Cash Collections are then updated for actual Cash

Collections, before being used as the basis for the December 31 and June 30 reforecast at each
reporting date. Management believes that the nature of the current crisis has caused a temporary
dislocation in how Cash Collections will trend, based on Cash Collections data during 2020 and
into 2021. Accordingly, we have instead sought to determine how the anticipated more volatile
macroeconomic environment may impact the bottom-up portfolio-level ERC forecasts, through a
series of overlays, taking into account forecast future macroeconomic circumstances. To achieve


-----

this, each of our portfolios was first divided into a specified number of risk segments, with each
segment containing loans of a similar nature (for example, UK unsecured loans).

In addition, individually material and/or complex portfolios were also considered

separately as their own ‘segment.’ For each segment, for the most relevant macroeconomic
indicators, a range of possible future outcomes was forecast, each representing either an upside,
downside or severe downside scenario. The impact of each scenario on our future cash flows was
determined in conjunction with our internal experts in the relevant segment, considering both past
experience and knowledge about the current condition of the local environment.

Using statistical methods, a probability was also assigned to each segment-level scenario,

giving consideration to updated external macroeconomic forecasts, actual Cash Collections
performance throughout the year and local in-house knowledge. These probabilities assigned were
then used to calculate a probability-weighted ERC change for each segment, save for a small
number of individual portfolios in which management judgement was applied. The weighted
segment-level adjustments were then applied to each portfolio within each respective segment to
allow the production of portfolio-level ERC curves.

The portfolio-level ERC curves were then discounted at the appropriate rate (EIR for

amortized cost portfolios, a rate reflective of assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset for FVTPL portfolios), to obtain the revised NPV and hence carrying value of the
amortized cost and FVTPL portfolio investments. For return on equity portfolio investments, the
revised ERC curve was used to determine the net realizable value in assessing each portfolio for
potential impairment.

To assist with the understanding of how the Group has modelled future cash flows, which

ultimately drives the valuation of the portfolio investment assets, the below table shows the
probability that has been assigned to each macroeconomic scenario when preparing the cash flow
forecasts:

**Country** **Segment** **Scenario**

**Upside** **upside** **Base** **Stagnation** **Downside** **downside**

Ireland Secured 10% 10% 50% 10% 10% 10%

The key macroeconomic indicator for each segment is the level of unemployment for

unsecured and House Price Index (“HPI”) for secured. These metrics are monitored at a national
level with unemployment being the national unemployment rate, and HPI the relevant index of
house prices used to observe the relative change in house prices in each country. The corresponding
forecasts for unemployment and HPI are detailed on the following pages. Unemployment

In addition to these metrics, we also consider the impact of inflation and household

indebtedness to provide additional context regarding macroeconomic conditions, albeit we
consider these factors to have a less significant impact on performance. In addition to the scenario
modelling set out above, another key judgement that has been applied by management is the
probability weighting of each of these scenarios. The precise weightings used have been set out
above and were based on management’s judgement on how each of our scenarios aligns to the
macroeconomic forecasts provided by third party experts, as well as the view of local internal
experts in the relevant geography and asset class. Such scenarios also take into account operational
considerations that may impact Cash Collections in each individual geography, such as the
functioning of local court systems or property markets for example.

The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key

estimate/judgement in our financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by
+1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of the amortized cost and FVTPL portfolio
investments as at December 31, 2020 and as at December 31, 2019 by +/- £9.8 million and +/£11.0 million, respectively.

The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/judgement

in our financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period
would increase/(reduce) the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at December 31,


-----

2020 by £8.6 million/(£11.0) million and as at December 31, 2019 by £12.5 million/(£17.3)
million.

The carrying value of our investments directly affects our total income and, as such, the

estimation of the ERC will impact not just the carrying value of the portfolio investments, but also
our total income. See “Description of Key Statement of Profit or Loss and Other ItemsTotal
_Income.”_

_Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations_

We capitalize goodwill on the acquisition of entities. Goodwill is the excess of the

consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore, the fair value of assets
acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognized on acquisition. The determination of
the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly
for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as
acquired portfolio investments and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of
amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the
goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired entities.

_Impairment assessment of goodwill balances_

The carrying amount of goodwill held on the AGG consolidated balance sheet is £278.3

million as at December 31, 2020. Following the Acquisition, consolidated accounts will now be
prepared by the Parent and goodwill relating to the Acquisition will be created. See “Description
_of Key Balance Sheet Statement ItemsGoodwill.” In line with our accounting policies, this newly_
formed goodwill balance will need to be assessed for impairment at each annual reporting date.
The impairment assessment is expected to be carried out on a value in use basis, using discounted
cash flow models for each CGU to determine whether the ongoing value in use of each CGU is
higher than its carrying amount. For the goodwill held on the consolidated balance sheet of AGG,
no impairment was recognized as a result of the assessment performed as at December 31, 2020
or in prior accounting periods. The assessment is sensitive to the discount rate applied, and
management’s forecast future cash flows for each CGU.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

We were required to adopt IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 15 (Revenue for

_Contracts with Customers) as of January 1, 2018._

IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognizing and measuring financial assets, financial

liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39
(Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement). IFRS 9 contains a new classification and
measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are
managed and their cash flow characteristics. With respect to impairment, IFRS 9 replaces the
“incurred loss” model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking “expected credit loss” (“ECL”) model,
which has a broader scope of application than IAS 39. This has the effect of recognizing
impairment of purchased loan portfolios and loan notes earlier than at present. The estimation of
ECLs requires considerable judgement since they should include an assessment of forward-looking


-----

economic assumptions which are determined on a probability-weighted basis based on reasonable
and supportable forecasts. IFRS 9 requires an unbiased and probability weighted estimate of credit
losses by evaluation of a range of possible outcomes that incorporates forecasts of future economic
conditions. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period should utilize reasonable and
supportable information at the reporting date about past events and current conditions, in order to
inform forecasts of future economic conditions. In determining ECLs, we considered three
economic scenarios, including assumptions on unemployment, gross domestic product and
consumer price index, and weight these according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios
included a central scenario, based on the current economic environment, and upside scenario and
a downside scenario. The estimation and application of this forward-looking information required
significant judgement and was subject to appropriate internal governance and scrutiny.

Due to the nature of our portfolios and loan notes, all such assets have been classified into

Stage 3 as POCI. ECL is not recognized on initial recognition. Instead, lifetime ECL is
incorporated into the calculation of effective interest rate. Any changes in lifetime ECL after initial
recognition are recognized in profit or loss. ECL calculation for POCI assets is always based on
an ECL over the expected life of the asset.

The new impairment model, implemented on the adoption of IFRS 9, applies to financial

assets measured at amortized cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income, except for investments in equity instruments (which are measured at fair
value through profit or loss, except where an election is made to present changes in fair value in
other comprehensive income), and to contract assets. Following assessments, it was concluded
there was no material change to the classification and measurement of our financial assets, and the
vast majority continued to be accounted for at amortized cost. There was a small number of
purchased loan portfolios and loan notes with an estimated carrying value of approximately £60
million that were reclassified to being accounted for as at fair value through the profit or loss as a
result of our assessment of cash flow characteristics.

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and

when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. We do
not currently expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in significant difference in revenue
recognition compared to current revenue recognition policies.

We were required to adopt IFRS 16 (Leases) as of January 1, 2019.

At inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract

is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to
control the use of an identified asset, we use the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. At commencement
or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate consideration in the
contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price.

However, for leases of premises that we have elected not to separate non-lease components

and accounts for, the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We recognize
a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is


-----

initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any
lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred
and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the

commencement date to the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In
addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted
for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are

not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
that rate cannot be readily determined, our incremental borrowing rate. Generally, we use our
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate by
analyzing our borrowings from various external sources and make certain adjustments to reflect
the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

    - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

    - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the

index or rate as at the commencement date;

    - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

    - the exercise price under a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise,

lease payments in an optional renewal period if we are reasonably certain to exercise
an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless we are
reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. It is remeasured

when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change
in our estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if we change
our assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there
is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to

the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. We present right-of-use assets
in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other payables’ in the statement
of financial position.

In addition, we have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for

leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, including leases of IT equipment. We recognize
the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Further, none of the arrangements that we have entered into have been determined to
constitute us acting as a lessor under the definitions of IFRS 16.


-----

Other than IFRS 9, 15 and 16, no other new or proposed accounting standards, to our

knowledge, have or are expected to have a significant impact on our financial reporting. See
generally note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum for details relating to new and revised accounting standards applicable to us.

**INDUSTRY**

**Introduction**

We are an integrated asset manager with three complementary businesses, being our Fund

and Investment Management, Asset Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet businesses,
operating across the European alternative asset management, debt purchasing and servicing
industries. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Our Business Model.”_

Our Fund and Investment Management business, on behalf of LP investors in the Fund,

and our Balance Sheet business acquire a broad range of portfolios, including, but not limited to,
unsecured consumer loans (such as defaulted or non-performing credit card or personal loan debt),
secured consumer loans (such as defaulted residential mortgage debt), defaulted commercial loans
(such as defaulted commercial mortgage debt and unsecured commercial loans in a bankruptcy
where the recovery may be realization of business assets, cash in court, tax credits and real estate)
and real estate (such as residential or commercial properties). We currently acquire portfolios
originated in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands. The main source of such
portfolios is the European NPL and other non-core asset markets, acquired in both the primary and
secondary markets. Our Asset Management and Servicing business services assets similar to those
acquired by our Fund and Investment Management and Balance Sheet businesses, either on their
behalf or behalf of third parties.

In addition, since we acquire portfolios on behalf of LP investors, through our Fund and

Investment Management business, the dynamics of the private credit fundraising market are
important for us.

**The European NPL market**

The European NPL market (including the UK) is substantial in size. Following the global

financial crisis in 2008, NPLs in the European financial systems peaked at approximately €1.2
trillion. While NPLs had decreased to roughly half of that figure by the end of 2019, stress tests
on banks by the ECB suggest that NPLs could reach a new peak at roughly €1.4 trillion as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented economic and social challenges.

In the ten years following the global financial crisis, NPLs with a face value of

approximately €700 billion traded through portfolio sales. Even with the unprecedented slowdown
in transactions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that approximately €78 billion
of NPLs traded through portfolio sales in 2020. In 2021, an estimated €30 billion has traded so far
with a further €70 billion in the pipeline for the remainder of the year, bringing the total close to
2019 levels. Transactions worth approximately €100 billion are expected to trade in 2022.

European NPL volumes peaked at approximately €1.2 trillion following the global

financial crisis and decreased to approximately €600 billion by the end of 2019. Despite the
COVID-19 pandemic, the EBA’s Q4 2020 Risk Dashboard indicates that the total stock of
European bank NPLs, including the UK, decreased over the year to approximately €528 billion at
the end of 2020. This decrease is likely attributable to COVID-19 related loan moratoria and other
relief measures.


-----

We believe that the economic and social challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic

will lead to a material increase in European NPL volumes, with the ECB’s stress tests suggesting
that NPLs could peak at approximately €1.4 trillion, approximately €200 billion higher than the
previous peak.

**_NPL volumes and forecasts by country_**

NPL volumes vary by country. Northern European countries were quicker to work through

their NPL stocks following the global financial crisis in 2008, whereas many Southern European
countries have not worked through their legacy NPL stocks, despite being major sellers in recent
years, and as a result have high NPL volumes, on a relative basis.

NPL volumes in our core markets are large and expected to increase materially as a result

of the economic effects brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The chart below illustrates the
current stock and anticipated rise in NPL volumes in various European countries following the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_of report: Navigating European distressed markets - European debt sales 2021) – 41% increase as compared_
_with Q3 2020._

**_NPL transaction activity_**

Since 2014, NPL transaction activity has been robust with a minimum of €100 billion of

NPLs by face value trading every year up to and including 2019.

Most NPL transaction activity was significantly curtailed during the second quarter of 2020

as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout Europe. In the second half of 2020,
approximately €54 billion of NPLs were traded as processes that were initially put on hold returned
to the market, bringing total transaction activity to approximately €78 billion for 2020, across 103
transactions. This marked a major slowdown in activity from previous years, with volumes traded
down 35% below the total for 2019 of approximately €120 billion and 62% down from the highwater mark in 2018, when over €200 billion was traded. According to a 2021 report by Deloitte,


-----

as of June 2021, approximately €30 billion has traded with a further €70 billion in the pipeline for
the remainder of the year, bringing the total close to 2019 levels, and (according to a PwC report)
with approximately €100 billion expected to trade in 2022.

**_NPL transaction activity by country_**

Historically, NPL transaction activity has been highest in those countries that had material

NPL volumes and quickly put in place the right infrastructure to work through their NPLs
following the global financial crisis in 2008. Countries that did not have material NPL volumes
following the global financial have not been very active in the NPL portfolio sale market.

Our core markets have been and continue to be some of the most active in NPL portfolio

sales.

_Source: Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021, page 8._

**_Secondary market activity_**

The transaction activity in our core markets (being, the UK, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands

and Portugal) since 2014 has been very high with over €500 billion of primary NPL portfolio sales
across all markets. The main acquirers of portfolios are closed-end funds and, as such, this primary
market activity in turn creates a very large and attractive secondary market at the end of such
closed-end fund’s life. Based on management estimates, we believe that the main acquirers of NPL
portfolios will generally hold a portfolio for approximately six years on average and will expect to
collect approximately half of the amounts outstanding in that time.

Such closed-end funds will seek to sell their portfolios at the end of their fund life, which,

given the primary activity building through to 2018, will lead to the creation of a significant
secondary market that is expected to rise through until 2024. In many cases, the incumbent
servicer, such as ourselves, is best placed to acquire the portfolio in the secondary market, given
its knowledge of the portfolios performance and the frictional costs associated with changing a
servicer. The chart below is a summary of the activity by year in the primary markets within each
of the territories in which we operate, and it provides an indication of the upcoming flow into the
secondary market.

**Market participants**

**_Sellers_**

There are a wide variety of sellers in the European NPL market ranging from banks,

national agencies (sometimes referred to as bad banks), telecommunications providers, utility
companies, motor finance, store credit, and home retail debt originators and, most recently, public
sector entities. However, the market is highly concentrated, with a few sellers conducting the
majority of transactions. The top 20 sellers accounted for approximately 74% of portfolio sales by
face value in 2019, 2020 and 2021 to-date. Of the top 20, 18 are banks.

**_Buyers_**

Similarly, there are a wide variety of buyers in the European NPL market, ranging from

alternative fund managers (e.g., specialist credit funds, hedge funds, etc.), national agencies, banks
and specialist debt purchasers and debt collectors. Among the top ten buyers of NPLs in Europe
since the start of 2019, four Italian buyers – AMCO, Credito Fondiario, doValue and Illimity –
accounted for over 48% of the total debt purchases in that year.

_of FIM FuM of €4.3bn._


-----

**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**

As a result of government imposed containment measures to curb the spread of the

COVID-19 virus, activity within the European NPL market was significantly curtailed during the
first half of 2020, with activity increasing during the second half of that year, driven largely
through the use of government-guaranteed securitization schemes.

As a result of government support measures and the expected time lag before the effects of

the initial economic shock, defaults and insolvencies are still at a moderate level across Europe.
Many stakeholders are awaiting the impact of the unwinding of government support measures
(e.g., the end of various loan moratoria). If the recovery is slow and protracted, a rise in credit
losses could reasonably push NPL stocks in some countries close to or over the levels reached
during the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. There is also a real risk that a so called “zombie”
class of borrowers will emerge, being those who have been propped up financially by government
and other COVID-19-related support measures but who are susceptible to defaulting on their loans
after such government support has been withdrawn.

The ECB has acknowledged that most banks are adopting prudent financial projections in

their reporting since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as consensus of a stronger than expected
recovery has grown, the ECB has stressed continued caution ahead of releasing any provisions. A
particular concern is the steady growth of Stage 2 loans, a leading indicator for future NPLs that,
according to the EBA, rose to 9.1% of total loans across Europe in December 2020 from 6.5% in
December 2019, and rose to 13.4% of total loans in the UK in December 2020 from 7.7% in
December 2019. This area will be a key focus of potential stress as government measures come to
an end. With even a subset of these loans souring to NPLs, banks would face a significant challenge
and see a material rise in NPL volumes. According to a Deloitte report titled Deleveraging Europe
_(June 2021), banks in the UK will continue to assess their post-Brexit and post-COVID-19_
pandemic requirements, and we expect to see several non-core disposals over the course of 2021
and into 2022, as banks accelerate plans to wind down and deleverage non-core assets, whether
through equity sales or pure asset trades.

According to the EBA’s September 2020 survey, more than 75% of European banks were

expecting a deterioration in asset quality for corporate portfolios as well as consumer credit. Unlike
the global financial crisis in 2007/2008, the exposures with the greatest stress are concentrated in
sectors such as retail, leisure and hospitality, where borrowers have been most directly impacted
by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among the largest banks in Europe, approximately €118.1 billion of provisions were set

aside during 2020, doubling the €54.5 billion set aside in 2019, as banks frontloaded their expected
credit losses. Of this total, €76.5 billion of loan losses were provisioned in the first half of the year,
with a substantial drop in the second half of the year to €41.6 billion, as economic forecasts showed
slight signs of a recovery.

The average NPL ratio across EBA banks fell in Q4 2020 by 20bps to 2.6%. This lower

NPL ratio reflects both a reduction in NPL volumes and also an increase in total loans and
advances, including those through government-backed loan support schemes launched in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our Operations—Our


-----

_business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been and may continue to_
_be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.” and “—Changes in the economic and/or_
_political environment and/or the climate in the markets in which we operate may have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_

**_Impact of loan moratoria and other measures_**

Over the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, €900 billion of European loans received
support through EBA-eligible moratoria. The chart below shows that of these, 70% were granted
by banks in France, Spain and Italy, making these jurisdictions potential hotspots as relief
measures are unwound.

_Sources: 1. Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021, Italy: page 12. 2. Q1 2021 EBA Risk Dashboard report, page_
_39 for Ireland data as of December 2020._

In Q4 2020, loans under EBA-eligible moratoria almost halved, decreasing from €587

billion at the end of Q3 2020 to €318 billion, with exposures to non-financial companies declining
the most. Meanwhile, the proportion of Stage 2 loans under non-expired moratoria continued an
upward trend, standing at 26.4% in Q4 2020, up by 6.2 percentage points from Q3 2020. Although
it is still early to draw conclusions about asset quality, it is noteworthy that the proportion of Stage
2 loans under moratoria is almost three times higher than the 9.1% ratio for total loans across
Europe, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria expire.

_Source: Deloitte, Deleveraging Europe June 2021, Italy: page 13._


-----

During the same time, the proportion of loans under public guarantee schemes across EBA

banks increased by 19% reaching €343 billion during Q4 2020, up from €289 billion at the end of
Q3 2020. According to EBA’s Q4 2020 Risk Dashboard, approximately 40% of the loans subject
to public guarantee schemes have a residual maturity of two to five years.

**The debt collection and debt servicing market**

Generally, the debt collection or debt servicing business model consists of the provision of

debt collection services on behalf of a third-party (typically the debt originator). Debt servicers
usually receive a fee related either to the face value of the debt portfolio under management or on
the basis of the collections generated. Debt servicers can provide third-party collection services
for either performing or non-performing debt. The latter can be particularly burdensome for debt
originators, as non-performing debt tends to entail significant efforts both in terms of time and
special skills and resources required. As a result, debt originators often decide to outsource debt
collection functions to specialized debt servicers as the latter have dedicated competencies,
experience and more appropriate structures to perform these activities. Additionally, debt
originators may decide to externalize some of their accounts to debt servicers to compare their
internal recovery performance with that of a specialized third-party provider.

There are a number of business models in the market:

_Third-party servicing only_

Collection and servicing of portfolios on behalf of a third-party, typically, a fund, a bank

or a utility company, without any direct investment in the underlying loan portfolio.

_Debt purchasing and collection_

Direct investment in or acquisition of an underlying portfolio from a third-party debt

originator and collection and servicing of acquired portfolios for the debt purchaser’s benefit.

_Hybrid debt purchasing, collection and third-party servicing_

A hybrid combination of debt purchasing and collection whereby a debt purchaser acquires,

collects and services portfolios for their own benefit but also provides its expert debt collection
and servicing capabilities to third-parties creating a more diversified and stable business model.

_Fund management_

Direct investment in or acquisition of an underlying portfolio on behalf of other investors.

Fund managers typically employ the services of one of the above business models to collect and
service the portfolios they have acquired and earn management and performance fees from their
investors.

_Integrated asset manager_

We are an integrated asset manager operating in the European NPL market that combines

debt purchasing, debt servicing and fund management, where the three business models are


-----

complementary to one another, fully integrated and able to maximize the synergistic benefits
across their revenue channels and cost base. See “Business—Our businesses.” During the first half
of 2021, our debt purchasing, debt servicing and fund management businesses yielded 54%, 33%
and 13% of our total revenue, respectively.

**_Specialization and standardization_**

The European debt collection and debt servicing market is idiosyncratic with varying

operating and regulatory models across countries and asset classes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Regulation of our Business.” Increasingly, market participants need to be able to_
provide highly specialized end-to-end services in the management, collection and servicing of loan
portfolios including ancillary services connected to the core servicing activity, such as due
diligence, legal, data governance and data-quality, real estate, across a number of geographies and
asset classes.

Despite some of the jurisdictional differences and increasing specialization, the European

debt collection and servicing industry is also becoming more standardized and integrated as
markets mature, competition increases and regulators begin to play a larger role.

Regulators, such as the EBA, are attempting to harmonize jurisdictional differences in the

market and to promote cross-border firms through regulation. In the first quarter of 2020, the EBA
published an update to the Credit Servicers Directive, which is based on the best practice observed
in Ireland and Spain, countries hardest hit by the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. The Directive
aims to blend best practices and level the playing field for competition, to encourage new market
entrants and deepen liquidity of the NPL market. Recommendations include a passporting regime,
data standardization and infrastructure. This will likely result in the standardization of processes,
operations, data requirements, etc. across the European market. All of this means that operators
need to have broad capabilities so that they are able to operate across a number of geographies and
asset classes allowing them to build an established and scalable presence to better compete in the
market.

While increased regulation will undoubtedly increase the cost of doing business, operators

are already one step ahead and are investing heavily in technology and people to enhance
operational effectiveness and flexibility in order to maintain and improve their margins and
financial performance.

As the debt collection and servicing market in Europe continues to transform, with debt

collectors and servicers investing to meet market demand and exploit growth opportunities, it is
likely that in the medium to long term, small players may merge with large international servicing
platforms, thereby leveraging strong economies of scale, competence and commercial presence,
contributing to market concentration.

Overall, the highly competitive European debt collection and servicing market is likely to

result in firms specializing in markets where they outperform the market. The larger operators will
continue to manage large NPL portfolios and securitization, while smaller operators will focus on
local markets for secondary and tertiary portfolios.


-----

A trend that continues to gain prominence in the European debt collection and servicing

market is the increasing willingness of banks and other lenders to outsource their debt collection
and servicing to specialist providers not only for their NPL portfolios but across their performing
portfolios as well. The COVID-19 pandemic has put banks under a lot of operational pressure,
coupled with the dynamics playing out in the broader macroeconomic environment, banks’
margins and profitability are also under increasing pressure. As a result, banks are increasingly
focusing on their core competencies in the origination of loans and looking to others with core
competencies in debt collection and servicing to replace some of their in-house functions where
they do not consider themselves to have an advantage. See “Business—Our Key Strengths—
_Attractive market with strong growth drivers.” This creates a very material and attractive_
opportunity for debt collectors and servicers with a desire to expand in this part of the market
which typically comes with higher quality recurring revenues without the capital and liquidity
intensity of a debt purchasing business.

**Alternative investment management**

Private debt emerged as a core alternative asset class after the 2007/2008 global financial

crisis and has once again proved its value and importance in supporting businesses and the
economy as a whole in a volatile year, with the COVID-19 driven slowdown driving total assets
to new highs. According to data from Preqin, AUM increased to $887 billion as of June 2020,
making private debt the third largest among the private capital asset classes, followed by private
equity and real estate.

Funds continued to flow into the asset class as private debt investments offered higher

returns as compared to public debt investments given the low interest rate environment in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The $118 billion raised across 200 private debt funds in 2020 was
approximately 10% down on both measures from 2019, though almost a quarter of funds raised
125% or more of their initial targets. Undrawn commitments stood at $320 billion as of December
2020, up 19% from a year prior. A combination of reduced M&A and surplus liquidity in other
debt pools slowed investment and deployment rates. Increasing competition and the amount of
capital chasing deals will likely put pressure on returns across the asset class, although
opportunities for higher returns exist in more value-added strategies, such as NPLs or distressed
debt.

Private debt is no longer considered a niche product Preqin has reported that approximately

81% of global LP investors expect to increase their allocation to alternative investments, including
private debt. In particular, distressed debt and special situations have been an area of growth for
most private credit managers. The proportion of capital allocated to the two latter strategies has
been increasing over the last ten years, up from 16% in 2009 to 40% in 2020. Distressed debt AUM
increased by $9 billion over 2020, driven by a 15% increase in un-deployed capital. While the
increase in commitments was due in part to expectations of a surge in distressed and restructuring
deals, emergency government stimulus measures and government guaranteed loan facilities
prevented, or at least delayed, distress for many customers and companies, as previously described.

According to a 2020 Global Private Debt report by Pitchbook, our inaugural fund raise for

the Fund ranked as the third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the
fourth largest private credit raise in Europe. Further, our inaugural fund raise for the Fund ranked


-----

as the largest inaugural fundraise in private debt globally in 2020 based on the information
available to us. See “Business—Our Key Strengths—Attractive market with strong growth
_drivers.”_

As the asset class has grown and competition has increased, aggregate returns have trended

downwards but remain attractive relative to other fixed-income markets. Direct lending, which
offers greater security, generated a median IRR of 8.3% for vintage years 2008 to 2017, with a
standard deviation of just 5.0%, according to data from Preqin. Distressed debt returns have been
more varied over the same period, with a standard deviation of 9.7%, but a higher return of 9.2%.
Investors can choose the point on the risk-return spectrum that best fits their mandates and needs.

Overall, as illustrated in the chart below, investors across the board plan to increase their

exposure to private debt relative to their current exposure.

_Source: Preqin, Preqin Global Private Debt Report 2021, page 40._

The majority of investors interested in the private debt asset class are, perhaps

unsurprisingly, based in North America with European investors a clear but distant second as a
proportion of all investors, as shown in the chart below.

_Source: Preqin, Preqin Global Private Debt Report 2021, page 40._

These trends are primarily driven by the returns available in the private debt market,

notably distressed debt markets such as the European NPL market. It is common for these markets
to outperform other comparable investments, particularly after periods of economic stress. This
was evident following the global financial crisis in 2008 and a similar outperformance is expected


-----

following the COVID-19 pandemic. Even on a simple average basis, the returns generated by debt
purchasers and collectors typically outperform other comparable investments by some margin. For
example, as illustrated in the chart below, our performance by vintage year outperforms the Euro
high yield index. See “Business—Our Key Strengths—Strong track record of being a leading
_European investor and asset manager.”_

**_Market participants: fund and asset managers_**

As previously described, there are a large number of participants in the European NPL

market. See “—Market participants.” Fund or asset managers are a subset of the broader universe
of market participants and they include:

_Global debt funds_

These are large funds with a global presence, typically focused on investing only with

reliance on others for their debt collection and servicing. Based on our past experience, global debt
funds will normally invest in excess of €150 million in a typical transaction. Key participants
include PIMCO, CarVal, Oaktree, Cerberus, Blackstone, Fortress, KKR, LoneStar, among others.

_Local (European) debt funds_

These are large funds with a more local presence. They also typically focus on investing

only and rely on others for their debt collection and servicing capabilities. Based on our past
experience, local European debt funds will normally invest between €50 million and €100 million
in a typical transaction. As set out in the chart below, key participants include AnaCap, M&G,
Chenavari, Deutsche Bank, Patron Capital Partners, among others.


-----

_Note: Prepared based on Company information and estimates._

Our Fund and Investment Management business targets transactions of less than €50

million, therefore not directly competing with the global debt funds or local (European) debt funds.
In addition, we provide debt collection and servicing capabilities to over half of the fund of asset
managers participating in the European NPL market and a number of them have also invested with
us. See “Business—Current Trends—NPL and non-core asset market dynamics.”

Netherlands, Italy and Ireland. As of June 30, 2021, we had £4.8 billion of FUM, £1,028 million
in portfolio investments, £1,572 million 84-month ERC, £1,733 million 120-month ERC, and, in
the six months ended June 30, 2021, generated Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the amount of £90.7
million.

We operate as an integrated asset manager, a unique model with three operating divisions

that provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. See “—Our businesses” below and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our
_Business Model.” Our model focuses on generating higher levels of capital-light revenue and, as_
such, is a comparatively less capital-intensive model than many other businesses that operate in
our sector. Our three operating divisions are detailed below:

1. _Fund and Investment Management: Our Fund and Investment Management_
business invests third-party committed capital on behalf of our clients and includes
the management of our inaugural discretionary closed-end fund, Arrow Credit
Opportunities, with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, together with Norfin,
Europa Investimenti and Sagitta;

2. _Asset Management and Servicing: Our Asset Management and Servicing platforms_
service and manage collections and other activities related to portfolio investments,
on behalf of both our Fund and Investment Management business and our Balance
Sheet business, as well as third-party clients. We have built market-leading
positions, niche-dominant platforms and competitive servicing platforms, with
expertise in consumer, real estate, mortgage and SME NPLs and non-core asset
servicing across the five jurisdictions in which we operate; and

3. _Balance Sheet: Our Balance Sheet business invests our own capital. Since the_
deployment of the Fund in 2020, our investments have typically been made by way
of a co-investment alongside the Fund, via a 100% owned Jersey partnership,
Arrow SMA. Going forward, we expect the Balance Sheet business to function
primarily for the purpose of co-investment activities alongside the Fund as well as
any future funds. We may, however, continue to make direct investments through
this business for certain strategic reasons. The Balance Sheet business also
incorporates the financial performance of the back book portfolio investments made
prior to the launch of the Fund.

Our businesses provide strong synergistic benefits to one another. Our Fund and

Investment Management business, benefiting from our 15-year track record of delivering attractive
risk-adjusted returns, invests on behalf of our Balance Sheet business, with typically 25% coinvestment in new portfolio investments alongside the Fund, and approximately 71% of these
portfolio investments are currently serviced by our Asset Management and Servicing platforms.


-----

We identify, acquire and service a wide range of secured and unsecured defaulted and non
core loan and real estate portfolios primarily from financial institutions, such as banks, institutional
fund investors and specialist lenders, playing an active role in helping financial institutions reduce
their balance sheets and re-capitalize in order to increase mainstream lending. By purchasing and
managing NPLs and other non-core assets, we provide valuable capital and expertise to a growing
European market.

Our purpose is to help build better financial futures for our customers, clients,

communities, employees and other stakeholders. As such, great importance is placed on achieving
fair outcomes for customers through affordable repayment programs and helping them improve
their credit score. We believe that we are one of the leading providers of debt purchase and
receivables management solutions in the territories in which we operate.

Through our platforms we have developed local knowledge of acquiring and servicing

NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive European markets. We offer a differentiated and
diversified European NPL strategy by leveraging our deep local expertise across the five key
European jurisdictions in which we operate. Our relevant track record and experience having
operated in each of our core markets for a long time as well as our familiarity with each asset class
provides us with a competitive advantage that is supported by local and experienced
“on-the-ground” teams. In addition, our presence in these jurisdictions enables us to target smaller
transactions in more sophisticated granular assets where local knowledge provides a competitive
advantage and supports the creation of relationships with debt originators, enabling origination of
off-market deals (i.e., deals not acquired through a process involving a competitive bid or an
auction-like process).

Our ability to meet our targets and deliver consistently high IRR on our portfolio

investments is premised on several factors including our experienced investment professionals,
our local expertise in acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across attractive
European markets, our strong origination capabilities with broad reach enabling us to acquire a
high level of off-market deals and our leading data analytics capabilities. Our proprietary database
incorporates more than 15 years of collection and payment data, over 1,000 deals underwritten
since our inception, 10 million customer accounts and over 10,000 of underlying properties across
multiple geographies. As we accelerate our movement towards a capital-light strategy, which
focuses more on the growth of the Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and
Servicing businesses, and less on our Balance Sheet business, this will result in a change in our
financial characteristics. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Our Business Model.”_

As part of this shift, it is our intention that our integrated fund manager business model

delivers:

    - an increase in FUM, with a similar or reduced level of portfolio investments held by

our Balance Sheet business;

    - an increase in the proportion of the earnings of the business derived from our capital
light businesses;


-----

    - an ability to target higher return on capital invested through a reduced use of our own

balance sheet to provide returns; and

    - an increase in cash generation as capital-light revenues grow and less cash is required

for re-investment in our own balance sheet assets, with a concomitant ability to delever the business.

To support our transition to a capital-light strategy, we will leverage our strong track record

and experience in working with partners through our historic co-investments as well as our longstanding relationships with many of the largest institutional investors in the market. The Fund
represented the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit
fundraise in special situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in
Europe. Our track record of generating superior returns during economic dislocation combined
with LP investors’ demand for private debt strategies provides a strong platform to continue to
raise private funds for yield-seeking investors and our transition into a more profitable capitallight model.

**Our Key Strengths**

We believe we benefit from the following key strengths:

**_Attractive market with strong growth drivers._**

We are a leading European investor and asset manager in the non-performing and non-core

assets sector principally operating in the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy and Ireland, with a
15-year track record of delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Debt originators generally use debt sales as a method for managing the economic,

regulatory and commercial aspects of continued ownership of defaulted loans and non-core assets
and to accelerate capital release for debts that are already fully or heavily provisioned. The debt
purchase and debt servicing industry is a significant component of the debt recovery process in
many markets and provides an attractive solution for debt originators facing increasing capital and
liquidity regulatory requirements, thereby ultimately benefiting customers. See “Industry—The
_debt collection and debt servicing market.” Our business model is designed to benefit from_
economic dislocation, which leads to an increase in the generation of non-performing and noncore assets. Even prior to the recent economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our
addressable market was very large, at approximately €1.0 trillion. Over half of these assets still sit
on bank balance sheets and will need to be sold in due course into the capital markets, where the
largest investors are often distressed debt funds. See “Industry—Market participants” and
“Industry—Alternative investment management—Market participants: fund and asset managers.”
Although these assets are created continually, the rise in the level of NPLs is closely tied to periods
of economic downturn. This trend was evident following the global financial crisis in 2007 and
2008, where an extremely large number of NPLs were created. The economic dislocation resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic is already resulting in historically high bank provisioning for bad
loans, which we expect will begin to be sold in significant volumes in the coming years. See
“Industry—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” Our current internal forecast, based on our
analysis of bank provisions and forecast defaults, suggests to us that the economic impact of the


-----

COVID-19 pandemic will lead to an increase of approximately 50% in our addressable market.
This equates to approximately €500 billion of additional NPLs having been or being created on
bank balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2020, the non performing exposures (“NPE”) volume in EU banks

(including the UK) decreased to €528 billion (compared to €584 billion in December 2019), with
the year over year drop primarily driven by a significant increase in the support measures
implemented to soften the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NPL transaction activity was
muted during 2020, marking a slowdown from previous years (total transaction activity of €77.8
billion, down 35% compared to 2019 and down 62% compared to 2018). We believe the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic will increase transaction activity in 2021, which will in turn create
new market opportunities. ECB 2020 stress tests suggest that NPLs levels could reach €1.4 trillion
once COVID-19 related financial relief measures are withdrawn (as compared to a €1.2 trillion
peak in 2015). See “ Industry—The European NPL _market.”_

Further, our presence within some of the largest European NPL jurisdictions, being Italy,

UK, the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland, puts us in a position to benefit from what we believe
will be the greatest market prospect for non-performing assets since the global financial crisis in
2007/2008. The volume of NPLs in our primary markets is significant, as illustrated below:

_Sources: Company information, ECB, EBA Risk Dashboard, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPL_
_market._

Prior to the current economic dislocation, European banks’ NPL ratios had only just begun

to approach the levels targeted by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”) and the ECB. This
had followed significant regulatory pressure for banks to recognize impaired assets and
subsequently deleverage on an expedited basis. The result was a period of transformational
European bank balance sheet restructuring that led to over €700 billion of assets being sold from
bank balance sheets into the capital markets. We anticipate that the wave of new non-performing
assets that is projected to be created following the current COVID-19-related economic dislocation
will continue to mean that regulation is likely to prioritize bank deleveraging, resulting in another
large wave of non-performing asset sales in the coming years. See “Industry—The impact of the
_COVID-19 pandemic.” In addition to presenting investment opportunities, increased deleveraging_
by European banks is also expected to present significant asset servicing opportunities for our
Asset Management and Servicing business, which we believe we are well positioned to take
advantage of. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and
_standardization.”_

The overall declining trend in total EU NPL volumes during 2020 has been driven by the

relief measures adopted to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

Over the period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, €900 billion of European loans received
support through EBA-eligible moratoria. Our forward outlook is foreseen by the increase in Stage
2 loans (9.1% in December 2020 as compared to 6.5% in December 19). The proportion of Stage
2 loans under moratoria is 26.4%, emphasizing the potential downside risks once the moratoria
expire. The chart below illustrates the large proportion of non-expired Stage 2 loans under
moratoria.

_Sources: EBA Risk Dashboard, KPMG Navigating European distressed markets - European debt sales 2021, Deloitte,_

_Deleveraging Europe June 2021._

When government measures and moratoria come to an end, even a subset of these loans

souring to NPL would cause banks to face a significant challenge, with a material rise in NPLs
volumes, thereby creating market opportunities for new contract wins and investments. According
to market consensus, the new flows will push banks to react with significant and prompt disposal
processes, with the aim of remaining in line with their NPL maximum holding levels. According
to PwC’s July 2021 report on the Italian NPL Market, up to €100 billion of distressed credits are
expected to flow in the next 24-30 months in Italy alone, one of the largest NPL markets in Europe
and one of our key markets.

We are also highly active in the growing secondary market including purchasing NPLs and

other non-core assets already serviced by our own platforms. Asset sales to NPL and other noncore asset buyers have grown dramatically in recent years in our key markets, suggesting a large
secondary market. A typical non-performing asset portfolio has a long life, with cash collections
often generated for over ten years. The majority of the over €700 billion of assets that have been
sold by European banks in recent years have been purchased by large distressed asset funds. These
asset funds are the largest buyers of non-performing assets in the market. Non-performing assets
are typically held in a closed-end fund structure and then sold at the end of that fund’s life. Based
on our analysis of previous transactions in the market, we estimate that an additional €300 billion
of NPLs will be generated in the market over the next four years. A large number of these NPLs
already sit on our servicing platforms, providing us with a unique pipeline of potential investment
opportunities, the performance of which can be forecast with a degree of certainty. This greatly
enhances risk-adjusted returns should we elect to purchase such assets, which we often do. Our
significant estimated secondary sale market in our geographies is illustrated in the chart below.


-----

_Sources: Company data; PwC, Deloitte and KPMG market reports on European NPLs market._

Fundraising from LP investors is also an important dynamic for our development and our

offering is highly attractive to the growing number of LP investors looking to allocate to private
debt. In fact, approximately 81% of the LP investors surveyed indicated that they expected to
increase their allocation to alternative investments, including private debt strategies, to more than
double the current levels over the next five years from 2% to 5%, according to a 2020 Preqin article
regarding the future of alternatives in 2025. Our 2020 fundraise of the Fund represented one of the
more successful fundraises of 2020, with the largest first time fundraise in private debt globally,
third largest credit fundraise in special situations globally and fourth largest private equity
fundraise in Europe. See “Industry—Alternative investment management.” The fundraising took
place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created various operational issues, including, among
others, that LP investors were unable to conduct in-person due diligence in respect of the Fund
Manager. However, despite these unprecedented operational hurdles, we successfully facilitated
interactions with over 100 LP investors throughout the Fund’s fundraising process and we believe
that such interactions have led to the formation of a strong pipeline of potential LP investors for
future fundraising.

There is also an increasing propensity for banks and other debt originators to outsource

their arrears or defaulted accounts collection activities which are not considered a core competency
for them. See “See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and
_standardization.” However, collection activities remain a core competency for our Asset_
Management and Servicing business. This shift to outsourcing collection activities has increased
given the COVID-19 pandemic and is an additional market development that we believe will be
beneficial for our Asset Management and Servicing business. Throughout 2020, we secured a
record 26 new contract wins, a further 11 new contracts in the first half of 2021 and we believe
that we are well placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner to financial
institutions.

**_Strong track record of being a leading European investor and asset manager._**

We have a strong track record of delivering superior returns, even during periods of

economic dislocation, which has provided us with the strong platform to transition to our integrated
asset manager model and raise funds from yield-seeking LP investors in the Fund. We believe that


-----

the following five factors have been critical in establishing our track record of delivering high IRR
on our portfolio investments:

    - our people with significant experience and a deep bench of management experience;

    - local know-how of acquiring and servicing NPLs and other non-core assets across

attractive European markets;

    - strong origination capabilities with broad reach allowing us to acquire a high level of

off-market deals;

    - leading data analytics capabilities, which enable us to underwrite portfolios with

accuracy; and

    - experience in capital partnering where we have regularly partnered with third-party

funds as a minority investor.

Our track record has delivered a 17% Net Deal IRR since 2010 (despite the ERC write

down as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic), including the track record of acquired businesses.
Our performance by vintage year, shown in the chart below, has driven the results of our Balance
Sheet business and also presents a compelling risk/return proposition for LP investors with
consistent outperformance against relevant benchmarks, such as the high yield index, as illustrated
below:

_Source: Company information._

Our differentiated origination strategy targets high levels of off-market deals, leveraging

off of our strong local presence and the ability to provide asset expertise on a granular basis. During
2020, based on our calculations, 74% of our total deals were acquired off-market, where deals tend
to be smaller (€5 to €40 million investments) and typically deliver higher returns. Such
opportunities are only generated from our deep market connections and experienced in-country
NPL and non-core asset operational teams. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Portfolio investments.” The benefit of our differentiated origination strategy is_
illustrated by the chart below, showing an incremental 5% increase to the Net Deal IRR of


-----

off-market deals (18% as of June 30, 2021) compared to on-market transactions (13% as of June
30, 2021) executed through competitive tender processes.

Our track record was impacted by the ERC write down in the first half of 2020 with an

overall 2% reduction in the average Net Deal IRR (all deals since 2010) from December 2019 to
December 2020. However, the recovery is already underway, driven by the over-performance in
actual collections against the ERC and the returns achieved on more recent vintages has already
led to a 1% Net Deal IRR recovery.

_Source: Company information and internal calculations._

Furthermore, we have strong actual cash realization, and therefore, we have demonstrable

evidence that our actual cash collections performance is in line with our underwriting assumptions
at the current point in time. As of June 30, 2020, we had realized above 100% of expected cash
receipts, per our underwriting curves, in eight out of twelve years (i.e., 2010 to 2021). Our 2017
vintage had two large underperforming deals as a result of collection challenges caused by the
counterparty’s bankruptcy and systems integration challenges and our 2018 and 2019 vintages
have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in court closures and therefore
impacted our ability to make cash collections. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.” However, given the over-performance against_
the current forecast ERC, there is opportunity for recovery of these vintages over time. Notably,
the 2020 and 2021 vintages show strong cash recovery of 230% and 296% respectively. The strong
performance of our vintages is illustrated by the chart below.


-----

_Source: Company information._

The Net Deal IRR of the 2020 vintage as of December 31, 2020 was 18%. Given the over
performance on actual collections together with reforecast ERC as of June 30, 2021, the Net Deal
IRR for the 2021 vintage has increased to 21%. Given the economic uncertainty brought about by
the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain cautious and have adopted a conservative approach to our
investment strategy and underwriting. As such, the 2021 vintage has been underwritten at a 16%
Net Deal IRR. However, there is opportunity for the 2021 vintage to outperform, particularly given
that actual collections to June 30, 2021 are 296% of the expected collections at underwriting for
that period.

Further, a smaller deal size ensures that our risks are well spread and of the over 1,000

deals with which we have been involved since 2010 to June 30, 2021, the investment loss on all
deals that have not recovered cost is only 1.6% and 23% are forecast to make over 20% Net Deal
IRR. The chart below shows the track record of deals with a comparison of underwriting versus
actual Net Deal IRR.

As mentioned above and exhibited in the graphic below, we have demonstrated consistent

growth of collections and Adjusted EBITDA, with only a slowdown in 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic.

**_Integrated asset manager is a unique model not replicated by other market participants._**

Following the establishment of our Fund Manager and the raising of the Fund, we have

transitioned to an integrated asset manager model, which we believe is unique in our market and
enables our three businesses: the Fund and Investment Management, Asset Management and
Servicing and Balance Sheet to operate synergistically. Our Fund and Investment Management
business originates new investment opportunities, that our Balance Sheet business can co-invest
into and our Asset Management and Servicing business can then service.

We expect our Balance Sheet business to continue to co-invest alongside fund investments,

with a participation of 25% for the Fund and a lower participation, approximately 10%, for
subsequent funds. Our Asset Management and Servicing business currently services 71% of the
Fund’s investments and the Fund pays market referenced fees for such services. The integrated
asset manager model enables us to increase capital-light income, through management and
performance fees generated by our Fund and Investment Management business and asset
management and servicing fees delivered by our Asset Management and Servicing business.

We believe that there are two fundamental benefits to our integrated asset manager model.

Firstly, we can invest at scale and further build our considerable intellectual property of investing
in our chosen markets and secondly, the increase in capital-light earnings will in due course
fundamentally improve our financial profile.

Investing at scale allows us to further build intellectual property through building

origination capabilities through broadening and deepening relationships with Investment Portfolio
Sellers and extending our reach to source off-market deals. In turn, the increased level of portfolios
purchased enriches and builds our data and data analytical capabilities, leading to increased
accuracy of underwriting and pricing portfolios. The increased scale is an enabler to create
operational leverage within our platforms in our Asset Management and Servicing business,
allowing returns to be maximized. Strong returns build our capital-light earnings, enable


-----

deleveraging and increase the appetite from LP investors to commit financing to our subsequent
funds, enabling the growth of our Fund Manager with the ability to further grow and increase the
scale of our businesses.

Furthermore, our integrated asset manager model drives an improved financial risk profile,

given the increase in capital-light earnings generated. The increase in the level of capital-light
revenues generated for each investment drives a materially different return on capital employed.
The charts below show the indicative returns for a typical balance sheet investor with a Net Deal
IRR of 18%, before any overhead allocation versus the indicative returns for us under our
integrated asset manager model, showing the build of returns driven by the capital-light revenues,
as well as the indicative returns, pre-overheads, for us of between 25% (based upon our current
25% co-investment participation) and 40% (based upon the expected approximately 10% coinvestment participation for subsequent funds).

_Source: Company information._

We expect to be able to increase income generated through management and performance

fees charged to LP investors while increasing scale benefits to the Asset Management and
Servicing business through more increased and stable servicing income. We believe that the
gradual build-up of management fees, primarily fees charged on drawn capital, will grow a stable
revenue source with future funds.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our EBITDA from our capital-light businesses was

33% of our total EBITDA. Given the losses sustained during 2020, our capital-light businesses’
percentage of Group EBITDA was negative 48.4%, but after adjusting for the non-cash write off
of ERC in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic of £133.6 million, our capital-light businesses’
percentage of Group EBITDA would have been 19.0%. Our capital-light businesses’ percentage
of Group EBITDA (pre-Acquisition costs) was 22.5% for the six months period ended June 30,
2021. The decrease since 2019 primarily reflects the investment in the fund management
infrastructure, which will, in due course generate higher income as FUM continue to grow.

We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the returns on capital, the build of capital-light

revenues and the reduced level of purchases by our Balance Sheet business (we expect to reduce
our co-investment participation in future funds, including ACO 2, to approximately 10% from the
current 25%) will enable us to de-lever, reduce Net Debt and, in time, materially change our
financial risk profile.


-----

**_Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms._**

Our Fund and Investment Management business has a differentiated approach from other

institutional fund managers in the market. Based on our knowledge of the market, the majority of
credit funds have a small team based in international capital centers and access the NPL and noncore asset market by mainly targeting large bank asset auctions of greater than €100 million. On
the other hand, as highlighted in the chart below, our model is predicated on leveraging our large
local presence in each of our markets, with local asset servicing businesses providing deep asset
expertise on a granular basis, to form strong relationships with potential asset sellers and develop
a detailed knowledge of a wide range of asset classes on a granular level. Our model has enabled
us to consistently make more of our investments in non-competitive, off-market bi-lateral trades
that are smaller in size and offer higher returns.

_Note: Prepared based on Company information and estimates._

Our compelling proposition is highlighted by the Fund’s support from a diversified range

of sophisticated LP investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth,
university endowments and family offices, with global commitments ranging from the UK,
Benelux, Nordics, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S.,
Canada, Australia and Asia. Further, through our fundraising, we have had interactions with over
100 LP investors creating a very strong pipeline of potential investors for future fundraises.

Furthermore, our Asset Management and Servicing business has market-leading platforms

and is well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our businesses undertake a broad range
of services, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization and
litigation and court process management, master servicing activities, such as legal title holding,
securitization vehicle management activities and other activities such as due diligence, onboarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection and servicing to many of the large
institutional global and European debt funds. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and
_Servicing business.” Our combination of market leading positions, niche dominant platforms and_


-----

competitive specialist servicing and investment platforms across five markets position us as a local
operator with expertise in real estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing. We achieved
a record of 26 contract wins in 2020, with a further 11 new contract wins during the first half of
2021, one of which being our acquisition of the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco
Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced
service to customers in financial difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they
will need in the future. Tesco Bank chose to partner with us because of our focus on customers,
proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The
partnership is expected to result in over 200 of Tesco Bank’s personnel transferring over to us on
November 1, 2021. We have observed an increasing need for our services from banks such as
Tesco Bank given the pressure on their operations as a result of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. See “Industry—The debt collection and debt servicing market—Specialization and
_standardization.” The increasing use of digital mediums, with portals for self-service by_
customers, increases in our customer satisfaction scores ― we have seen an increase by 0.3 in our
customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9) in 2020 ― and embedded forbearance and
vulnerable customer policies and processes have facilitated our growth and are a key factor in the
industry awards that our platforms received in 2020.

Our market-leading platforms deliver significant levels of third party contract wins which

are backed up by the recognition we have received through awards and customer satisfaction. Most
notably, in 2020 we were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’
Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin
Money. Additionally, in November 2020 we became four time finalists after being nominated at
the Credit Strategy Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business
was recognized not only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio
Management Company (Global Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer
(International Investor) and Best Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).

**_Highly cash flow generative with conservative risk management and strong balance sheet._**

We are a highly cash generative business, with strong Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, our
Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation was £156.6 million and £90.7 million respectively. The build
of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow is illustrated in the chart below.

_Source: Company information._


-----

Furthermore, we retain flexibility on the level of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow that we re
invest in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, are able to manage any peaks and troughs in
liquidity requirements. This is evidenced by the fact that during 2020 the portfolio investments
that we made amounted to £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million during 2019, as we
sought to conserve liquidity, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As we develop our capital-light businesses, we expect to reduce the level of re-investment

in new portfolio acquisitions and, as such, we expect that a portion of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow
generation will support Net Debt reduction and deleveraging. We are targeting £500 million
Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation, after investment in new portfolios acquisitions for the period
2021–2025, which target we are not guaranteed to meet within the planned time frame or at all.
See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

As exhibited in the chart below, our balance sheet has both geographical and asset class

diversification. As of June 30, 2021, our 84 month ERC in the jurisdictions in which we operate
were as follows: 36% in the UK, 26% in Portugal, 21% in Italy, 15% in the Netherlands and 2%
in Ireland and, as of the same date, 66% was unsecured and 34% secured. This diversification,
together with the limited deal size of any single portfolio investment, minimizes our risk profile.

_Source: Company information._

Furthermore, as a result of the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our

conservative non-cash write down of 13.2% to our ERC as of June 30, 2020, reflected the
significant uncertainty at that time arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and is reflective of our
cautious approach. Details of the ERC write-down are shown in the graphic below.


-----

_Source: Company information._

However, as illustrated in the charts below, we are performing well against our ERC. This

creates a significant value upside - on the basis of an 84-month ERC of £1.6 billion, a 5% overperformance in actual collections equates to an approximate upside of £50 million after

the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter of 2020, first quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021,
our Cash Collections compared to our ERC were 141%, 111%, 106% and 131%, respectively.

**_Current strategic plan enhanced by TDR Capital ownership._**

Our management team has a deep wealth of experience and talent. Their track-record of

proven success places us in a position to expand upon our robust market position. The full support
of our incumbent senior management and their strategic targets, increased capital-light earnings
and reduced capital intensity, all increase our prospects of growth whilst also reducing leverage
under the new ownership of TDR Capital. Our goal of reducing leverage will be bolstered by TDR


-----

Capital’s commitment to reduce leverage (with a target of leverage being approximately 3.0 - 3.5
times by 2023) without compromising our existing risk appetite.

TDR Capital is a leading specialist buyout firm with total FUM of approximately €10

billion as of December 31, 2020 and is based in the UK. It was founded in 2002 by Manjit Dale
and Stephen Robertson, who were previously partners at DB Capital Partners. For further details,
see “Principal Shareholders.” TDR Capital has an experienced team of investment professionals
and operating partners and a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business
services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet
management and driver mobility company. TDR Capital has a low-volume investment strategy
(one to two investments per year) based on principles developed by the investment team over the
past decade. TDR Capital seeks to spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on
operational excellence through a tested and integrated operating partner model.

TDR Capital will provide operational best practices and fund management expertise

accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European investing and understand the structures and
culture required to enable our integrated asset manager model to thrive. TDR Capital has a strong
track record in the financial services industry, including specialty finance, leasing and insurance.
For example, TDR Capital helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of
unsecured debt, as its owner from 2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of
the value drivers and regulation relevant to the industry. TDR Capital has continued to actively
monitor the credit management industry and has closely followed our journey in public markets to
date, and believes that our team has successfully created a high quality, internationally diverse,
vertically integrated asset manager and fully supports management’s clear ambition to further
develop our capital-light based strategy.

We believe that access to their deep and trusted LP relationships and capital under TDR

Capital ownership will provide the flexibility required to expedite the development of our Fund
and Investment Management business and be instrumental in accelerating our further transition to
our capital-light model and deleveraging.

**Our Vision and Strategy**

Our vision is to be an innovative and valued partner in credit and asset management with

the purpose of building better financial futures for our customers. Our people as well as our
structure, culture and values are aligned with the delivery of our strategic objectives.

We have six key strategic objectives to support the delivery of our vision and purpose:

**_Build a scalable and sustainable fund management platform with a diverse spread of global_**
**_investors._**

The development in 2019 and 2020 of our Fund Manager has been central to the success

in raising the Fund and critical to our transition to becoming an integrated asset manager with a
capital-light business model. We believe our proposition to LP investors is both unique and
compelling, given our track record over the last 15 years, our ability to target high-return niches
in off-market trades, our use of local knowledge and experience of our local in-country teams to
drive performance and the strong underwriting discipline. We intend to further develop our Fund


-----

and Investment Management business, through raising subsequent funds at a larger scale and
growing the number and diversity of LP investors, to put us in the best position to achieve our
target of growing FUM to approximately €10 billion (over £8.4 billion) by the end of 2025, from
our FUM of €4.8 billion (representing approximately £4.1 billion) as at June 30, 2021. We expect
to commence the fund raising for our second fund, ACO 2, when the capital deployed, after
recycling collections, within the Fund is approximately 70% of the total capital commitments
(provided that the deployment rate remains consistent with historical rates of deployment). See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

The increase in both our Fund and Investment Management and Asset Management and

Servicing businesses are central to our strategy of growing more stable capital-light earnings with
a target 50% EBITDA coming from such businesses by the end of 2025. In turn, we believe this
transition will be instrumental to achieving our goals of de-leveraging and reducing our Net Debt.
The chart below shows the targeted shift in our EBITDA from our move from an NPL purchaser
model to our capital-light integrated asset manager model. However, there can be no assurance
that we will achieve such target within the targeted time frames or at all. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum_
_includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve_
_risks and uncertainties.”_

_Source: Company information._

**_Prioritize investments in high-value, granular niche products in our core markets whilst_**
**_creating opportunities for platform servicing revenue._**

We intend to continue to deploy capital in a manner similar to the investments that have

given rise to our track record. Over the last 15 years, we have developed a leading data analytics
capability with over 1,000 deals underwritten, over 10 million customer accounts created over
10,000 of underlying properties across multiple geographies. This has helped us develop an
expertise in forecasting cash flows that has consistently driven superior pricing and low volatility


-----

and delivered our strong track record. Our local operating teams have relevant experience and
expertise in both the local markets and asset classes in which we operate.

We continue to seek off-market investment opportunities, utilizing our strong origination

capabilities, deep relationships and in-depth local knowledge. We believe targeting such
opportunities maximizes the risk / reward through smaller transactions in more sophisticated
granular asset classes and creates a competitive advantage. The continuation of this investment
strategy, we believe, will benefit our Balance Sheet business and will continue to present a
compelling investment case for potential LP investors, allowing further fund raising into
subsequent funds, as well as creating asset management and servicing opportunities for our
platforms.

**_Industry-leading asset management and servicing expertise which supports our investment_**
**_ambitions, clients and customers._**

We will continue to develop our asset management and servicing platforms, through our

technology and our people, to deliver high quality service to our clients, fair outcomes to our
customers and strong collections performance.

We undertake a broad range of services, including secured and unsecured collection

activity, real estate asset realization and litigation and court process management, master servicing
activities, such as legal title holding, securitization vehicle management activities and other
activities such as due diligence, on-boarding and new origination. We also provide debt collection
and servicing to many of the large institutional global and European debt funds. Our combination
of market-leading positions, niche dominant platforms and competitive specialist servicing and
investment platforms across five markets position us as a local operator with expertise in real
estate, mortgage, SME and consumer NPL servicing.

We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure to ensure that it meets our objectives of

flexibility, control, resilience and cost effectiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic presented, in real
time and on a scale and timescale that could not have been forecast, the opportunity to test our
resilience to maintain service levels for our customers and our clients. Our continued development
will support growth in our external and internal asset management and servicing activity and, with
increased scale with the opportunities presented by the Fund and Investment Management
business, our ability to drive operational leverage.

**_Create a simple, efficient and flexible organization by deploying agile practices, supported by_**
**_strong leadership and a commitment to develop our people to reach their full potential._**

Through our governance, organizational structure and technology, we seek to create an

efficient organization that can adapt to change and remain agile to ensure that we can capitalize on
market opportunities. Our leaders and personnel are the core of our organization and with flexible
working structures, training and development, we aim to ensure that our people maximize their
potential.

The establishment of the Fund Manager and our integrated fund manager model, which we

believe is unique in the market, demonstrates the ability of our business to adapt and deliver
change. The agility of the organization was fully demonstrated as the transition partly occurred


-----

during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated challenges that resulted from lockdowns and
other restrictions.

**_Allocate capital dynamically to drive returns while effectively managing risk._**

We operate across multi-asset classes and multiple geographies. As such, we seek to

allocate capital, through our investments in portfolios, depending on the prevailing market and
economic environment, in order to maximize the risk-adjusted returns within overall risk appetite
and concentration limits.

Our capital deployment for both our Balance Sheet business and the Fund has been strong

through 2021. However, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we have
remained cautious in our approach to pricing and underwriting investment opportunities.
Deployment has focused more on off-market real estate and special situation investments with
shorter weighted average life, rather than unsecured investments that tend to have a longer
weighted average life. This approach to capital deployment allows us to achieve target returns
whilst seeking to minimize the risk profile of our investments.

**_Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) focus driving better operational outcomes._**

We remain fully committed to meeting our stakeholders’ expectations of being a

responsible corporate citizen and addressing key sustainability issues. Our focus on ESG is firmly
embedded in our purpose and culture and we believe this focus will drive better operational
outcomes. We recognize the importance of ESG for our stakeholders. The holders of the Notes,
our shareholders and LP investors recognize the importance and value of investing in responsible
businesses delivering sustainable returns. Our regulators require assurance over our policies,
processes and practices and will act against firms that are non-compliant. Our customers expect to
receive fair outcomes, whilst portfolio sellers and third-party asset management clients often
require assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly and therefore, acting responsibly
is increasingly becoming a competitive advantage. Also, our people want to work for a good
corporate citizen.

The primary focus of the social leg of our ESG strategy is ensuring fair customer treatment,

which was particularly relevant throughout the COVID-19 pandemic where forbearance and
vulnerable customer policies were critical in our support of our customers. Furthermore, we
significantly curtailed litigation during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we believe that acting
responsibly delivers better long term returns for all our stakeholders. In particular, our customer
satisfaction levels rose during 2020, throughout such a difficult period for many of our customers.

We expect to vertically re-align our governance by empowering our local champion

platforms with local accountability under a fund manager framework. This framework will, we
believe, deliver greater accountability and improve performance. Furthermore, we aim to maintain
our commitment to diversity and inclusion among our people, in order to build a human-centric
workplace and provide a positive work environment, supporting a diversity of working styles and
appealing to a wider talent pool whilst retaining talented people who want autonomy and choice.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated our support for our people to help keep
them safe with 100% of our staff fully operational and working from home by the end of March


-----

2020. Lastly, the environmental leg of our ESG strategy involves our focus on the evolution and
development of our internal policies and due diligence standards, coupled with our ambition of
net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. See “—ESG.”

**Our History and Development**

Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited (“AGGHL”) was established on October 8,

2005, as the subsidiary of Arrow Global Financial Services (“AGFS”), a leading U.S. debt
purchaser that was founded in 1961 as a debt collection agency (“DCA”). AGFS entered the debt
purchase market in the 1990s and established and refined the model of placing accounts on a caseby-case basis with specialist agencies based on bespoke data handling and analytics. In 2004,
AGFS was acquired by SLM Corporation (commonly known as Sallie Mae), a Fortune 500
financial services company, and in 2005, Zachary Lewy founded Arrow Global in the UK. In 2006,
we formed a joint venture with RBS Equity Finance to purchase defaulted consumer debt
portfolios in the UK, and in 2009, the Group was acquired as part of a leveraged buyout by the
RBS Special Opportunities Fund.

We grew to become a leading debt purchaser in the UK, and in 2009, we expanded our

portfolio purchasing activities to Portugal, becoming one of the first foreign debt purchasers to
purchase debt portfolios in that country.

In October 2013, we successfully completed an IPO, securing a Premium Listing on the

main market for listed securities and admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, while
raising net proceeds of £42 million to further support our portfolio purchase plan, which was
contributed to us via a shareholder loan. The listing process also involved the establishment of a
new board of directors with diverse business experience, enabling us to enhance and strengthen
our business going forward.

In November 2013, we were part of a consortium selected by the UK government following

a competitive bidding process to purchase student loans owed by approximately a quarter of a
million borrowers. Erudio Student Loans Limited took control of the portfolio of loans from the
Student Loans Company Limited, and we made an initial investment of £11 million, with a
commitment to make a further investment of £22 million.

Following the expansion of our debt purchasing activities into Portugal, we started to

acquire asset management and servicing platforms. In November 2014, we acquired Capquest
Group Limited (“Capquest Group”), an established participant in the UK debt purchase and
outsourced collections market that owned and serviced portfolios in the financial services, retail,
telecommunications and motor finance sectors. Capquest Group had over 26 years of experience
in the debt collection industry, and operated in the UK with a primary focus on non-performing
and semi-performing unsecured consumer loans. Capquest Group developed extensive debt
purchasing capabilities and had grown to become one of the largest privately-owned purchasers of
non-performing consumer debt in the UK (based on 120-Month ERC), partnering with a diverse
client base and holding positions on numerous debt purchaser and DCA panels. The acquisition
enabled us to service certain portfolios that we acquired in the UK. See “—Our businesses—Asset
_Management and Servicing business.”_


-----

In April 2015, we acquired 33% of the shares of Silver Parallel S.A. (the parent company

of Whitestar Asset Solutions, SA (“Whitestar”), a leading Portuguese servicer of secured and
unsecured loans), from CarVal Investors for a total consideration of €49.8 million payable over
two years, but we received full voting control and a 100% economic interest in Whitestar at that
time. In April 2016, we acquired a further 42% of the shares of Whitestar, increasing our total
shareholding to 75%. In April 2017, we acquired the remaining 25% of the shares of Whitestar for
a purchase price of €10.6 million. As part of this transaction, we also entered into a strategic
partnership with CarVal Investors to jointly originate Portuguese investments and provided a
formal five-year servicing commitment for CarVal Investors’ Portuguese originated Portfolio
Assets to be serviced by Whitestar. Additionally, we acquired Gesphone, a Portuguese servicer of
non-performing loans and owner of €77.2 million face value worth of portfolios, for a
consideration of €8.1 million. The acquisition was in line with our strategic goal of developing
origination and servicing capabilities outside of the UK. See “—Our businesses—Asset
_Management and Servicing business.”_

With our previous acquisitions building up our asset management and servicing capabilities

within the UK and Portugal, we expanded geographically with an acquisition in the Netherlands.
In May 2016, we acquired InVesting B.V. (“Vesting Group”). This acquisition added
approximately 502,000 customer accounts with a face value of €663 million as of December 31,
2015 and contributed to the diversification of the income streams of our business and our
origination capabilities. Vesting Group is a traditional DCA and pension service provider with
long duration customer relationships. Vesting Group also provides customer information to
minimize credit and payment risks for businesses. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management
_and Servicing business.”_

In line with our geographical expansion strategy, in April 2017 we acquired the Zenith

Service S.p.A. (“Zenith”) in Italy. Zenith is a servicing business focused on the Italian structured
finance market and continues to contribute to the diversification of the income streams of our
business and our origination capabilities. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and
_Servicing business.”_

In November 2017, we acquired Mars Capital Finance Limited and Mars Capital Finance

Ireland (together, “Mars Capital”), a mortgage servicing business with operations in the UK and
Ireland. Mars Capital provides servicing for mortgages covering first and second lien residential,
buy-to-let and SME commercial mortgages, and provides full loan lifecycle servicing, from loan
origination support to late stage recoveries and real estate sales, with particular focus on managing
distressed mortgages. Mars Capital has securitization origination, issuing and servicing expertise,
is rated as a primary and special servicer in the UK by Fitch Ratings, and is regulated by the FCA.
Mars Capital Ireland is regulated in Ireland by the CBI as a credit servicing firm under Part V of
the CBA 1997 (as amended by the Irish CSA) and has acted as a credit servicer in respect of more
than €1 billion worth of Irish mortgage assets. See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and
_Servicing business.”_

On March 1, 2018, we acquired Parr Credit S.r.l (“Parr”), an Italian servicing business for

unsecured performing and non-performing loans and customer relationship management for banks
and telecommunications companies. Parr also owns 20% of the equity in Parr Sh.p.k, which acts
as Parr’s offshore servicing center in Tirana, Albania. In 2017, Parr generated revenues of €17.5


-----

million (in Italian GAAP) and had approximately 200 employees. We paid a total consideration
amount of €20 million for the acquisition of Parr, €15 million of which was paid upon completion.
See “—Our businesses—Asset Management and Servicing business.”

In March 2018, we acquired Europa Investimenti, a leading originator and manager of

Italian distressed debt investments. Europa Investimenti invests in Italian companies through the
Italian court-administered administration and bankruptcy process, acquiring both assets and NPLs
related to distressed companies. From its inception in 2008 to 2017, it had completed 63
transactions. As of June 30, 2017, Europa Investimenti had gross assets of €63.2 million, with
revenues of €23.6 million and €9.8 million profit before tax for the twelve months ended June 30,
2017.

On July 26, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of Norfin, a leading manager of real estate

investments in Portugal. This acquisition strengthened our asset management and investment
capabilities, is highly complementary to our existing Whitestar platform, and allows us to offer a
comprehensive set of servicing solutions to investors in Portugal.

On April 8, 2019, we acquired 100% ownership of Drydens Limited, operating as

Drydensfairfax Solicitors (“Drydensfairfax”), a provider of legal services. This acquisition
broadened our UK range of servicing capabilities and skills across consumer and commercial
litigation, probate and insolvency. The total undiscounted consideration for the acquisition was
£11.1 million, including deferred and contingent consideration. See “—Our businesses—Asset
_Management and Servicing business.”_

Following our expansion from a UK unsecured debt purchaser to a multi-asset class and

multi-geographical debt purchaser and servicer with small fund management operations, we had
the necessary capabilities to build fund management infrastructure. In December 2019, we
launched our first discretionary closed-end fund, a pan-European non-performing loan fund, with
€836.8 million in total commitments, including €628.5 million subscribed by third-party LP
investors. In November 2020, we announced final close of the fundraising for the Fund, with total
capital commitments of €1.7 billion, including our investment. We expect that the Fund will invest
in selective European credit opportunities sourced through our Fund and Investment Management
business, leveraging the Group’s entire pan-European expertise to offer investors attractive access
to specialist and high-return asset classes. We will earn management fees through the Fund
Manager. The capital commitment comprises multiple investment vehicles, including a fund and
a co-investment program. See “—Our businesses—Fund and Investment Management business.”

On March 31, 2021, we announced the Board’s agreement to the terms and conditions of a

recommended all cash offer of 307.5 pence for each ordinary share of AGG by Bidco, a newly
formed company owned by certain of the investment funds managed by TDR Capital. The price
per ordinary share represented a premium of approximately 33.4% to the closing price of 230.5
pence per ordinary share on February 5, 2021 (being the last Business Day before the
commencement of the offer period) and 46.6% to the volume-weighted average price of 209.7
pence per ordinary share for the one-month period ended February 5, 2021 (being the last Business
Day before the commencement of the offer period). Following shareholder approval on May 21,
2021, with 93.79% of our shareholders voting in favor of the transaction, receipt of the final
antitrust and regulatory clearances on September 29, 2021 and the High Court sanctioning the

Scheme at the sanction hearing held on October 7, 2021, the Acquisition closed on October 11,

**Our businesses**

We are a leading integrated fund manager with three business units, being Fund and

Investment Management, Asset Management and Servicing and Balance Sheet, each providing
synergistic benefits to one another. We refer to our Fund and Investment Management and Asset
Management and Servicing businesses as our capital-light businesses, given the limited level of
capital required to operate those businesses. We believe that this capital-light model is unique (our
competitors employ a more capital-intensive model) and yields a number of benefits, including the
following:

1. We typically co-invest capital alongside third-party capital managed by the Fund and

Investment Management business at a ratio of 25:75 (i.e., we co-invest 25% while the
Fund invests 75%), with approximately 71% of portfolios managed and serviced by an
Arrow platform within our Asset Management and Servicing business. The capitallight revenues generated from fund and performance management fees, as well as the
portfolio asset management and servicing fees, result in an indicative return on capital
invested of approximately 25%. For a similar investment, the indicative return for a
balance sheet investor with no servicing capability would be 18%. We aim to reduce
the ratio of our co-investment in future funds managed by the Fund Manager to a target
ratio of 10:90. This would further boost the indicative return on capital from 25% to
approximately 40%. See “—Our Key Strengths—Integrated asset manager is a unique
_model not replicated by other market participants;”_

2. The model is fundamental to our target of generating at least 50% of EBITDA from

our capital-light businesses in the medium term, enabling us to de-lever and reduce the
level of gross and Net Debt on our balance sheet and grow earnings without increasing
the level of our debt and/or our balance sheet; and

3. We are able to grow and develop asset management and servicing revenues, enrich the

levels of customer data and build origination capabilities utilizing third-party capital.
The development of this intellectual property further enhances our growth potential.

An overview of each business unit is detailed below:

**_Fund and Investment Management business_**

This business comprises the fund and investment manager, the Fund Manager, responsible

for managing the Fund, alongside our existing businesses Norfin, Europa Investimenti and Sagitta.

The development in 2019 and 2020 of the Fund Manager has been central to the success in

raising the Fund, with total capital commitments of €1.7 billion, including our investment. Despite
clear market and operational challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we received strong
support from some of the largest and most sophisticated global investors from diverse sectors and
geographies, including the UK, Benelux, the Nordics, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, the East Coast
of the U.S., the West Coast of the U.S., Canada, Australia and Asia. See “—Our Key Strengths—


-----

_Differentiated origination capability supported by local platforms.” With a final close of €1.7_
billion in November 2020, the Fund received commitments from a broad range of investors,
including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments
and family offices with an average commitment of approximately €80 million. We expect that the
Fund will invest in selective European credit opportunities, leveraging the Group’s entire panEuropean expertise to offer investors attractive access to specialist and high-return asset classes.
LP investors in the Fund pay the Fund Manager fees predominantly based on drawn capital with a
small amount paid on committed capital. In addition, LP investors incentivize the Fund Manager
through performance fees. We participate in this performance fee regime with a 30% to 40% share,
which represents an important and potentially material income stream to the Fund and Investment
Management business. In addition to the management and performance fees that we collect, we
charge investors “designated charges,” which enables attributable costs to be re-charged to the
Fund and future funds.

The development of the Fund Manager and the fundraising of the Fund have enabled the

full transition to our capital-light integrated asset manager model. The Fund represented the largest
first time fundraise in private debt globally in 2020, the third largest credit fundraise in special
situations globally in 2020 and the fourth largest private credit fundraise in Europe. Set out below
are the fundamental reasons that we believe resulted in the success of our fundraising from LP
investors:

_1._ _Our people_

Our Fund and Investment Management business has an experienced team of professionals

with a demonstrable track record of investing in these asset classes across the geographies in which
we operate. This team collectively represents over 50 years and in excess of 1,000 deals of credit
investment experience and portfolio management experience in transactions of the type that are
within the Fund’s investment program. The team is led by Zachary Lewy, our co-founder who has
over 15 years of industry experience and who is Principal and CEO of the Fund and Investment
Management business.

_2._ _Our track record_

We, and our investment team in particular, have a demonstrable track record of investing

across the NPL and non-core asset classes within the geographies in which we operate and have
achieved both strong and stable returns over a significant period of time. The chart below shows
the IRR returns we have generated from our portfolio investments since 2010 as compared with
the returns from the euro high yield bond market:

_Source: Company information._


-----

_3._ _Our local presence to deliver a differentiated investment strategy_

We believe that our servicing platforms are well-placed to maintain their leading position

in the industry, and our Fund and Investment Management business benefits from the unique
capabilities of these platforms to stand at the center of opportunity flows for the most attractive
segments of European credit investing in the non-core and NPL segments. This unique position
has been established as a result of the work, reputation and experience of our professional teams,
both with respect to the deployment of capital into such opportunities and also defining,
maximizing and operationalizing collections strategies tailored to portfolios. The reliance that
many pre-eminent credit investor groups place on platforms such as ours for purposes of portfoliolevel advice, collections and other services, and the relationship-based nature of the EU credit
markets, are indicative that our platforms are well-positioned to retain this advantageous position
within the market.

The European debt purchase and servicing market has a number of key attributes, such as

the importance of trusted relationships and the value of scale and dependence on data excellence,
each of which is required to be successful in the long term. We have a proven track record of strong
and trusted relationships with debt sellers, which is critical to our being invited to participate in
portfolio sale processes on an ongoing basis, including negotiated transactions where the terms are
agreed on a bilateral basis outside of an auction process.

We demonstrated our origination capabilities at the time of fundraising for the Fund as

78% of the transactions executed in 2018 were acquired through bilateral off-market investment
opportunities and over 75% were from repeat transaction sources. This reputation and compliance
track record are critical factors for debt sellers, who tend to only work with trusted partners who
meet both of these stringent requirements and have exhibited the ability to execute transactions in
a timely manner. We believe there has been a trend among some large debt sellers towards
consolidation around a few trusted leading debt purchasers with the attributes of scale and a
commitment to compliance. This has led to a general reduction in the size of debt sellers’ panels
as debt sellers favor stronger, longer-lasting relationships with fewer participants. In addition, we
have built strong working relationships with credit funds, which have become a key part of our
origination strategy.

In view of the important roles played by the various components of our platform in

attracting and retaining clients, pricing deals with precision, and developing tailored collections
strategies for a wide range of different types of portfolios, we believe that the dynamics of market
leadership in European debt markets have changed. In the past, experience in collections, together
with capital participation alongside investors, formed the basis of a good foundation for a central
role in European NPL and non-core asset markets. Those attributes alone, however, are no longer
sufficient for pre-eminence in sourcing and servicing in the most attractive aspects of NPL and
non-core asset markets. We believe that incumbency advantage and recognition, borne out of a
consistent market presence, is often increasingly important.

In addition, deep data analytical capacities and compliance and regulatory expertise are

increasingly critical to defining the most successful strategies for sourcing, pricing, collection and
exit in NPL and non-core asset markets. In particular, we believe that our deep, country-specific


-----

understanding of the regulatory environments in the markets of our platforms and our status within
those markets are critical features of our success. For example, in some of the geographies in which
we operate, in addition to the FCA and other regulatory bodies’ standards, debt purchasers must
also meet the compliance standards of individual debt sellers (as well as satisfy rating agency and
securitization market norms) to be considered in debt sale processes. In some of the geographies
in which we operate, debt purchasers are generally required to obtain a license before being able
to acquire debt. In order to enhance the stature and functionality of our platform, since 2014, we
have acquired leading servicing and investment platforms holding a range of relevant prerequisite
authorizations that enable the platform to successfully source, underwrite and service loan
portfolios.

_4._ _Experience in Capital Partnering_

Historically, we have been able to offer market participants not only servicing functions

but also act as a capital participant alongside investors who are our clients. For example, in larger
portfolio transactions initiated by debt sellers, we have routinely acted as a capital investor
alongside credit fund purchasers of portfolios and, in such cases, have regularly taken a minority
capital stake alongside such credit funds to align interests in transactions involving our platform
for servicing and collections on the underlying loans. Subsequently, as the portfolio is duly
collected, it is often the case that we become the natural buyer of the remaining portfolio “tail” or
“stub” piece when the credit fund in question seeks an exit or finds it uneconomic to continue
overseeing the remaining, relatively small portfolio. At various points in time, we have partnered
with leading third-party private equity investors who have invested €3.4 billion of capital alongside
us from 2014 through 2018.

_5._ _A Focus on Data Analyses_

The deep portfolio expertise that attracts debt investors to our platforms is rooted in the

knowledge and information management capacities of the platforms that support the collection,
organizing and retention of high-quality data on portfolios in connection with investment and
collections activity. In particular, data excellence through our platform’s use of high-quality data
and analytical models is critical to pricing portfolio purchasing in a precise manner, improving
collection performance and operating the collections and borrower interface functions in keeping
with applicable compliance standards.

Our other businesses within Fund and Investment Management are Europa Investimenti,

Sagitta and Norfin. Europa Investimenti, acquired in 2018, is a leading operator in distressed and
special situation investments in the Italian market. Europa Investimenti specializes in debt
opportunities relating to small and medium-sized enterprise and real estate assets. Europa
Investimenti is the 95.64% owner of Sagitta SGR, S.p.A., a fund manager regulated by the Bank
of Italy. Norfin, acquired in 2018, is a prominent real estate fund manager that has been operating
for 22 years in Portugal and manages approximately €1.6 billion in both regulated and nonregulated assets. Its activity intersects the entire spectrum of the Portuguese real estate market as
it manages direct real estate investments with different risk profiles (i.e., the management of
portfolios that include offices, residential units, logistics, retail and tourism operations facilities,
in addition to project development ranging from the acquisition phase up to the design,
construction and commercialization phase).


-----

In addition, the Balance Sheet business pays an intra-segmental charge to the Fund and

Investment Management business for portfolio management services relating to the assets held on
our back-book assets at a rate of 150bps on net asset value and for Arrow SMA, based on a rate of
175bps during 2020 and 150bps from January 1, 2021 on drawn capital during the investment
period. The total blended fee rate for Fund and Investment Management during 2020 was 0.9% of
funds under management.

The Fund and Investment Management business had a total FUM of €4.8 billion as of June

30, 2021 (€4.3 billion as of December 31, 2020), and we aim to raise a new “flagship” fund
approximately every two years. Our target is to grow our FUM to over €10.0 billion by the end of
2025 with a goal of achieving 40% EBITDA Margin. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes
_forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and_
_uncertainties.” To ensure that we are able to achieve the required scalability, several critical hires_
have joined the business in line with our plans to strengthening our team. Organizational design
and process improvements have been established with governance, leadership and clarity of
responsibility formalized along with progress in management oversight. Furthermore, during the
first half of 2021, we continued to deliver process and operational improvements in line with our
targets and this trend is expected to continue, further enhancing our Fund and Investment
Management business. Ongoing focus on enhancing risk management practices into the Fund and
embedding daily risk management and other operations also continued in 2021. For example, we
have recently formed the Clients and Capital Formation Group within the Fund and Investment
Management business and recruited Mr. Kamran Anwar to lead this team. Mr. Anwar brings a
wealth of experience in financial services, having spent 23 years at Citigroup in leadership roles
across the Middle East, Europe and Asia, covering M&A, transaction banking, private equity, real
estate and corporate strategy. Most recently, Mr. Anwar spent five years in the technology
industry, where he worked with SS&C Technologies leading their private equity services franchise
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Clients and Capital Formation Group will partner with
our clients to provide differentiated investment solutions and world-class insights from our core
areas of expertise in European non-performing and non-core debt. We will seek to broaden the LP
set by enabling global capital pools to access the opportunities presented by the European NPL
market through our Fund Manager. Furthermore, we expect that the acquisition of our business by
TDR Capital will further enhance our access to LP investors. TDR Capital will provide operational
best practices and fund management expertise accrued through almost 20 years of pan-European
investing experience and its understanding of the structures and culture required to enable the fund
management model to thrive. See “—Our Key Strengths—Current strategic plan enhanced by
_TDR Capital ownership.”_

**_Asset Management and Servicing business._**

An important element of our success in building and growing our Fund and Investment

Management business and our Balance Sheet business is having access to the leading Asset
Management and Servicing platforms. These platforms service and manage debt collection and
other activities related to portfolio investments and enable us to service multiple asset classes
across multiple geographies. The development of strategies that maximize collections
performance, whilst simultaneously enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining adherence
to regulations, is key to the platform’s performance.


-----

Our Asset Management and Servicing business performs a broad range of services,

including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realization, legal title holding,
due diligence activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, master servicing,
securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management activities, new origination activities,
litigation and court process management and third-party sub-servicer management. Our Asset
Management and Servicing platforms are well-equipped for growth and generated revenues of
£125.4 million during the year 2020. Furthermore, an analysis of the fees generated during the
year 2020 from the various aforementioned activities is shown in the chart below:

The following graphic summarizes the services provided by our platforms across different

asset classes and geographies:

_Source: Company information._

As of December 31, 2020, our AUM was approximately £65 billion, apportioned in the

jurisdictions in which we operate as follows: UK and Ireland (three platforms with approximately


-----

£15 billion AUM), the Netherlands (three platforms with approximately £5 billion AUM), Italy
(three platforms with approximately £35 billion AUM) and Portugal (two platforms with
approximately £10 billion AUM). Further details of our platforms that have grown organically, as
well as through acquisition, are as follows:

_United Kingdom and Ireland_

Mars Capital: Mars Capital Finance Limited and Mars Capital Finance Ireland,

respectively a UK credit servicing company and an Irish-registered company, specialize in
servicing solutions for residential buy-to-let and small- and medium-sized enterprise commercial
mortgages. Mars Capital operates in the UK and Ireland and each entity is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Mars Capital in 2017.

Capquest Group: Capquest Group is a leading credit servicing company operating in the

UK. Capquest Group specializes in consumer assets and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG,
which acquired Capquest Group in 2014.

Bergen: Bergen Capital Management Limited (“Bergen”) is a prominent UK commercial

real estate (“CRE”) loan servicer that is active as a sourcing channel for loan investment
opportunities. Bergen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Bergen in 2018.

Drydensfairfax: Drydensfairfax is one of the largest UK law firms focused on the recovery

of debt and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Drydensfairfax in 2019.
Drydensfairfax operates under the auspices of applicable professional independence requirements
in providing leading debt recovery services.

_Italy_

Parr: Parr is a market-leading credit servicing company operating in Italy. Parr specializes

in consumer and mortgage assets and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Parr
in 2018. In 2019, Parr changed its name to “Whitestar S.r.l.” and is currently trading as Whitestar
Asset Solutions.

Zenith: Zenith is a prominent credit servicing company operating in Italy. Zenith

specializes in master servicing and securitization services and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
AGG, which acquired Zenith in 2017.

_Portugal_

Whitestar: Whitestar is an established credit servicing company operating in Portugal.

Whitestar specializes in consumer, small- and medium-sized enterprise and real estate assets and
manages Hefesto STC, SA, a regulated securitization vehicle. Whitestar and Hefesto STC, SA are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of AGG. Whitestar was acquired by AGG in 2015 and Hefesto STC,
SA was acquired by AGG in 2017. In addition to Whitestar and Hefesto STC, SA, AGG acquired
local servicer Gesphone - Serviços De Tratamento E Aquisição De Dívidas, S.A (“Gesphone”) on
April 1, 2015, and Effico (Effico – Gestão de Clientes e Recuperação de Activos, S.A.) on April
29, 2013, both of which have since been consolidated into Whitestar. On July 15, 2013, AGG


-----

acquired the assets of GE Money Servicing Ltd and transferred the platform and its staff to
Whitestar.

_The Netherlands_

Vesting Group: Vesting Group is an established credit servicing company operating in the

Netherlands. Vesting Group specializes in consumer assets and credit bureau services and is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AGG, which acquired Vesting in 2016.

Through the abovementioned platforms, we have access to an expansive historical data set

across approximately 10 million accounts belonging to borrowers across the geographies in which
we operate. The revenue of our Asset Management and Servicing business was £64.2 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2021. Revenues for this business were £125.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020 against £128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
demonstrating the resilience of this capital-light income stream through a significant economic
downturn. Throughout 2020, we secured a record 26 new contract wins. In the six months ended
June 30, 2021, we secured 11 new contracts. On August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire
the collections and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This
partnership will allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial
difficulty by providing the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future, with Tesco
Bank choosing to partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform
and the cultural alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in our
taking on over 200 Tesco Bank personnel on November 1, 2021. We believe that we are well
placed to win further new third-party contracts as a servicing partner for financial institutions that
require additional collections capacity given the growing non-performing loan volumes resulting
from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are also significant opportunities for the Asset Management and Servicing business

created by the Fund. It is estimated that approximately 65% of the Fund’s purchases will be
serviced on our platforms and the Fund will pay the Asset Management and Servicing business
market referenced fees for such servicing. Furthermore, profitability for the business is expected
to steadily increase as we continue to develop our operational efficiency. We aspire to a target
Asset Management and Servicing EBITDA Margin of 25% by 2025 from EBITDA Margins of
12.4% and 17.9% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There can be no
assurance that we will achieve such targets within the targeted time frames or at all. See
“ForwardLooking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Balance Sheet business._**

The Balance Sheet business comprises the investment portfolios purchased utilizing our

own capital, including co-investments via Arrow SMA and those made directly by us,
predominantly comprising the back-book. Prior to the deployment of the Fund in 2020, we
invested our own capital, sometimes co-investing with partners, to generate returns. Since the
deployment of the Fund, we have typically co-invested 25% alongside the Fund’s 75% investment,
although the level of co-investment by the Balance Sheet business may reduce for future successor


-----

funds. Please see “Business—Our Key Strategies—Highly cash flow generative with conservative
_risk management and strong balance sheet.” for a high-level overview of our 84-Month ERC by_
asset type and geography as of June 30, 2021.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cash Collections were impacted, particularly in

the second quarter of 2020, predominantly due to court closures, real estate market closures,
various moratoriums on certain legal and enforcement activities and temporary interruptions to
customers’ earnings across all of our core markets. We took a conservative view about the wider
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, revalued the ERC balance sheet
asset at the half-year mark of 2020, resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio investments of
£133.6 million. Cash Collections have performed strongly against these revised estimates,
collecting 125% of reforecast ERC in the second half of 2020 and by 119% in the first half of
2021. We remain cautious (investing in portfolios with typically a shorter weighted average life,
more granular assets and secured portfolios) and we anticipate that there is a reasonable possibility
of a deterioration in the economic outlook in late 2021 and beyond, as government financial aid
provided throughout the pandemic begins to recede and the various moratoria are lifted. As such,
there has been no material write-down of the ERC in 2021 and as of June 30, 2021, the non-cash
write-up of the ERC was £17.7 million.

In addition, we proactively managed cash as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and took

decisive action to reduce capital deployment. We saw a slowdown in the market, predominantly
driven by financial institutions taking a prudent approach to valuations and banks focusing on
initial provisioning over asset sales in the first six months of 2020. Full-year portfolio purchases
in 2020 were £109.9 million, compared with £303.7 million in 2019.

Since January 2020, our Balance Sheet business has typically co-invested 25% of the total

portfolio investment alongside the Fund through a 100% owned Jersey partnership, Arrow SMA,
with the expectation of approximately £200 million balance sheet purchases being invested by the
Fund annually. We expect the co-investment percentage to reduce over time and for our balance
sheet investments by future funds to amount to approximately £100 million per annum in the
medium term. We hold investment committees in respect of all deals and have carve-outs to
support policy requirements, thereby maintaining strong control over liquidity risk. The co-invest
model requires lower balance sheet investment volumes than historic levels, likely leading to a
faster de-leveraging profile and absolute Net Debt reduction. In addition, we anticipate that the coinvest structure with the Fund will simplify our accounting profile. As assets purchased through
the fund co-invest structure increase, the proportion of income accounted for on a fair value basis
through Arrow SMA will increase, and the share of portfolios accounted for on an amortized cost
basis will decline. Furthermore, the ERC on our new co-investments alongside the Fund are
calculated using collections net of asset management, servicing and collection fees that are
incurred within fund special purpose vehicles. Historically, the ERC was calculated using gross
collections.

**_Capital and balance sheet management_**

We have strict capital allocation processes with investments requiring Investment

Committee approval. Investment levels are forecast as part of our budget process to ensure that
leverage and liquidity expectations are in line with targets and appetite levels. As of June 30, 2021,


-----

our Secured Net Debt position was £1,154 million (£1,181 million as of December 31, 2020) and
leverage was 4.7 times (5.1 times as of December 31, 2020). Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow was
£90.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 (£156.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2020). Our increased focus on reducing capital intensity and growing earnings from our
capital-light businesses are expected to yield significant levels of cash generation. Our target is to
generate £500 million in cash after portfolio investments, during financial years 2021 to 2025 and
we believe that this cash generation will enable deleveraging. We are targeting our leverage to
reach 4.0 times (before incurring costs of approximately £85 million in connection with the
Acquisition) by the end of 2021, and to be within our target range of approximately 3.0-3.5 times
by 2023. These targets are indicative only and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
achieve such targets within the planned time frame or at all. See “Forward-Looking Statements”
and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes
_forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in forecasts that involve risks and_
_uncertainties.”_

**Cost Structure Development and Cost Saving Opportunities**

**_Cost Structure Development_**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total operating cost base amounted to

approximately £225 million. 58% of this amount (i.e., £131 million) was attributable to our
collection activity and our fund management costs, 10% (i.e., £23 million) was apportioned to the
Group’s operating expenses and 32% (i.e., £71 million) was spent on the expenses associated with
the operation of our platforms. The graphic below details our annual cost base on a granular level.

_Source: Company information._

As we have expanded into new markets and built our servicing capability, we have invested

in centralized functions as part of the One Arrow program – an implementation plan that we set in
place in order to obtain the horizontal alignment of our business across its different locations and
jurisdictions. Since the Target’s IPO in 2013, the Target’s pre-exceptional cost income ratio has
moved from being less than 50% to greater than 65%. The graphic below charts our cost to income
ratio from 2017 onwards. The proforma represents the position after delivering £20 million of
target cost savings as detailed below in “—Cost Savings.”


-----

_Source: Company information._

**_Costs Savings_**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total operating cost base amounted to £225

million. Based on TDR Capital’s and management’s estimates (as well as the strategic review
which we expect to undertake during the course of 2022), we are targeting annualized cost savings
of £20 million, to be derived as detailed below.

1. The transition of the Target from a public company to a private company has brought

about a number of significant changes to the Target Group, including the removal of the
Target’s public company board of directors together with a reduction of professional
costs, the eradication of the former long term management incentive and share incentive
schemes and the reduction in spending on investor relation activities, among others. We
believe that we will see cost savings in the amount of approximately £6 million as a
result of the privatization of the Target.

2. Going forward, we believe that there are areas of centralization to retain, but that certain

other functions may be better and more efficiently delivered with local accountability. As
such, we plan to vertically align our local platforms and the corresponding local
investment strategies under a fund management framework, allowing us to maintain
central origination and underwriting functions, supported by local expertise. In turn, this
will lead to the empowerment of our local platforms and enhance the accountability of
the business leaders of our local platforms. Our focus is on creating a cost-ownership
culture which engenders accountability and delivers efficiencies without creating duallayer costs. Our transition to operating under the vertically aligned model is expected to
bring about cost savings of approximately £6 million.


-----

3. As a result of the increased accountability, we expect further annualized cost savings of

approximately £8 million, which are initially targeted to be delivered over the course of
2022. We expect the majority of these savings to be delivered through platform
efficiencies, operational leverage and increased accountability. Furthermore, TDR
Capital’s experience with financial services and business services, together with its fund
management expertise, will allow us to leverage TDR Capital’s operational best practices
and lead to greater accountability for the business leaders in our local operations. See “—
_Our Key Strengths—Current strategic plan enhanced by TDR Capital ownership.”_
Overall, we anticipate that the savings that could stem from the implementation of greater
efficiency in our operations is approximately £8 million by the end of 2022.

An independent third-party advisor estimates total cost savings of between £17 and 32

million, with £9 to £20 million overhead cost reductions and £8 to £13 million in direct cost
reductions. This compares with the management’s target savings of £20 million as outlined above.
The independent third-party advisor also estimates one-off costs ranging from £10 million to £20
million in order to realize such cost savings. However, there can be no assurance that any such
cost savings and efficiencies will be achieved in time or at all or that we will not incur additional
costs to realize such cost savings. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Transactions—This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements_
_that involve risks and uncertainties,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This_
_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Transactions—We have included in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited adjusted data,_
_and other financial information not prepared in accordance with IFRS.”_

**Our investment process and operations**

We acquire portfolios through the Balance Sheet business and on behalf of ourselves and

third parties through the Fund and Investment Management business in the UK, Italy, Portugal,
Ireland and the Netherlands. Portfolios are acquired through a number of sales processes detailed
below:

    - _Auctions. A panel of investors or debt purchasers are invited to submit bids for_

portfolios. An auction process can take many forms, including sealed bids or more
competitive online procedures, and can be facilitated by an adviser, a broker or the debt
seller’s management team;

    - _Bilateral sale. Debt sellers engage in discussions with one selected party and negotiate_

the sale. In these transactions, debt sellers target investors with particular competencies
or deal execution capabilities to take on a given portfolio;

    - _In-situ sale. The sale of portfolios is accompanied by a legally binding obligation that_

such portfolios, which are then serviced by particular third parties, remain with those
third parties for a certain period of time post-acquisition. In-situ sales can be either
bilateral or auction-based. As our platform has the capability of functioning as both
debt servicer and purchaser, in-situ sales have historically included purchasing smaller
run-off portfolios (sometimes referred to as “portfolio tails”) from banks or credit funds


-----

that have placed the servicing/collections activity for those loan portfolios on our Fund
and Investment Management platform; and/or

    - _Secondary sale. The sale of loan portfolios from one debt purchaser to another either_

after a limited period of trial collections activity to establish value or after dividing a
portfolio into smaller pieces or at the end of a credit fund life. Secondary sales generate
additional liquidity for such debt sellers by facilitating the release of capital earlier and
providing debt originators with a platform to sell increasingly larger portfolios to wellfunded players that can then sell on to smaller debt purchasers, parts of the portfolios
that are less in line with their investment strategy and better suited for specialist
collection activity.

We have a strong origination function that is able to source a significant portion of our

investments “off-market” that are outside the competitive auction process. During 2020, 74% of
portfolio investments made by the Balance Sheet business were purchased off-market. In addition
to the differing types of purchases, we purchase across a broad range of sectors and markets as
follows:

    - _Financial services. The financial services sector is the largest originator of defaulted_

debts by value and typically has the highest appetite to use debt sale as a recovery
mechanism, making it the largest segment in the debt purchasing market. See
“Industry—The European NPL market.” This market segment is highly diversified by
type, age and quality of debt and debt seller. Debt sales in this sector mostly comprise
balances outstanding on credit cards, personal loans (including private sector student
loans), overdrafts, affinity cards, residential and SME mortgage loans and shortfalls,
and long-term retail debt receivables that have been originated by banks and credit card
companies, as well as small business credit. In addition, banks sell specialty real estate
loans, bankruptcy claims, structured credit and other credit in real estate receivables;

    - _Special_ _Situations._ Particular, non-programmatic event-driven investment

opportunities have formed an important part of our business through events impacting
counterparties, sellers and other institutions within the credit market that generate, or
themselves constitute, attractive investment opportunities;

    - _Litigation Related, Bankruptcy & Distress. Assets acquired through court and_

bankruptcy proceedings (such as through the Italian Concordato procedure), utilizing
our extensive knowledge of bankruptcy processes, provide for attractive investment
opportunities;

    - _Real Estate. The real estate sector across the geographies in which we operate offers a_

wide array of attractive investment opportunities ranging from mortgages and direct
real estate investments to real estate-backed assets;

    - _Structured Credit. A variety of structured credit products that continue to be offered by_

debt sellers account for a diverse range of attractive investment opportunities and
assets;


-----

    - _Telecommunications_ _and_ _Utilities._ Led by mobile phone companies,

telecommunication firms have increasingly looked to debt sale to recover unpaid bills.
Debt sales in this sector mostly comprise balances outstanding on unpaid mobile phone
bills or mobile phone contracts set up to provide a discount on a mobile device that
were terminated prior to their agreed maturity. Typically, telecommunications loan
portfolios have lower balances than debt in other sectors and are sold at the primary
and secondary stages. Similar attributes apply to a broad range of utilities;

    - _Retail. Charge-offs resulting from short-term credit offered by catalogue, phone or_

online shopping companies as part of their sales growth strategy are generally sold at
an early stage, usually before being placed with a DCA and thus often resulting in
higher value debt portfolios; and

    - _Government. Assets acquired through the rescue/nationalization of banks in the UK_

(managed by UK Asset Resolution) and Ireland (managed by The National Asset
Management Agency) as a result of the global financial crises and ongoing stresses of
the 2007-2008 global financial crisis continue to be unwound through programmatic
auction processes.

We follow a disciplined, systematic investment evaluation process for investments, which

utilizes expertise from different areas of the business and extensive historic data. This approach
has enabled us to consistently deliver good returns as demonstrated by our performance track
record. There are multiple stages to the evaluation process, typically including most of the
components or stages below:

_Origination_

We have a dedicated origination team that, with the assistance of local on the ground

personnel across the various platforms, has access to a wide range of relationships and sources of
potential investment opportunities including:

    - _Direct Relationships. We have a wide network of direct contacts with loan portfolio_

owners across the geographies in which we operate, and we leverage their relationships
to identify investment opportunities. The relationship network includes:

 third-party private investment funds and their managers and investment teams that

are seeking to dispose of or otherwise exit the positions held by their investment
fund entities at entity lifecycle end;

 sellers from whom we have previously purchased loan portfolios;

 entities that are clients of our market-leading loan servicing business;

 banks and other financial institutions that seek to do business or trade with a party

that “speaks their language;” and

 investment banks seeking a sophisticated investor or trade counterparty.


-----

    - _Intermediaries. We have a wide network of contacts with intermediaries that are active_

in the loan portfolio transactional market across the geographies in which we operate.
This relationship network includes a range of intermediaries employed by prospective
debt sellers of loan portfolios to run a competitive portfolio sale process, as well as
long-established relationships with the “Big 4” accounting firms.

_Screening_

Our investment team typically conducts an initial “screening” evaluation of each

opportunity identified through the origination process outlined above in order to determine
whether or not such opportunity is in line with our investment strategy, risk appetite and target
returns. The investment team will also consider whether the opportunity could be serviced by us,
or whether a third-party service provider will be required.

_Initial Analysis_

If the investment team determines, through the screening process described above, that an

opportunity should be pursued, the investment team will conduct an initial analysis in order to
formulate the optimal plan for conducting a more detailed assessment of that opportunity. This
initial analysis will typically include the following steps:

    - the investment team will review the initial data received from the debt seller or

intermediary and will request any additional data necessary to accurately price and
evaluate the opportunity in a way that would be adequate to support a non-binding offer
as described below;

    - the investment team will determine the level of due diligence that is required at this

stage of the evaluation process; and/or

    - the investment team will conduct an initial review of the sale and purchase agreement

if available and any other additional transaction documentation available, such as
information memoranda.

_Preliminary Investment Recommendation_

If an opportunity passes through the screening and the initial analysis phases, the

investment team will prepare a preliminary investment recommendation, which will typically
incorporate the following:

    - the investment team will prepare forecast collection curves and will work with our

portfolio management team and our internal or external servicing platforms to develop
the optimal servicing strategy for the opportunity and to determine the servicing costs
to produce a net cash flow forecast and forecast return on investment. These collection
curves will utilize our proprietary experience, statistical models using historical data
sets and/or external data sources; and/or


-----

    - the investment team will engage with colleagues from other functions (including legal,

operations, finance, risk or compliance, as appropriate) to develop all aspects of the
preliminary investment recommendation.

The preliminary investment recommendation is reviewed by the Investment Committee,

and, if approved, the transaction will typically proceed to the non-binding offer stage.

_Non-Binding Offer_

The non-binding offer will typically include the following details, although the debt seller

will often prescribe what details are required to be included:

    - an indicative purchase price for the opportunity, determined on the basis of the initial

analysis described above, together with a summary of the key assumptions on which
the purchase price is based;

    - details of any further diligence that we require in order to submit a binding pricing

proposal;

    - confirmation of approvals already obtained to submit the non-binding offer and the

approval process for subsequently submitting a binding offer; and/or

    - an overview of the portfolio servicing strategy to be implemented once the opportunity

is acquired.

_Due Diligence_

We adhere to a disciplined and comprehensive diligence process that is driven by our

knowledge of the market, data access, experience and other relevant points of reference, including
third party valuations of real estate assets. We believe that efficient due diligence is conducted
both by reference to proven, traditional checks and information as well as insightful, bespoke and
transaction-specific inquiry. In particular, we determine a diligence approach appropriate in light
of the asset type, proposed transaction structure, location of the asset or any other relevant
investment consideration.

_Legal, Risk, Tax and Other Departmental Sign-Off_

We fully leverage our in-house expertise throughout the evaluation process. The tax,

finance, legal, compliance and risk teams monitor each transaction by attending meetings and
reviewing selected due diligence documentation throughout the process until approval, as a second
layer of risk management. All departments are required to highlight any areas of concern with
explicit sign-off by legal and risk required for each investment.

_Investment Approval_

Once the due diligence for a proposed transaction is complete, our investment team

prepares a final Investment Committee memorandum and typically we would expect to complete
the following steps:


-----

    - the investment team will seek to refine the forecast curves on the basis of the additional

data obtained through the deeper analysis and due diligence;

    - the investment team will develop “base,” “best” and “worst” case scenario analyses to

reflect the high and low boundaries of expected returns based on our prior experience
or the known risks relating to the opportunity;

    - we will conduct a final review of the risks associated with the opportunity, taking into

account any factors mitigating such risks, such as a price reduction or additional
contractual protections in the sale and purchase agreement, and thereafter prepare an
explanation of any risks that cannot be mitigated and a recommended course of action
in respect thereof; and/or

    - the investment team will prepare a contract summary of the key commercial aspects of

the sale and purchase agreement.

The investment will then be discussed and, if appropriate, approved at an Investment

Committee meeting. There are differing levels of committees required depending upon the
quantum of the investment. If the opportunity is approved, we proceed to submit a binding offer
for the opportunity and, if successful, will seek to execute the transaction to acquire the subject
opportunity.

_Operational Implementation_

The operational implementation team within each platform is overseen by our portfolio

management team and is responsible for ensuring that the investment is “loaded onto” the relevant
internal or external platform successfully. This will generally include:

    - a bespoke implementation plan for each investment;

    - a review of the transaction documents to ensure a thorough understanding of the

contractual obligations;

    - a project plan to ensure the implementation runs smoothly;

    - loading loan information onto all relevant systems;

    - post-implementation oversight, including put-back monitoring (i.e. returning or

“putting back” accounts that do not meet the agreed criteria or where the debt seller
fails to provide adequate documentation or data on the account), for a specified period
of time; and

    - lessons learned review for consistent improvement.

_Portfolio Management_

Our portfolio management team, which is part of the Fund and Investment Management

business, is responsible for the post-acquisition management of all portfolio investments, including


-----

the Fund, future funds and our back-book. Our portfolio management team is split between: (i)
fund-level strategic portfolio management, focusing on fund-level structuring, implementation of
portfolio strategies, overseeing fund-level business planning and reporting and leading postpurchase projects; and (ii) in-country portfolio specialists, who utilize market knowledge and
expertise to monitor portfolio performance strategies and provide active oversight of in-country
servicing platforms. This functional design achieves a balance of fund-level strategic oversight
and reporting with local in-country knowledge and expertise.

Our portfolio management team has adopted a well-defined and transparent operating and

governance regime which drives consistency and clear expectations for all portfolios under
management. This also includes appropriate delegated authority and decision frameworks to
deliver necessary governance. The primary operating and governance regime comprises:

    - Fund Performance Management Meeting (“P3M”), which is a strategic fund-level

forum covering portfolio performance trends across all investments within a specific
fund, together with ongoing portfolio management projects such as financings, asset
sales and securitizations. The P3M meets monthly, is led by the portfolio management
team and includes senior management representatives from across origination,
underwriting, portfolio management, finance and capital allocation.

    - In-Country Portfolio Performance Committees (“PPC”), which are hosted in each

geography and distinct for each fund. The PPC represents the first line control over the
relevant servicing platform’s effectiveness in managing that fund’s investments. It
meets monthly and includes senior representatives from our Fund and Investment
Management and Asset Management and Servicing businesses. The PPC discusses and
reviews portfolio performance, seeks to understand what is driving potential under- or
over-performance, and sets strategies and actions to improve performance where
relevant.

Our approach to portfolio management and our team’s engagement with both internal and

external servicing platforms continues to adhere to our guiding principle of treating customers
fairly and managing debt repayment circumstances based on our customers’ individual
requirements. This was particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic when we offered
support and guidance at a time when our customers needed us most.

_Portfolio Servicing_

Our platforms, including Europa Investimenti, as well as external servicers are responsible

for undertaking various activities, including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate
asset realization, legal title holding, due diligence activities, initial platform migration and onboarding activities, master servicing, securitization vehicle set-up and ongoing management
activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party subservicer management.

Our approach to collections is dependent upon the type of portfolio acquired. For example,

Capquest Group services unsecured consumer debt in the UK where collections are typically small,
regular, annuity-like payments collected over a long period of time, with a highly sophisticated


-----

data analytical and statistical approach to collections being employed. Using data analytics to
determine the most efficient, effective and regulation-compliant collection strategy, which may
involve litigation strategies, we generally pursue two broad types of collection activities:

    - _Payment plans. Most customers pay by entering into long-term repayment plans, which_

provides us with significant cash flow visibility.

    - _One-off payment. These arise when a customer makes a payment (less than the full_

amount) that leads to the closure of the account and any remaining balance is written
off. We make a settlement assumption on each portfolio when it is purchased, which
has an impact on the purchase price.

Platforms servicing such portfolios employ agents that will contact customers by telephone

or increasingly by digital means to seek payments with amounts varying depending on customers’
individual circumstances and the portion of such customers’ disposable income available to service
defaulted debt. During 2020, we enhanced our digital capability including a new interactive SMS
service which allowed customers to contact us when it suited them most.

Conversely, the Italian operation of Europa Investimenti is very different as collection

activity typically involves legal and court processes and the realization of esoteric assets. Our
highly experienced and skilled team at Europa Investimenti may use external brokers, agents and
valuers to provide a bespoke solution to maximizing collections value.

An important component of our cash collection strategies is ensuring we operate in

accordance with our values and that we achieve fair outcomes for customers while complying with
our regulatory responsibilities. Our Group Customer Forum (“GCF”) brings together the best
practices developed in the geographies in which we operate, with the aim of improving customer
outcomes. The GCF is essential in sharing best practice within each country’s operations and
driving forward positive change. It is also tasked with ensuring that we deliver consistent customer
treatment - as evidenced by our COVID-19 response - and using data and learned customer
behaviors to guide future strategies and service enhancements. The GCF is currently in the process
of devising standardized customer experience metrics, including how we can utilize vulnerable
customer and complaint management information to improve our processes and policies. We
believe that our local and Group customer forums are driving real value, and during 2020 we
achieved the following:

    - increased customer satisfaction scores, averaging 7.7 (out of 9);

    - the development of a customer framework to govern our commitment to customers and

our adherence to our guiding principles for collection activities;

    - unified vulnerable customer strategies which enabled a swift response to the COVID
19 pandemic, including an immediate hold on litigation activities, the implementation
of informal repayment plans of up to three months, as well as other payment
arrangements including a switch to interest-only or a reduction and cessation of interest,
depending on customer circumstances;


-----

    - standardized customer key performance indicators, including customer satisfaction,

abandonment and breakage rates, complaints and digital uptake;

    - expanded customer payment and communication channels, including SMS, virtual

IBAN, customer portals, live chat and online appointment bookings;

    - the enhancement of our website to allow for a more customer-friendly browsing

experience; and

    - the undertaking of a deep dive into our vulnerable customer strategy which revealed

high levels of satisfaction with focused improvements in respect of customers’ digital
experience and customer reviews.

We are proud recipients of various customer service awards. Most notably, in 2020 we

were awarded the Credit Strategy ‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding
and Customer Engagement, in recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Additionally, in
November 2020 we became four-time finalists after being nominated at the Credit Strategy
Collections and Customer Service Awards. In Portugal, in 2020, our business was recognized not
only as a Top Employer but accredited as the Best Credit Portfolio Management Company (Global
Banking and Finance Review), Best Asset Management Servicer (International Investor) and Best
Practice Operator of the Year (ACQ5, Country Awards 2020).

**Technology Infrastructure**

We recognize the importance that our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure plays

in ensuring that our people can maximize business performance and deliver great outcomes for our
customers. Our IT infrastructure is therefore built to provide flexibility, control, resilience and cost
effectiveness. We operate a Microsoft first, cloud-based/virtualized approach and have invested in
the consolidation of our infrastructure in order to integrate it across our platforms, where
appropriate.

Our platforms use a number of core systems; Prod and Latitude in the UK and Ireland,

Galaxy in Portugal, DaVinci and Credit Navigator in the Netherlands and a SaaS solution known
as Sydema in Italy. Development is transitioning to a centralized approach in order to ensure that
there is a common and consistent approach across all of our internally developed/managed
systems, with a DevOps and SCRUM approach to development and a drive to automate testing.
Where we develop systems, we seek to retain ownership of the intellectual property related thereto.
For example, in Portugal, we are in the process of developing our own core platform, Galaxy,
which is based on core Microsoft technologies and is due to go live in November 2021. We own
the intellectual property rights to the Galaxy system. Similarly, we retain the intellectual property
for our development of a fund management system that will provide core functionality for our
Fund and Investment Management business.

In addition, we have developed customer portals allowing customers to self-serve, with

customers able to make payments via a portal across many of our platforms. Furthermore, we are
also developing a more automated solution for our third-party clients enabling a seamless use of
our technology through ‘white label’ solutions.


-----

Data is key to our value proposition and is therefore safeguarded for the benefit of our

colleagues, customers and clients. A fundamental area of operational risk management and
operational resilience is our approach to information security. We benchmark our minimum
information security standards against the international standard of good practice for information
security, ISO 27001. Our framework involves identifying our critical data and applying the
relevant protection controls to safeguard such data. We acknowledge, however, that the cyber-risk
landscape is continually evolving, and in response to this, we are investing in our people, processes
and technology in order to protect our colleagues, customers and clients, as well as to strengthen
our ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. Given that cyber-attacks are
inevitable, we continue to focus on deploying resources, training our personnel and building up
our technological resilience. We utilize a number of systems, such as Netscope, Mimecast and
Okta to respond to potential cyber threats made via the web and our internal email and
authentication systems.

Although cyber risk forms a critical component of our operational resilience and scenario

testing, we acknowledge that it is not the only business disruptor that can have a significant impact
on our operations. As such, the development and strengthening of our business operating model
encompasses the development of our culture, processes and systems such that our business is best
placed to perform in line with our strategy in the face of disruption, regardless of the source of
such disruption. This holistic approach to the development of the systems involved in our business
will enable us to anticipate, protect and plan for operation recovery. Our approach to business
continuity for our IT infrastructure is to ensure that our systems are “always on,” enabled by our
use of cloud-based data centers. As such, in the event of a system breakdown, we expect to be able
to recover all systems within approximately two hours with only minimal transaction history data
loss.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented a real-time test of our operational resilience, and our

ability to respond positively to the COVID-19 pandemic has been critical to our stakeholders. Our
cloud-based approach allows access to our systems via the internet from any location at any time
and as a result, all of our personnel were able to work from home on a fully operational basis by
the end of March 2021. Despite transitioning our customer service operations to remote working,
our customers, who already have access to our customer self-service portals for payments across
many of our platforms, were supported seamlessly with no outage in customer service delivery.
The high quality of service we continued to deliver during 2020 is evidenced by the fact that we
received various awards for our customer-service operations, most notably the Credit Strategy
‘Best Outsourcing and Partnership’ Initiative for Onboarding and Customer Engagement, in
recognition of our work with Virgin Money. Building upon the resilience of our operations and IT
infrastructure, the roll out of Arrow Everywhere is still underway and is expected to allow greater
technological flexibility for our employees who work remotely.

In addition to protecting our data and systems from external threats, we also actively

manage our data in line with our internal data governance and management strategy. To ensure
compliance with this strategy and the applicable regulations, including GDPR and UK GDPR, we
utilize tools, such as Exonar and Primed, to trawl systems to manage data and create a framework
for compliance in line with contractual and regulatory requirements.


-----

We recently completed the first phase of our strategic finance and reporting transformation

program, which involves the implementation of a common Microsoft Enterprise platform to
standardize finance processes and controls across the Group. This will provide greater levels of
insight, increased control and reduced reporting timelines through increased efficiency, and will
also support the delivery of our strategy by strengthening the control environment and by
producing higher quality information and analytics thereby enabling a better understanding of the
commercial drivers of the business and enhanced strategic decision-making.

All change is overseen by our central change management team to ensure a consistent and

common approach as we seek to develop aligned infrastructure across all platforms. Local change
management teams are utilized with their knowledge of regulations, practices and language
particular to each of our platforms.

For risks relating to our IT arrangements, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our

_Operations —Our growth may strain our resources, affect our ability to maintain our levels of_
_collections or affect our ability to implement effective portfolio pricing standards, which could_
_materially adversely affect our business.” and “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our_
_Operations—We outsource most of our core IT applications, systems and infrastructure to third-_
_party service providers and may have difficulty identifying and retaining suitable alternative_
_service providers.”_

**Litigation**

We engage in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business to collect on the

debt that we own or manage. Outside of these ordinary course of business proceedings, we do not
believe that any proceedings are material or will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position.

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 2,500 full time employees, approximately 7%

of whom were employed in central functions. 28% of our full time employees worked in our UK
platforms, approximately 25% of them worked in our Italian platforms and approximately 24%
worked in our Portuguese platforms. We have a rigorous and selective recruitment, training and
retention strategy in order to maintain our high standards of service. All newly recruited employees
are provided with a comprehensive induction program which includes comprehensive training on
our legal and regulatory compliance policies. Employee performance is tracked through on-going
performance management reviews and a performance grading system. In addition, employees
involved in collection activities have additional monitoring, training and customer ratings to ensure
fair outcomes for customers. In addition, we have invested in a new online tool called Peakon to
measure engagement and cultural characteristics across the Group, and during 2020, the Groupwide engagement score was rated ‘good’ (i.e., 7.5/10).

**Properties**

We lease our offices in Manchester, Glasgow, London, Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Hilversum,

Amsterdam, Almere, Heerenveen, Ghent, Milan, Rome and Dublin.


-----

**ESG**

We remain fully committed to meeting our stakeholders’ expectations of being a

responsible corporate citizen and addressing key sustainability issues, viewed through the lens of
our ESG framework. See “Business—Our Vision and Strategy—Environmental, Social and
_Governance (“ESG”) focus driving better operational outcomes.” We recognize long-term_
sustainable success is linked to the fortunes of the stakeholders that we serve. As society’s
expectation of businesses continues to grow, we aim to stay ahead of those expectations. We
believe that by integrating sustainability and ESG considerations throughout our operations, we
can enhance our business performance, support the financial health of our customers and better
support the diverse communities within which we operate.

Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resilience of our purpose and

values and we are confident that we have responded in a timely and thoughtful manner, with much
success in relation to many of our stakeholders such as colleagues, clients and our markets as a
whole. Our social commitments were demonstrated as customers received additional support as
required, with specific COVID-19 customer outcomes provided to help those most in need
throughout the pandemic. Our exemplary approach to the treatment of customers also feeds into
our meeting the expectations of portfolio sellers and our third party asset management clients, as
such clients seek assurance that their customers will be handled responsibly. Communication with
our regulators is always beneficial but was key during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
regulators require consistent assurance that our policies, processes and practices reach regulatory
muster and we consistently aim to maintain open communication with regulators and compliance
with regulations. Our colleagues benefitted from swift deployment of working from home
protocols supported by our IT, business continuity and crisis management teams. As well as
prioritizing the safety and well-being of our stakeholders during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has informed our operational resilience and
colleague engagement plans going forward. It also translates into benefits for both existing and
new clients based upon the quality of delivery that we showed even in an unprecedented operating
environment. Our governance focus remained strong throughout 2020, with additional levels of
decision-making control being used during the pandemic in addition to our existing country-level,
executive and board committees.

We believe that we do not have any material environmental compliance costs or

environmental liabilities. See “Management” for details on our governance arrangements.

**Current Trends**

**_Collections performance_**

The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to our collections performance, particularly in

the second quarter of 2020 due to court closures and temporary interruptions to customers’
earnings. At that time, we were cautious about the wider economic conditions and revalued the
ERC balance sheet asset at the half year 2020, resulting in a non-cash impairment of portfolio
investments of £133.6 million. Cash Collections have performed strongly against these revised
estimates, outperforming the estimates by approximately 25% in the second half of 2020. For the


-----

first half of 2021, our collections performance was £179.6 million, representing 119% of the
December 2020 forecast ERC.

The impact of COVID-19 on the wider macro-economic environment remains uncertain,

in particular once government support schemes, such as the furlough scheme in the UK, are
withdrawn. While we remain cautious, the resilience of collections performance was evident
during July and August 2021.

We believe the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, operating results, cash

flows and/or financial condition will primarily be driven by the severity and duration of the
pandemic’s long-term impact on the markets in which we are active and the global economy and
the timing, scope and effectiveness of government responses to the pandemic, which are all beyond
our knowledge and control. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term adverse
impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial
condition, but the adverse impact could be material. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to
_our Operations—Our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations have been_
_and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.”_

**_NPL and non-core asset market dynamics_**

We believe that, given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of NPLs and

non-core assets is expected to increase. At present, the level of primary auction sales has been
relatively low as banks have focused on initial provisioning over asset sales. Whilst we do expect
the primary markets to become more active during the latter part of 2021 and into 2022, we have
seen strong appetite for our servicing capabilities from financial institutions which require
additional collections capacity given the growth in NPLs. Throughout 2020, we secured a record
26 new contract wins. Further, on August 17, 2021, we announced plans to acquire the collections
and recoveries operations within Tesco Bank’s Customer Service division. This partnership will
allow Tesco Bank to deliver an enhanced service to customers in financial difficulty by providing
the necessary support and flexibility they will need in the future, with Tesco Bank choosing to
partner with us, given our customer focus, proven expertise, technology platform and the cultural
alignment between us and Tesco Bank. The partnership is expected to result in our taking on over
200 Tesco Bank personnel on November 1, 2021. Overall, we believe that we have a strong
pipeline of opportunities for further new third-party contracts.

In addition, the importance of our origination capability, through our trusted relationships,

access to secondary markets and our local platforms, resulted in approximately 74% of our deals
being originated off-market during 2020 (based on our calculations) and has ensured that
origination volumes have been strong during the first half of 2021. Our Balance Sheet business
invested £94.8 million for the first half of 2021. Furthermore, 54% of the Fund was deployed or
committed (gross, before capital recycling) as at June 30, 2021, compared with 45% as at March
31, 2021. We expect to reach 70% deployment (after cash recycling) by early 2022 (provided that
deployment rates remain consistent with historical deployment rates), enabling the start of
fundraising for our second fund in respect of which we are targeting a €2.5 billion fundraise.
However, there can be no assurance that such targets will be achieved in time or at all. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—This


-----

_Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, certain targets and assumptions in_
_forecasts that involve risks and uncertainties.”_

**_Pricing for portfolio investments_**

As noted above, the capital deployment for both us and the Fund has been strong through

2021 to the date of this Offering Memorandum. However, given the uncertainty of the
macroeconomic environment, we have remained cautious in our approach to pricing and
underwriting investment opportunities. Deployment has focused more on off-market real estate
and special situation investments with shorter weighted average life, rather than unsecured
investments that tend to have a longer weighted average life. This approach to capital deployment
allows us to achieve target returns whilst seeking to minimize the risk profile of our investments.
The average Net Deal IRR of investments purchased during the six months ended June 30, 2021
was 16%, reflecting our cautious underwriting. The 2020 vintage (i.e., deals purchased in the year
ended December 31, 2020) has continued to perform strongly with the Net Deal IRR for the 2020
vintage rising from 18% as of December 31, 2020 to 21% as of June 30, 2021. Actual cash
collections on the 2020 and 2021 vintages for the period to June 30, 2021 have represented 230%
and 296% of the collections for that period at underwrite.


-----

**REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE**

**Regulatory Framework**

The key aspects of the regulatory framework currently applicable to our business are

described below.

**_Fair Debt Collection Practices_**

Some aspects of our business, including anti-money laundering, consumer credit and

mortgage servicing, are regulated on the basis of pan-EU laws retained in the UK following its
departure from the EU. However, these do not cover all aspects of debt collection regulation, so it
is not possible to comply with a single rulebook in the UK and the EU. Each country in the EU
has developed its own set of rules for debt collection operations. The various regulations cover,
among others: the methods by which claims can be assigned or transferred; the ways in which a
customer can be contacted and a debt collected; and the types and level of fees, interests and costs
that can be imposed, and whether those fees, interests and costs can be passed to the customer or
the client.

In countries where there are no specific regulations covering debt collection and where no

licensing requirements apply for certain debt collection operations, there are still regulations of a
more general nature which we must observe when carrying out our debt collection operations.
Such regulations include, for example, general civil and commercial rules and consumer protection
laws and regulations regarding caps on collection fees and interest costs. Any regulatory changes
reducing the amount of such costs we can recover may have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

In all countries in which our operations are licensed or regulated, our subsidiaries are

subject to certain integrity tests with respect to debt collection. These integrity tests may include
verifying that the collection business is carried out in accordance with local rules and regulations;
the directors of the board have sufficient knowledge and experience and have not misused any debt
collection permissions; and the directors meet other general suitability and reliability checks.

**_Statutes of Limitations_**

Rules regarding the length of time after which an unpaid debt may not be pursued by

creditors and the ways in which the statute of limitations can be tolled so that a debt can remain
collectible also vary across jurisdictions. In a majority of the countries in which we operate, it is
possible to extend the statutes of limitation on historic debt claims indefinitely by using various
methods, including enforcement actions, notification of the customer or otherwise interrupting the
limitation period with continued court proceedings. Some of the countries in which we operate
have in the past changed the statutes of limitation for certain debt including by limiting the ability
to extend or interrupt the limitation period, or have discussed doing so. We constantly monitor any
changes in these rules in the countries in which we operate, and, where appropriate, implement
local procedures to interrupt the limitations period. Any significant reduction in the statute of
limitations or in the ability to toll the statute of limitations, and any failure to implement local
procedures to interrupt the limitations periods, would negatively impact our operations.


-----

**_Anti-money Laundering_**

Our operations are subject to anti-money laundering laws.

On May 20, 2015, Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial

system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/843 (“4th
**and 5th AML Directives”) was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council. The 4th**
and 5th AML Directives enhanced previous client due diligence requirements and also provided
for greater enforcement powers, including stricter sanctions with maximum administrative fines
of at least €5,000,000 or 10% of total annual turnover. Following the UK’s departure from the EU,
UK legislation implementing the 4th and 5th AML Directives has been retained in UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA.

**_United Kingdom_**

The consumer credit and mortgage industry in the UK is highly regulated. Operating in

compliance with applicable regulatory requirements requires considerable investment in
processes, know-how and management.

The FCA is primarily responsible for the regulation of conduct in retail, as well as

wholesale, financial markets and the infrastructure that supports those markets. The FCA’s
“operational objectives” are to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system by
securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers, protecting and enhancing the integrity
of financial markets and promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA
also has a “strategic objective” of ensuring that relevant markets it regulates function well. In the
UK, the principal sources for the regulation of consumer credit activities and mortgage conduct
are:

  - the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000;

  - the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI

2001/544);

  - (for consumer credit activities) retained provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and

some related secondary legislation;

  - (for mortgage conduct) the Mortgage Credit Directive Order 2015; and

  - the rules and guidance in the FCA Handbook (including CONC, which is the FCA

specialist sourcebook that applies to firms carrying on credit-related regulated activities,
and MCOB, which is the conduct of business sourcebook for mortgages and home finance).

Until April 1, 2014, consumer credit in the UK was regulated under the CCA, with the OFT

responsible for protecting consumer interests and regulating consumer credit firms. The regulation
of consumer credit activities in the UK under the CCA implements, but goes well beyond the
requirements of the CCD. Responsibility for regulating consumer credit activities was transferred


-----

to the FCA in April 2014 as an additional function to be undertaken within the framework of
FSMA and certain retained parts of the CCA.

The MCD sets out the EU’s framework of conduct rules for mortgage firms and was

implemented in the UK through the MCDO. The domestic legislation implementing both the MCD
and the CCD have been retained in UK law following its departure from the EU by virtue of the
EUWA.

In keeping with its operational objectives, the FCA carries out thematic reviews, conducts

consultations and revises its policy and rules as part of its ongoing process of regulating the
consumer credit and mortgage industry. Identification of poor practices or poor outcomes for
consumers can result in policy and rule changes that bring about significant changes. For example,
the FCA:

    - introduced a price cap on high-cost short-term credit (including “pay-day loans”)

which came into force on January 2, 2015. In a Feedback Statement issued in July 2017,
the FCA confirmed its decision to maintain this price cap. The Feedback Statement
also identified key areas of concern with the high-cost credit sector including arranged
and unarranged overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit.
Further to that Feedback Statement, on January 31, 2018, the FCA issued a High-Cost
Credit Review Update in which it confirmed its ongoing concerns with these areas. The
FCA also announced a price cap on “rent to own” products in March 2019;

    - published the final report of its market study of competition in the credit card market

on July 26, 2016, which found that, while competition was working fairly well, credit
card firms could do more to help higher risk consumers and those with persistently high
credit card debt, such as by identifying early signs of debt problems and intervening
accordingly. In April and December 2017, the FCA consulted further in this area and
has introduced further changes to address its concerns. On February 27, 2018, the FCA
published its final policy statement on new rules for the credit card market. The changes
provided more protection for credit card customers in persistent debt or at risk of
financial difficulties. The new rules came into force on March 1, 2018, and firms have
had until September 1, 2018, to comply with them;

    - published the findings of its thematic review of early arrears management in unsecured

lending on December 13, 2016, which found (among others) that, for customers
showing signs of financial difficulty, the majority of firms missed early opportunities
to identify this and offer appropriate forbearance;

    - published final guidance on April 24, 2017, on the fair treatment of mortgage customers

in payment shortfall which requires firms to cease the practice of automatic
capitalization and provide redress to affected customers;

    - published the findings of its thematic review on staff incentives and remuneration in

consumer credit firms on July 4, 2017, which found that a significant proportion of
firms had high risk financial incentives likely to encourage high-pressure sales or
collections and had inadequate or ineffective controls;


-----

    - published a consultation paper on July 31, 2017, on assessing creditworthiness,

including affordability, in consumer credit the purpose of which is to amend the FCA’s
rules and guidance in order to clarify its expectations of firms (such as factors to be
taken into account when assessing whether credit is likely to be affordable);

    - announced its intention in July 2018 to consult on mandating removal of the minimum

repayment anchor as part of its efforts to limit the use of credit cards for longer-term
borrowing;

    - published its policy statement in July 2018 with final rules on assessing

creditworthiness in consumer credit; and

    - published the Woolard Review report to the FCA Board on February 2, 2021 on change

and innovation in the unsecured credit market, which set out a number of
recommendations to the FCA for improving regulation of the unsecured lending
market.

Additional exceptional measures have been taken by the FCA in response to the COVID
19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the FCA announced, through guidance (and subsequently,
through the updating of that guidance in June, November and December 2020), measures for
supporting mortgage borrowers experiencing payment difficulties. According to the FCA’s
guidance:

“… where a customer is experiencing or reasonably expects to experience payment
difficulties as a result of circumstances relating to coronavirus, and wishes to receive a full
payment deferral, a firm should grant a customer a full payment deferral for three monthly
payments, unless it can demonstrate it is obviously not in a customer’s best interests.”

The FCA issued similar payment deferral guidance for consumers experiencing difficulties

due to the COVID-19 pandemic in repaying credit products (including personal loans, credit cards,
store cards, catalogue credit, motor finance, rent-to-own, buy now pay later and pawn broking
agreements). The FCA’s guidance contemplates that such deferral schemes would end on July 31,
2021.

The Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis

Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (the “Debt Respite Scheme”) came into
force on May 4, 2021. Broadly, the Debt Respite Scheme provides for two types of relief: (i)
protections available to anyone with debt protecting them from creditor action for up to 60 days
by pausing most enforcement action, preventing contact from creditors, and freezing most interest
and charges; and (ii) protections available to debtors receiving mental health crisis treatment.

In July 2021, the FCA published its business plan for 2021/22. Among the priorities for

the period are an increased focus on authorization, to ensure that from the point of authorization
firms have high standards and maintain them. The FCA also intends to proceed with its work on
the introduction of a new consumer duty, requiring firms to put consumers at the center of their
business plans. There are also a number of initiatives scheduled for 2021 including: a consultation
on bringing interest-free buy-now pay-later credit agreements within the FCA’s authority; a review


-----

of the high-cost short-term credit price cap; and a consultation paper on how to provide ongoing
support to borrowers in financial difficulty.

At the European level, the European Commission published a legislative proposal to amend

the CCD in June 2021, and published a report on its review on the MCD in May 2021 that may
also lead to further legislative changes.

As is the case across many financial services industries, the industry in which we operate

is currently undergoing, and may in the future undergo, a number of significant regulatory changes.
These affect us, Investment Portfolio Sellers and our DCAs. We believe that the regulatory
environment favors participants with scale, such as us, that are more likely to be able to adapt and
comply with evolving consumer protection policy and the increasing volume of regulation in the
industry. Investment Portfolio Sellers are also becoming increasingly cautious in their selection of
debt purchasers and DCA partners, and those who can demonstrate robust compliance processes
are favored.

_The UK Consumer Credit Regulatory Framework_

Since April 1, 2014, the FCA’s responsibilities have been extended to the consumer credit

market and regulated consumer credit activities such as lending, credit brokerage and other
ancillary credit-related activities. As noted above, the consumer credit regime principally consists
of FSMA, the CCA and the FCA Handbook (in particular, CONC). Many of the requirements
applicable to regulated credit agreements are prescriptive in nature and include obligations to:

    - provide customers with prescribed pre-contractual information;

    - ensure that credit agreement documentation complies with prescribed, detailed content

and form requirements;

    - provide customers with copies of credit agreement documentation at the outset and

during the term of the agreement upon request;

    - provide customers with prescribed forms of notices in relation to defaults and

termination;

    - provide customers with prescribed forms of post-contractual statements and notices;

    - ensure an “unfair relationship” does not arise between the lender and the borrower; and

    - ensure that their agreements do not contain unfair terms (and, if they do, the legislation

provides that any unfair terms are not binding on the customer).

In addition to regulatory action, non-compliance with these requirements could, for

example, result in the underlying loan agreement being unenforceable against the borrower and
the borrower having no liability to pay interest or default charges (for the period of noncompliance).


-----

_The UK Mortgage Regulatory Framework_

The mortgage regime principally consists of FSMA, the MCDO and the FCA Handbook

(in particular, MCOB). The regulation of residential mortgage business entered into force on
October 31, 2004. There have been incremental changes to the mortgage regime over time—for
example, there is no longer a requirement for the security to be first ranking in order for a mortgage
to fall within the mortgage regime and some mortgages which were previously subject to the
consumer credit regime are now subject to the mortgage regime (although some protections
afforded by the consumer credit regime may still be available).

Some of these changes were introduced as a result of the MCD, which was transposed into

UK law through the MCDO on March 21, 2016, which remains in force pursuant to the EUWA.
The MCD is focused on residential mortgages with the intention of preventing the irresponsible
lending and borrowing practices that became apparent during the financial crisis. It is also aimed
at creating a more efficient and competitive single market for mortgages. The implementation of
the MCD has also resulted in greater regulation for certain consumer buy-to-let mortgages than
was previously the case (for example, the Mortgage Credit Directive Order introduced conduct of
business regulations and information requirements for customers of consumer buy-to-let
mortgages).

Many of the requirements of the MCD were pre-emptively introduced in the UK through

the FCA’s Mortgage Market Review in April 2014. However, the MCD is broader in scope than
the previous UK mortgage regulation and applies a standard approach to first charge mortgage
contracts and second and subsequent charge mortgage contracts, whereas previously the FCA
distinguished between the two. The implementation of the MCD has resulted in the first and
subsequent charge mortgage markets being much more closely aligned, primarily by now treating
second and subsequent charge contracts as regulated mortgage contracts. We currently use third
parties to service accounts affected by the MCD, relying (pursuant to Article 62(a) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001) on their regulatory permissions
for mortgage administration.

_FCA Authorization_

Pursuant to Section 19 of FSMA, a firm must be authorized to carry on regulated activities

by way of business in the UK. A contravention of this requirement is a criminal offense (and may
result in any underlying customer agreements being unenforceable without a validation order).
Similar sanctions may also apply for breaches of the financial promotions regime. Additionally,
the direct and indirect involvement or an unauthorized person in a regulated activity may result in
the underlying customer agreement being unenforceable (and may, for example, also allow that
customer to recover monies/property and/or seek compensation).

Examples of regulated activities include:

    - entering into a regulated credit agreement as lender;


-----

    - exercising, or having the right to exercise, the lender’s rights and duties under a

regulated credit agreement (therefore, debt purchasers who acquire the lender’s rights
and duties under the credit agreement are required to be authorized);

    - debt administration;

    - debt collection;

    - entering into a regulated mortgage contract;

    - administering a regulated mortgage contract; and

    - agreeing to carry on a regulated activity.

Arrow Global Limited has been registered with the LSB as an associate subscriber since

July 2016. Arrow Global Limited, Arrow Global Massey Limited, Arrow Global Legh Limited,
Capquest Debt Recovery Limited and Drydens Limited are currently the only Group businesses
with full FCA authorization to conduct certain consumer credit-related regulated activities in the
UK. Mars Capital Finance Limited and Drydens Limited have full FCA authorization to conduct
certain mortgage-related regulated activities in the UK.

Prior to granting full authorization for a firm to carry on regulated activities, the FCA is

required to carry out a thorough assessment of the applicant, including their business model, and
to determine whether that firm will meet the required organizational and suitability standards
(referred to as the “threshold conditions”).

The “threshold conditions” are the minimum organizational and suitability requirements

which must be satisfied in order to obtain (and maintain) FCA authorization. These relate to
matters including the location of the firm’s offices, whether the firm is capable of being effectively
supervised by the FCA, the quality and quantity of the firm’s resources (including both financial
and management resources), whether the firm is a “fit and proper person” to conduct the relevant
activities and whether the firm has a suitable business model.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of our entities has had any application

to obtain any authorization, permission, permit or license refused or denied or has had any
authorization, permission, permit or license cancelled (other than on its own initiative).

_FCA Handbook_

The FCA’s approach to regulation and the standards it requires firms to maintain are set

out primarily in the FCA Handbook (mainly in the form of rules and guidance).

Some of the requirements that apply to the UK Regulated Firms are set out in the following

sections of the FCA Handbook: PRIN, GEN, SYSC, SUP, MCOB, CONC and COCON.

PRIN are a general statement of the fundamental obligations that firms must comply with

under the regulatory system and are regarded by the FCA as the basis for most of the other more
detailed rules and guidance and include, for example, principles that a firm must conduct its


-----

business with integrity; pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly; and
deal with its regulators in an open and cooperative way and disclose to the FCA appropriately
anything relating to the firm of which the FCA would reasonably expect notice.

The rules in:

    - GEN relate to matters such as status disclosure and interpretation of the FCA

Handbook;

    - SYSC require firms to organize and control their affairs responsibly and effectively,

including requiring firms to establish and maintain appropriate and risk-sensitive
financial crime policies and procedures, and to identify, assess and mitigate the risk of
money laundering in their business. They also include, among others, general
organizational requirements relating to governance, requirements relating to the skills,
knowledge and expertise of staff, Senior Managers and Certification Regime
(“SMCR”), outsourcing responsibilities, record-keeping requirements and rules
relating to conflicts of interests;

    - SUP relate to ongoing supervisory matters, setting out the relationship between the

FCA and the firms it regulates, including requirements for firms to make various
notifications to the FCA and detailing supervisory powers;

    - MCOB require firms carrying on home finance related activity (such as regulated

mortgage lenders and servicers) to comply with requirements on matters such as preand post-contractual requirements, responsible lending, charges, arrears and
repossessions;

    - CONC require firms carrying on consumer credit related activity to comply with

requirements on matters such as pre- and post-contractual requirements, responsible
lending, debt collection and debt advice; and

    - COCON sets out the FCA’s rules concerning the conduct of certain persons working

in firms.

A contravention by a firm of any requirements set out in the FCA Handbook could result

in regulatory action (for example, the imposition of a financial sanction) and/or (in certain cases)
a claim for damages brought by a private person (for example, a borrower under a loan agreement).

_Senior Managers and Certification Regime_

In response to the 2008 banking crisis, the UK Parliamentary Commission for Banking

Standards (“PCBS”) recommended a new accountability framework focused on senior
management, with authorized firms taking more responsibility for assessing whether their own
employees are fit and proper.

The FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) began applying SMCR to the

banking sector from March 2016; Parliament made further changes to legislation in May 2016,
and required the regime to be extended to all FSMA-authorized firms from December 9, 2019.


-----

The key elements of the SMCR are:

  - _Senior Managers: the most senior individuals who perform specified roles or functions_

within the firm (“Senior Management Functions”) are the ‘Senior Managers;’ senior
managers require approval by the FCA; each senior manager has a “statement of
responsibilities” detailing the areas they are responsible for; certain “prescribed
responsibilities” specified by the regulator must be allocated to one or more of the senior
managers; and senior managers are subject to a statutory “duty of responsibility” requiring
them to take reasonable steps to prevent, or stop, a breach of rules in their area;

  - _Certification Staff: employees who are not Senior Managers but whose job can cause_

significant harm to the firm, its customers or the integrity of the market, fall within the
certification regime; amongst other requirements, these employees must be certified as fit
and proper by the firm;

  - _Code of Conduct: the conduct rules set basic standards of personal conduct; they apply to_

almost all employees within firms; some conduct rules apply to everyone within scope,
some apply only to senior managers; firms are required to give training on the conduct
rules and notify the FCA if they have taken disciplinary action against an employee for
breach of them; and

  - _Ongoing assessment: firms must assess whether Senior Managers and certified staff are_

“fit and proper,” on an ongoing basis and at least annually; as part of the initial fit and
proper assessment, firms are expected to request regulatory references to cover the last six
years of employment.

_Controllers Regime_

Any potential acquirer seeking to acquire 20% or more of the shares or voting power in

one of the UK Regulated Firms or one of their parent undertakings (or, shares or voting power in
either as a result of which that acquirer would be able to exercise significant influence over the
management of one of the UK Regulated Firms), will have to obtain the FCA’s prior approval and
notify the FCA if it should dispose of shares or voting power such that its holding falls below 20%.
A failure to obtain FCA approval will amount to a criminal offense.

_Unfair Terms_

In the UK, the UTCCR applies to agreements entered into with a consumer on or after July

1, 1995, but prior to October 1, 2015 (and were not individually negotiated). The CRA (which
came into force on October 1, 2015) consolidated much of the existing consumer rights law in the
UK. Among others, it repealed the UTCCR in relation to new consumer contracts made on or after
October 1, 2015, and effectively merged the consumer protection rules under the UTCCR and the
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The CRA applies to agreements entered into with a consumer on
or after October 1, 2015, or agreements which were, since October 1, 2015, subject to a material
variation such that they are treated as new agreements falling within the scope of the CRA. The
CRA also applies to notices of variation (such as variation of interest rates) made since October 1,
2015.


-----

Under the UTCCR and CRA, it is possible that any agreement that has been made or

entered into with a consumer may contain terms that are deemed by a court (or other body) to be
“unfair,” which may result in the possible unenforceability of such terms (and may ultimately
affect the ability to collect payment under any loan). However, a term of an agreement may not
generally be assessed for fairness if it specifies the main subject matter of the contract or relates to
the appropriateness of the price payable under the contract by comparison with the goods or
services supplied under it (provided that the term is written in plain and intelligible language and
brought to the consumer’s attention in such a way that the average consumer would be aware of
the term).

In light of the broad and general wording of the UTCCR and CRA, it can be difficult to

predict whether a court (or other competent body) would find a term to be unfair. It is therefore
possible that any agreement covered by the UTCCR, the CRA or any other unfair terms legislation
may contain terms that are deemed to be unfair, which may result in the possible unenforceability
of such terms of such agreement.

Since the UTCCR and CRA are based on an EU directive, similar issues may arise in EU

Member States.

_Unfair Relationships_

The CCA provides for an “unfair relationship” test which applies to a broad range of credit

agreements. In the event that a court determines a relationship between a creditor and debtor to be
unfair, it has broad powers to grant a wide range of remedies (for example, the court could require
certain sums to be repaid to the debtor). There is no statutory definition of what would amount to
an “unfair relationship” as the test is intended to provide flexibility.

By way of example, the UK courts have determined a relationship to be unfair where (i)

broker commissions (the existence and/or amount) were not disclosed to debtors prior to their entry
into a loan agreement and (ii) payment protection insurance commissions were not disclosed to
debtors prior to their entry into a loan agreement.

_Supervision and Enforcement_

The FCA has wide powers to supervise, and intervene in, the affairs of a regulated firm. It

can, for instance, require firms to provide particular information or documents to it, formally
investigate a firm or undertake sector-wide projects to address risks across, for example, a range
of firms or particular market segment.

The FCA’s supervisory approach is built around three types of work. The first type is

proactive, which entails pre-emptive identification of harm through review and assessment of firms
and portfolios. The second type is reactive, which addresses issues that are emerging or have
already happened at a firm. The third type is thematic, which entails wider diagnostic or remedy
work where there is actual or potential harm across a number of firms.

The FCA undertakes monitoring of regulated firms and may ask to perform an on-site visit

to ensure that the business of such firms is compliant with all of the applicable requirements.


-----

Where consumer detriment (for example) is found, the FCA will use its powers of intervention,
which might include taking enforcement action and/or securing redress for consumers.

Firms are categorized by the FCA, which is the conduct regulator for around 51,000

financial services firms, for supervisory purposes on a risk basis to determine the level of
supervision applied, varying from having dedicated supervisory teams through to ad-hoc
supervision.

The FCA may use its investigatory powers to look at past behavior but will then apply the

sanctions that were in force at the time of the breach. The FCA’s investigatory powers allow the
FCA to require persons to answer questions and provide documents or information and to apply
for warrants to enter and search premises. The FCA also has the power to bring civil, criminal and
disciplinary proceedings. These powers enable the FCA to, for example:

    - withdraw authorizations and approvals;

    - stop individuals from working in financial services;

    - stop an individual from carrying out specific regulated activities;

    - suspend a firm from carrying out specific regulated activities;

    - suspend an individual from carrying out specific regulated activities;

    - publicly censure firms and senior managers;

    - impose substantial financial penalties;

    - seek injunctions;

    - apply to court to freeze a firm’s or individual’s assets;

    - seek restitution orders; and

    - prosecute firms and individuals who undertake regulated activities without

authorization.

_Complaints Reporting and Publishing Requirements_

Regulated firms must record every complaint they receive, including how they resolved it,

and keep the record for three years. Firms will also be required to provide the FCA with a report
of the complaints they have received every six months (although some exceptions apply to smaller
firms). There is also a general obligation on firms to publish a summary of their complaints data,
with specific rules on the timing of publications. The information about complaints that firms must
provide and how often firms should report and publish complaints will depend on the activities
they carry out.


-----

_Complaints and Compensation Arrangements_

In the UK, the FOS acts as an independent adjudicator of the complaints made to it (by

individuals and small enterprises). A decision by the FOS is binding on the business, but not on
the complainant. There are formal escalation procedures for a complainant to make a complaint to
the FOS. However, the FOS, rather than necessarily making a decision solely on the basis of strict
compliance with the law, makes its decision on the basis of what is fair and reasonable in the
circumstances, taking account of the law, rules and good market practice. The FOS can address
complaints in relation to a regulated firm’s regulated and unregulated activities.

The Financial Services Compensation Scheme is the UK’s statutory compensation scheme

for customers of financial services firms. It can pay compensation to customers if a firm is unable,
or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it. Since April 2018, the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme has covered debt management firms.

_Data Protection_

The GDPR entered into force on May 25, 2018. The UK is no longer a member of the EU,

but has retained the GDPR in its domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the body of law retained
in the UK, including the Data Protection Act 2018, is referred to as the “UK DPA”). The GDPR
applies to (i) organizations that process the personal data of data subjects (natural persons) located
in the EEA in the context of the activities of an establishment in the EEA and (ii) organizations
outside the EEA that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EEA, or that monitor the
behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The UK DPA applies to (i) organizations that process the
personal data of data subjects located in the UK in the context of the activities of an establishment
in the UK and (ii) organizations outside the UK that offer goods or services to data subjects in the
UK, or that monitor the behavior of data subjects in the UK. For the purposes of the GDPR and
the UK DPA, personal data is information that can be used to identify a natural person, including
a name, a photo, an email address, or a computer IP address.

The GDPR and the UK DPA (and other similar data protection laws in other countries)

provide greater protection for data subjects by requiring, amongst other things, personal data to be
processed lawfully in a fair and transparent manner, to be collected for specified, explicit and
legitimate purposes, and to be limited to what is adequate or necessary in relation to those purposes.
Data controllers must be able to respond to the rights of data subjects, which includes the right of
individuals to access their personal data, to seek to rectify inaccurate data, to have personal data
erased where processing is no longer required, to seek to restrict the processing of their personal
data, and to object to the processing of their personal data. Controllers and processors of personal
data must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the rights of
data subjects and ensure a level of security against loss, misuse or unauthorized access. A personal
data breach which results in the likelihood of a risk to the rights of a data subject must be notified
to an appropriate supervisory authority without undue delay; a breach with a high risk to the rights
of a data subject must be notified to the data subject (also without undue delay). Where third parties
are involved in the processing of personal data, or where personal data is being transferred to other
countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection, appropriate arrangements must be
put in place, such as, e.g., the use of standard contractual clauses.


-----

Certain violations of these data protection laws may result in significant administrative

fines, e.g., under the GDPR, organizations can be fined up to €20 million, or in the case of an
undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year,
whichever is higher. Any failure to comply with privacy and data protection related obligations
may therefore result in significant liability, which could have an adverse effect on the reputation
of that party and its business.

In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office or ICO is an independent governmental

authority responsible for maintaining, upholding and promoting the best business practices and
legislative requirements for processing personal data and safeguarding the rights of individuals
with respect to their personal data. The ICO is empowered to impose requirements through
enforcement notices (in effect, stop orders), issue monetary fines and prosecute criminal offenses
under the UK DPA.

We control the processing of significant amounts of personal data. We have undertaken a

data protection impact assessment, updated our contracts with processors, published a privacy
notice, implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to maintain the security of
personal data and established a data protection policy, an information security policy and a data
retention policy and we follow the applicable guidance issued from time to time by the ICO, in
particular, e.g., in relation to the handling of data subject access requests from individuals.

The OFT, the ICO, the CSA and the DBSG have in the past indicated their support for data

sharing practices that enhance compliance and improve the customer’s debt collection experience,
and the FCA has also indicated such support. Following a consultation, the ICO published the Data
Sharing Code of Practice in December 2020, which was laid before Parliament in May 2021; it
became a statutory code of practice on data sharing in July 2021.

_LSB’s Standards of Lending Practice_

The LSB is a self-regulatory organization that promotes fair lending and positive consumer

outcomes in the UK principally through the Standards of Lending Practice. The Standards of
Lending Practice (previously the Lending Code) developed by the LSB came into operation on
October 1, 2016, and are applicable to UK banks and lenders who are registered with the LSB.
According to the LSB’s website, the personal standards came into force on October 1, 2016 and
were most recently updated on April 8, 2021 (with effect from July 1, 2021). The business
standards came into force on July 1, 2017 and were most recently updated on August 5, 2020 to
provide advice on products offered under the Government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption
Loans Scheme and Bounce Back Loan Scheme.

We have been registered with the LSB as an associate subscriber since July 2016. The

majority of UK Investment Portfolio Sellers are registered with the LSB and, therefore, look to
ensure that their third-party service providers and debt purchasers also comply with the
requirements of the LSB and specific credit business activities.

As a consequence of being registered with the LSB, we are expected to comply with the

relevant provisions of the Standards of Lending Practice. Our policies are reviewed and updated
against the requirements of the Standards of Lending Practice.


-----

The LSB actively carries out thematic reviews and/or publishes reports in respect of

activities that are relevant to us, primarily in relation to the Standards of Lending Practice for
personal customers. The LSB conducts reviews of each standard or code, as well as risk-based
thematic reviews. The LSB generally seeks to understand how firms meet their commitments in
its less formal capacity, and as new concerns relating to consumer outcomes emerge, adapt the
Standards of Lending Practice accordingly to help firms develop an appropriate approach for
dealing with them.

Given the regulatory focus on ensuring fair treatment for both personal and business

customers and, by their nature, the evolving Standards of Lending Practice, industry participants
may be subject to additional compliance burdens which may have an impact on our profitability.
In addition, the findings of the LSB’s reviews may trigger investigatory work or enforcement
action by the FCA.

_The Capquest Group_

The Capquest Group, which is a UK consumer debt purchaser and outsourced collections

provider, contains one operating company (Capquest Debt Recovery Limited) which is subject to
the regulatory framework as set out above. Additionally, one operating company (Capquest
Mortgage Servicing Limited) holds regulatory permissions allowing it to service regulated
mortgages. Consequently, this entity currently is subject to certain rules within the FCA regime
for regulated mortgage activities in addition to the regime in respect of regulated consumer credit
activities described above.

_Debt Claims Protocol_

The Pre-action Protocol for Debt Claims (the “Debt Protocol”) is a pre-action protocol

setting out the steps the court would normally expect parties to take before commencing
proceedings. Pre-action protocols are approved by the Master of the Rolls and are annexed to the
Civil Procedure Rules. The Debt Protocol has as its core principle that debtors should be provided
with sufficient information to enable them to obtain advice on their position prior to the issue of a
claim from the creditor. The Debt Protocol requires the provision of various documentation before
litigation proceedings are commenced, including, for example, a full statement of account, a copy
of the original credit agreement and details of any assignment together with details of the notice
of assignment; imposes time periods before proceedings can be commenced; and calls for resort
to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms before starting court proceedings. Failure to comply
with the Debt Protocol in respect of a claim could adversely affect our ability to pursue litigation
in respect of such claim. In addition, the FCA may not regard litigation as an appropriate remedy
in certain circumstances. In January 2021, the FCA wrote a ‘Dear Board of Directors’ letter to
portfolio firms identifying certain poor practices involving litigation, including seeking judgement
from vulnerable customers. The FCA stated that it expects firms to pay due regard to the interests
of their customers and treat them fairly.

**_Portugal_**

Hefesto is a regulated securitization vehicle (sociedade de titularização de créditos) which

is a limited liability commercial company (sociedade anónimas) established for the exclusive


-----

purpose of carrying out securitization transactions in accordance with Decree-Law no. 453/99, of
November 5, 1999 (the “Securitization Law”). Hefesto is subject to the supervision of the CMVM
and its incorporation was subject to prior authorization by the CMVM.

The acquisition of qualifying holdings in Hefesto is subject to prior notification to the

CMVM. The CMVM may oppose the proposed acquisition if it considers that the proposed
acquisition does not contribute to sound and prudent management of the company. This also
applies to the indirect acquisition of qualifying holdings.

The Securitization Law provides that members of the board of directors and members of

the supervisory board must be registered with the CMVM and must meet certain standards as
regards their professional qualifications and personal reputation. Hefesto carries out securitization
transactions by means of the acquisition of loans and the issue of debt securities (securitization
notes) to finance the payment of the purchase price for the acquired loans. The securitization notes
are subscribed by investors and include our group and third-party investors.

Once transferred to Hefesto, the loans constitute a segregate estate allocated exclusively to

the issuance of the securitization notes, under a complete segregation of assets/liabilities principle
(património autónomo), and will therefore only be available to satisfy the claims of the holders of
the Notes (according to the applicable priorities) and other creditors of the Issuer do not have any
right of recourse over the loans portfolio until there has been a full discharge of the Issuer’s
liabilities towards the holders of the Notes and the other transaction creditors. The rights of the
holders of the Notes regarding the payment of principal and interest (together with the rights of
the other transaction creditors) rank senior to the rights of any other creditor of Hefesto in relation
to the loans that back the relevant notes. The loans will therefore not be available to creditors of
Hefesto other than the holders of the Notes (and other transaction-related creditors) until there has
been a full discharge of the Issuer’s liabilities towards the noteholders and the other transaction
creditors. The holders of the Notes are also not entitled to claim against Hefesto’s own funds or
the assets backing other notes issued by Hefesto.

Whitestar acts as servicer for securitization transactions made under the Securitization Law

and is to such extent also subject to supervision by the CMVM. The Securitization Law provides
that whenever the originator is a credit institution, servicing of the securitized loans shall in
principle be carried out by the originator on behalf of Hefesto. However, in duly justified cases,
the CMVM may authorize that servicing to be carried out by an entity other than the originator,
such as Whitestar. Such authorization will depend on the evaluation of systems and experience of
the servicer.

Our purchase of non-paying loan portfolios from Portuguese credit institutions generally

are not considered to constitute a regulated activity in Portugal and, together with our engagements
of local agencies, fall under the general rules of the Portuguese Civil Code.

Portuguese laws applicable to consumer loan agreements (including the transposed EU

Directive described above), such as consumer credit regulations, prohibition on agreements being
on unfair terms and other statutory requirements continue to apply to the Portuguese loan portfolios
even after we have acquired them. The collection process in Portugal involves bringing judicial
proceedings, and courts might strike down certain clauses of the relevant credit agreements that


-----

are considered to be in breach of consumer credit regulations and other local statutory
requirements, or deemed to be unfair terms.

We must comply with local law on personal data being, the GDPR, Law no. 58/2019 of

August 8, which ensures the implementation in Portugal of the GDPR, and Law no. 41/2004 of
August 18, which implements in Portugal the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC). Norfin
is authorized to manage undertakings for collective investment in property by CMVM which
supervises its activity and is subject to the local implementation of AIFMD and additional local
regulation.

**_The Netherlands_**

In the Netherlands, in order to act as an intermediary in respect of consumer credit and/or

mortgage credit and to offer consumer credit and/or mortgage credit (including activities relating
to the servicing of existing credit agreements granted by third parties), we must have and maintain
licenses granted by the AFM and the Vesting Group entities that have such licenses must comply
with ongoing requirements and rules of conduct. These ongoing requirements include: (i)
suitability and reliability of the (co)-policymakers; (ii) the competence of certain key employees;
and (iii) ethical management (integere bedrijfsvoering). The licensed Vesting Group entities also
are required to follow certain rules of conduct and should, among others, be affiliated with the
Office for Credit Registration (Bureau Krediet Registratie) and a qualified dispute authority
(geschilleninstantie) and keep proper administrative records of complaints.

Failure to meet these requirements can result in AFM disciplinary actions or sanctions such

as an instruction (aanwijzing) to adopt a certain course of action, an order for incremental penalty
payments (last onder dwangsom) or an administrative fine (boete). The AFM may impose other
specific sanctions including, but not limited to, resignation of one or more managing directors or
revocation of the license. Additionally, failure to meet certain of these requirements, including
licensure, could amount to a criminal offense pursuant to the Economic Offenses Act (Wet
_economische delicten)._

_Vesting Group_

The Vesting Group includes Dutch entities that are subject to the AFM regulatory

framework. One of these entities holds a license allowing it to grant and act as an intermediary
with respect to consumer credit and mortgage credit, and another one of these entities holds a
license allowing it to grant consumer credit. Additionally, a number of Dutch entities have been
registered as an “affiliated entity” (aangesloten instelling) of the Dutch company holding a license
to grant and act as an intermediary with respect to consumer credit and mortgage credit. The
licensed Dutch company is responsible for the affiliated entities’ compliance with the rules of
conduct and instructions given by the AFM. Each affiliated entity should be affiliated with the
Office for Credit Registration (Bureau Krediet Registratie).

_Guidelines_

In November 2016, the AFM published guidelines in relation to consumer credit and debt

collection servicers (Leidraad: Consumenten en Incassotrajecten). The AFM provided guidelines
on the responsibilities of consumer credit providers in case of payment delays and certain other


-----

risks associated with the sale and transfer of consumer credit receivables or credit agreements. In
such cases, according to the guidelines, the consumer credit lender must secure the interests of its
client after such transfer. Such measures should be contractually secured in the case of transfer of
the receivables or credit agreement. Consumer credit lenders are not required to follow the
guidelines and may use other solutions to focus on clients’ interests in case of payment delays in
accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

_Data protection_

We are required to comply with the data protection regulatory framework provided by the

GDPR, as well as associated rules, regulations and guidance issued by the relevant regulators on
national and European level.

The data protection regulatory framework imposes rules and restrictions on companies with

respect to the processing of personal data. Under these rules, personal data may only be processed
in a fair, lawful and transparent manner. This means the requirement (among others) that personal
data must be accurate and up to date, and may only be processed for legitimate purposes and not
be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Also, the processing of
personal data must be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing.
This includes for example storage limitation requirements.

Furthermore, companies are required to take appropriate security measures to protect the

personal data against loss (in a broad sense). Where third parties are being involved in the
processing of personal data, or where personal data is being transferred to other countries,
appropriate (contractual) arrangements must be put in place in accordance with the requirements
laid down in the data protection regulatory framework.

Failure to comply with the data protection regulatory framework can result in

administrative fines (under the GDPR up to €20 million or up to four percent of the total worldwide
annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), as well as criminal charges,
breach of contract and damages actions, prohibitions on processing personal data, and reputational
damage.

**_Italy_**

The Zenith Group’s main business is carrying out servicing activity in Italy, including:

management and collection of receivables; cash and payment services in relation to securitizations;
and assessment of compliance of securitization transactions with the applicable regulatory
framework, jointly with other non-regulated activities. For this reason, the Zenith Group is subject
to regulation under Article 106 of Legislative Decree September 1, 1993, No. 385, as amended
(the “Italian Banking Act”).

Before granting authorization under Article 106, the Bank of Italy carries out an assessment

of the applicant and its business plan, including, among others, the integrity, fairness and
professional requirements that the members of the corporate bodies must meet; the shareholding
structure; the financial soundness and the business plan. After obtaining the necessary
authorization, financial intermediaries are subject to ongoing supervision by the competent


-----

authorities and are required to comply with various regulatory requirements concerning the
following matters, among others:

    - _Prudential capital requirements: Certain provisions of EU Regulation No. 575/2013,_

as amended, concerning own funds apply; different prudential ratio apply depending
on the type of activities which are carried out (for example, intermediaries that collect
deposits are subject to stricter rules).

    - _Approval requirements for the acquisition of qualified shareholdings: The direct or_

indirect acquisition of a controlling stake, a considerable stake (i.e., a stake ascribing
voting rights or a share capital of at least 10%, 20%, 30% or 50%), or a stake enabling
the holder to exercise a significant influence over the intermediary’s management is
subject to prior authorization from the Bank of Italy.

    - _Corporate governance: The members of corporate bodies are required: to have_

adequate experience in the financial sectors, to be without a criminal record, to be
independent of family or professional connections with members of other corporate
bodies, and to not hold similar offices in competing companies. Moreover, the
corporate governance model must ensure the efficiency and fairness of the management
and the effectiveness of the internal controls.

    - _Policies and procedures concerning internal audit, risk management and outsourcing:_

The internal controls must consist of rules, processes and policies that ensure
compliance of the business with the applicable laws and regulations and that entail
assessment of the suitability of the overall internal control system and the IT
infrastructure on an ongoing basis.

    - _Supervisory reporting: The Bank of Italy performs its supervisory tasks through an_

extensive analysis of the information periodically provided (statistical, accounting and
administrative).

Failure to meet these requirements typically results in the Bank of Italy taking disciplinary

action, such as special inspections (in addition to the routine inspections that the authorities
periodically carry out) and other types of assessments, which can result in criminal and
administrative sanctions and, in the case of major breaches, revocation of the firm’s authorization.
Specifically, the authorization can be revoked for the following reasons: serious irregularities in
the management of the intermediary or serious breaches of applicable law, regulations or statutory
provisions; expected serious capital losses; and justified requests of revocation from the
management bodies, the shareholders (i.e., the resolution at an extraordinary shareholders’
meeting), and/or the special administrator or liquidator.

The revocation of the authorization entails the winding up of the intermediary. During the

winding up, which is governed by an ad hoc program, the Bank of Italy can authorize
intermediaries to continue doing business on a pro-tempore basis, when required by specific
circumstances that are assessed on a case-by-case basis. If the Bank of Italy determines an orderly
liquidation is not possible, it may place the financial intermediary under compulsory administrative
liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa). Compulsory administrative liquidation entails,


-----

among others, the dissolution and replacement of the corporate bodies and the appointment of a
monitoring committee by the Bank of Italy.

The Bank of Italy is also entitled to carry out inspections to assess compliance with the

applicable regulatory requirements, including in relation to the accuracy of the data provided,
and/or to gain deeper knowledge of the intermediary and its business operations. If more areas for
improvement are identified, the Bank of Italy can issue specific recommendations on the measures
to be adopted; it then carries out a follow-up inspection to monitor progress. Conversely, if an
irregularity or breach of applicable regulations is discovered, the Bank of Italy can begin a
sanctioning procedure against the legal entity and/or the corporate officers deemed liable for the
irregularity/breach.

**_Data protection_**

We are required to comply with the data protection regulatory framework provided by

Regulation (UE) 2016/679 and the IDPC, taking into consideration the principles of lawfulness,
correctness and relevance of data processing, and with the related best practices for collection of
receivables, as set out in the Data Protection and Privacy Authority Act of November 30, 2005 as
well as other decisions and guidelines issued by such authority (inter alia, guidelines for
complying with data protection laws and regulations in the context of the collection of receivables
(issued on April 18, 2016) and guidelines regarding with pre-recorded messages on phone calls
made with the aim of the collection of receivables (issued on October 13, 2013)). The Data
Protection and Privacy Authority is an independent governmental authority that was set up to
protect fundamental rights in connection with the processing of personal data; it carries out the
following tasks, among others:

    - verifying that the data processing is carried out in compliance with the applicable law

and regulations and the related notification, including in relation to the termination of
processing and the retention of traffic data;

    - receiving reports and complaints; it is also required to take the appropriate steps with

regard to complaints lodged by other data subjects or by the associations representing
them;

    - instructing data controllers/processors to adopt measures as necessary or appropriate to

ensure the processing complies with the applicable law and regulations;

    - prohibiting unlawful or unfair data processing, in whole or in part, or blocking such

processing operations, and taking other measures as provided for by applicable law;
and

    - giving opinions whenever required.

Failure to comply with the IDPC can entail administrative fines, criminal charges, breach

of contract and damages actions, prohibition on processing personal data, and reputational damage.


-----

**_Anti-money laundering_**

We are required to comply with Legislative Decree No. 231 of November 21, 2007, as

amended, and the related implementing regulations, pointing out the anti-money laundering and
antiterrorism duties. Failure to comply can entail, for both the individual involved and the firm,
administrative fines, criminal charges, temporary prohibition on the corporate officers from
holding similar positions in the firm, cease and desist orders, and public admissions of the breach.

**_Ireland_**

_Regulation of credit servicing firms_

The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (the “Irish

**CSA 2015”) entered into force in 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Irish CSA 2015, certain**
borrowers of regulated entities (whose loans are sold) are afforded the same protection to which
they would have been entitled had their loans not been sold. The Irish CSA 2015 makes certain
amendments to the Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2015 (the “CBAs”) and the Consumer Credit Act
1995 (the “Irish CCA”). The Irish CSA 2015 amended the CBA 1997 to expand the definition of
“regulated financial service providers” to encompass a new type of regulated entity, namely credit
servicing firms. A further amendment to the CBA 1997 was made by way of the Consumer
Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 (the “Irish CSA 2018”) which had
the effect of requiring otherwise unregulated legal title holders of credit agreements to also become
authorized as credit servicing firms.

Credit servicing firms come within the definition of “regulated business” under the CBA

1997, as amended by the Irish CSA 2015 and Irish CSA 2018, and are therefore required under
the CBA 1997 to obtain authorization from the CBI in order to provide credit servicing activities
(as outlined below).

A credit servicing firm includes (i) a person who (a) undertakes credit servicing other than

on behalf of a regulated financial service provider authorized, by the CBI or an authority that
performs functions in an EEA country that are comparable to the functions performed by the CBI,
to provide credit in Ireland, or (b) holds the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement in
respect of which credit servicing is not being undertaken by a person authorized to carry on the
business of a credit servicing firm, and (ii) is a regulated financial services provider authorized to
carry on the business of a credit servicing firm in accordance with the CBA 1997.

Under the CBA 1997, “credit servicing,” in relation to a credit agreement, means holding

the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement, managing or administering a credit
agreement, including: (i) notifying the relevant borrower of changes in interest rates or in payments
due under the credit agreement or other matters of which the credit agreement requires the relevant
borrower to be notified; (ii) taking any necessary steps for the purposes of collecting or recovering
payments due under the credit agreement from the relevant borrower; and (iii) managing or
administering any of the following:

    - repayments under the credit agreement;

    - any charges imposed on the relevant borrower under the credit agreement;


-----

    - any errors made in relation to the credit agreement;

    - any complaints made by the relevant borrower;

    - information or records relating to the relevant borrower in respect of the credit

agreement;

    - the process by which a relevant borrower’s financial difficulties are addressed;

    - any alternative arrangements for repayment or other restructuring;

    - assessment of the relevant borrower’s financial circumstances and ability to repay

under the credit agreement;

    - determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a

portfolio or credit agreement; and

    - maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio.

Under the CBA 1997, “credit servicing” also includes communicating with relevant

borrowers in respect to any of the above listed matters.

_Consumer Protection in Ireland_

The Consumer Protection Act 2007 of Ireland (the “CPA”) came into force in 2007. The

CPA implements the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive in Ireland. Under the CPA, there are
four principal heads of offenses: Unfair Commercial Practices, Misleading Commercial Practices,
Aggressive Commercial Practices and Prohibited Commercial Practices.

In respect of most offenses (other than, for example, pyramid selling schemes), the CPA

contains a defense of “due diligence.” This defense is available where the accused proves the
commission of the offense was due to a mistake or the reliance on information supplied to the
accused or to the act or default of another person, an accident of some other cause beyond the
accused’s control, and that the accused exercised due diligence and took all reasonable precautions
to avoid the commission of the offense. Due diligence means the standard of special skill and care
which a trader may reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers, commensurate with
honest market practice and/or the general principle of good faith in trader’s field of activity.

Under the CPA, both civil proceedings and criminal proceedings may be brought against a

trader engaging in an unfair act or practice albeit this should not impact on the enforceability of
the underlying contract itself.

Any affected person, including consumers, other traders, and the Competition and

Consumer Protection Commission (“CCPC”) may bring civil proceedings under the CPA for a
prohibition order against a trader engaging in an unfair act or practice. The CCPC may also serve
a compliance notice on a trader whom it considers to have engaged in an unfair commercial
practice. A consumer aggrieved by an unfair commercial practice also has a right of action for
damages.


-----

The CCPC is also empowered to institute summary proceedings for breaches of the CPA

relating to misleading, aggressive and prohibited practices. A trader found guilty of an offense on
summary conviction will be liable to a fine not exceeding €3,000 and/or six months imprisonment
for a first offense and a fine of €5,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment for subsequent offenses.
Proceedings on indictment will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the “DPP”). On
a first conviction on indictment an offending trader may be fined up to €60,000 and/or 18 months
imprisonment and subsequent convictions carry a fine of up to €100,000 and/or 24 months
imprisonment.

The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is stated to be without prejudice to contract

law and the rules of the validity, formation or effect of a contract. There is, as yet, no reported case
law on the CPA.

_Conduct of Business Rules applicable to Credit Servicing Firms_

_Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears_

The CCMA is a legally binding code published by the CBI on the handling of mortgage

arrears and pre-arrears. A pre-arrears case arises where a borrower contacts the relevant lender to
inform them that he/she is in danger of going into financial difficulties and/or is concerned about
going into mortgage arrears or when the relevant lender itself identifies that this is likely to occur.

The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of lenders to borrowers in respect of

their primary residence or in respect of the only residential property in Ireland owned by the
borrower and accordingly will apply to the activities of Mars Capital Ireland in its capacity as a
credit servicing firm, in its servicing of such mortgages. The CCMA sets out what the lender must
do when managing mortgage arrears and pre-arrears cases and provides for, among others, the
actions a lender is required to take to address mortgage arrears before resorting to repossession of
the relevant property.

As the CCMA applies to borrowers in respect of their primary residence or where it is the

only residential property owned by them in Ireland, the protections afforded by the CCMA should
not apply to buy to let mortgages.

_Consumer Protection Code_

The revised Consumer Protection Code (the “CPC”) came in to force in 2012 and was

subsequently amended in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019. The Consumer Protection Code sets out how
lending institutions must deal with personal consumers, who are defined as natural persons acting
outside his/her business, trade or profession, and with consumers, who are natural persons or
groups of natural persons acting for personal and/or business purposes or incorporated bodies
having an annual turnover of €3 million or less in the previous financial year (provided that such
body is not a member of a group of companies having a combined turnover of greater than the said
€3 million). Mars Capital Ireland will be subject to compliance with the requirements of the CPC
in its capacity as a credit servicing firm. The CPC does not apply to a mortgage loan to which the
CCMA applies, but it could apply to a mortgage not in respect of a primary residence, including a
buy to let mortgage.

_Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)_

The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to

Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 were published in 2015. In 2016, the
Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 were published (the “SME
**Regulations”). The SME Regulations replaced the existing SME Code, from July 1, 2016, for**
regulated lenders. On January 25, 2018, further technical amendments to the SME Regulations
were published concerning the definitions of SMEs and took effect immediately. Due to the
introduction of new provisions in the SME Regulations in respect to the arrears management and
complaints handling of SMEs, Mars Capital Ireland will be subject to compliance with the
requirements of the SME Regulations in its capacity as a credit servicing firm if it is servicing
SME loans originated after July 1, 2016.

_Mars Capital Ireland_

In Ireland, in order to manage or service credit agreements in respect of consumer credit

and/or mortgage credit (or post July 1, 2016, SME credit), Mars Capital Ireland must have and
maintain an authorization granted by the CBI under Part V of the CBA 1997 (as amended by the
Irish CSA 2015 and Irish CSA 2018) to provide credit servicing activities. In addition, Mars
Capital Ireland must comply with statutory obligations under the GDPR and the Irish Data
Protection Acts and any binding guidance and/or codes or practice issued by the DPC or the EDPB.

_Anti-Money Laundering_

Mars Capital Ireland is a regulated financial service provider authorized under Irish law

and so it is required to have policies, procedures and internal controls in place to prevent and detect
money laundering and terrorist financing, in order to comply with the Criminal Justice (Money
Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended (the “CJA 2010”) (which transposes
Directive (EU) 2015/849 (as further amended by Directive (EU) 2018/843) into Irish law).

**Our Risk Management and Compliance**

**_Risk Management Framework_**

At the center of our risk management framework is our values and the culture embedded

within the Group. Effective risk management is closely aligned to our strategic goal of building
better financial futures, while our three lines of defense model enables all colleagues to own and
manage risk in a manner, which supports well-informed decision-making with a view to mitigating
risks.

Our enterprise-wide risk management framework defines a common approach across the

whole organization. The framework is based upon our three core risk categories: strategic,
financial and operational, with related details cascading from these areas, and is continually
monitored and reviewed to ensure it remains suitable for the size, scale and complexity of our
business. This framework includes:

     - Embedding the three lines of defense throughout the firm;


-----

     - Ensuring clarity of roles and responsibilities;

     - The establishment of defined risk appetite levels;

     - Risk management aimed at understanding risks and enabling proportionate risk

mitigation plans;

     - Controls to address new and emerging risks;

     - Recognition and maintenance of operational risk and resilience plans; and

     - Escalation and risk reporting.

**_Governance of Risk Management_**

The risk framework and risk management is governed via our Risk Committee, which is

supported by the Group Executive Risk Committee and country risk committees alongside
functional risk reports. We continue to embed and mature risk management processes which
effectively identify, report, measure and manage risk. Risk committees, within each jurisdiction
that we operate, continue to be run independently and focus on our country-based regulatory status.
This approach allows for risks to be raised and mitigated with accountability where it is needed.

Key areas of our risk framework are covered by the risk and information security teams

who discharge their responsibilities with strong policies and procedures dealing with, among other
matters, enterprise and operational risk, investment and financial risk, regulatory compliance and
cyber risk, information security and data privacy.

Delivering on our commitments relies on the ability to successfully identify, assess,

respond, monitor and report on risks and opportunities. There is an ongoing focus on the top risks
which could impact the business, alongside horizon scanning and monitoring of macro, geopolitical and other emerging risks that may affect the business or wider sector in the future. People
and infrastructure commitments are in place to support these processes, ensuring increased
consistency across the Group. We believe that our risk culture, aligned to our values, is a
commercial differentiator and our ability to deploy Group-wide or country-specific expertise,
when required, is a core element of our approach.

The ongoing investment in a risk management system facilitates the evolution of our risk

culture, helping to support a proactive and consistent approach to the identification and
management of risks. Notably, it provides transparency and allows for actions across all three lines
of defense to be addressed promptly and managed to completion via a single data source, with
additional oversight through the risk committee structure, audit committee and via local regulated
board meetings to gather additional insights on their respective control environments.

**_Three lines of defense model_**

We operate a three lines of defense model that allows us to operationalize our approach,

driving clear accountability into the first line, with senior managers (as defined in “Regulation and
_Compliance—Regulatory Framework—United Kingdom—Senior Managers and Certification_


-----

_Regime”) retaining approved person status where applicable._ This enables a formalized approach
to responsibility and ensures embedded behaviors support the long-term sustainability of the
business through increased accountability, which is exercised within a framework of high
governance standards. This has been particularly evident with the establishment of the Senior
Managers and Certification Regime in the UK, which has provided rigor to the structured approach
already adopted. It has formalized the basis around which decisions are taken and executed whilst
ensuring we maintain a focus on customer conduct issues throughout all parts of the business. This
is an approach that runs through our culture and values and is, therefore, evident in our businesses,
which operate in different regulatory regimes. A summary of the roles and responsibilities relevant
to each of the three lines of defense model are shown below:

_First line business owners_

  - Responsible for ownership and accountability of risk management;

  - Day-to-day ownership, management and reporting of risks;

  - First line implementation and quality control to ensure adherence to risk framework and

processes; and

  - Responsible for control environment.

_Second line risk and compliance_

  - Provide oversight and challenge;

  - Act as a business partner and regulatory interface by way of providing advice, consultation

and communication;

  - Develop and maintain risk framework and partnership with first line business owners; and

  - Provide oversight, monitoring and challenge to provide assurance to relevant boards and

governance forums.

_Third line internal audit_

  - Provide independent assurance through formal reviews; and

  - Review and challenge the first and second lines of defense.

The third line defense internal audit activity is delivered by the Group Head of Internal

Audit with support from country audit teams and an external outsource provider, Deloitte LLP.
The Group Head of Internal Audit reports to the audit committee, which ensures a clear distinction


-----

between responsibilities in the second and third lines, and is an attendee at the Group Executive
Risk Committee and the Risk Committee.

**_Risk-related focus risk during 2020_**

The assessment and management of risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic dominated

the risk management agenda in 2020. Due to the wide-ranging nature of the risks posed, these
elements have been addressed across all areas of the risk profile, including, at different stages,
those that related to our customers, clients, colleagues, financial risks or investment strategy. See
“Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our Operations— _Our business, financial condition, cash_
_flows and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-_
_19 pandemic.”_

In addition, the following areas were of particular focus during 2020:

_Development of the Fund and Investment Management business_

Risk and compliance teams were fully involved throughout the process of launching and

developing the Fund and Investment Management business in line with our stated ambition to
realize opportunities to deploy third-party capital. In 2020, our focus was on investment risk
appetite monitoring and reporting with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring
regulatory compliance matters were addressed with internal and external experts working in
tandem, enhancing processes to support the operating model, and ensuring governance and
delegated authorities were restructured to meet the new requirements.

_Brexit_

We maintained a watching brief on Brexit developments during 2020, whilst continuing to

benefit from our multi-jurisdictional base provided by our existing footprint. Whilst this meant
cross-border regulatory issues were less challenging given our individual country-based
permissions and relationships, Brexit still posed a risk to data flows as well as the impacts on
working and travel arrangements for colleagues. The COVID-19 pandemic may have reduced the
immediacy of the latter’s challenge, however it was still prevalent, with targeted information
provided to colleagues on the implications of Brexit for them and their personal circumstances.
We continued to take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves based on the work of internal subject
matter experts supported by external advisors. The individual operating licenses held by our
individual businesses, alongside our balance sheet strength, meant that we were well positioned to
navigate a range of Brexit outcomes. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Relating to our Operations—
_Legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the nature of the future_
_relationship between the UK and the European Union is likely to be a source of instability in_
_international markets, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business_
_and result in new regulatory challenges and costs.”_

_Regulatory scrutiny_

Our widespread footprint, both geographically and in terms of asset class coverage, means

that we experience a broad spread of regulatory interactions across our compliance framework.
This involves all parts of the business, both functionally and at all levels, which means strong


-----

engagement and deep understanding of our regulatory role as well as colleagues’ individual
responsibilities. Regulatory compliance is one of the pillars of our business; learning from the bestin-class across the Group to develop and achieve the same standards in all businesses and placing
the customer journey and customer impact assessments at the heart of how we operate.

Whilst other regulators move progressively towards the approach, standards and

framework of the FCA in the UK, we are well placed to meet and surpass these standards elsewhere
because of the approach we already adopt. The embedding of the Senior Manager and Certification
Regime during 2020 is a prime example of this approach that was adopted at Group level. While
we continue to maintain full focus on future developments from the Debt Respite Scheme
Regulations in the UK to the Senior Executive Accountability Regime in Ireland and the AML
Directives which affect all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. COVID-19 brought the
treatment of customers, and especially those who may be more vulnerable, into sharp focus for all
organizations. For us, this represented a continuation of our approach to treating customers fairly
and responding to individual needs and so we were well positioned to work with our customers
and regulators as the pandemic evolved.

_Information security and operational resilience_

A fundamental area of operational risk management and operational resilience is our

approach to information security. We benchmark our minimum information security standards
against the international standard of good practice for information security, ISO 27001. Our
framework involves identifying our critical data and applying the relevant protection controls to
safeguard such data. We acknowledge, however, that the cyber-risk landscape is continually
evolving, and in response to this, we are investing in our people, processes and technology in order
to protect our colleagues, customers and clients, as well as to strengthen our ability to detect,
respond to, and recover from cyber threats. Given that cyber-attacks are inevitable, we continue to
focus on deploying resources, training our personnel and building up our technological resilience.
We utilize a number of systems, such as Netscope, Mimecast and Okta to respond to potential
cyber threats made via the web and our internal email and authentication systems.

Although cyber risk forms a critical component of our operational resilience and scenario

testing, we acknowledge that it is not the only business disruptor that can have a significant impact
on our operations. As such, the development and strengthening of our business operating model
encompasses the development of our culture, processes and systems such that our business is best
placed to perform in line with our strategy in the face of disruption, regardless of the source of
such disruption. This holistic approach to the development of the systems involved in our business
will enable us to anticipate, protect and plan for operation recovery. Our approach to business
continuity for our IT infrastructure is to ensure that our systems are “always on,” enabled by our
use of cloud-based data centers. As such, in the event of a system breakdown, we expect to be able
to recover all systems within approximately two hours with only minimal transaction history data
loss.

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

The Issuer is a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of England

and Wales and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent. Each of Finco and Bidco are private
limited liability companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and are wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Parent. The issued and outstanding share capital of the Parent is
indirectly controlled by TDR Capital.

The Issuer, Finco and Bidco were incorporated as holding companies for the purpose of

the Acquisition of the Target Group by entities controlled by TDR Capital. Following reregistration as a private company subsequent to the completion of the Acquisition, the Target is a
private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Following the
completion of the Acquisition, Bidco owns 100% of the outstanding voting shares of the Target.

TDR Capital is a leading private equity firm with over €10 billion of assets under

management as of August 31, 2021 and is based in the UK. TDR Capital has an experienced team
of investment professionals and operating partners and has a low-volume investment strategy
based on principles developed by the investment team over the past decade. TDR Capital seeks to
spend significant resources on each investment and to focus on operational excellence through a
tested and integrated operating partner model.

Intense pre-investment analysis and post-investment involvement mean that TDR Capital

is selective, typically making only one to three investments a year. TDR Capital takes an active
role in overseeing the operations of its investments, working in partnership with management
through board representation and professional support.

To date, TDR Capital has completed multiple investments across the funds, business and

financial services sectors. Some examples of current and prior TDR Capital investments include
TDR’s successful investments in Lowell Group, LeasePlan and Phoenix Group. TDR Capital
helped oversee the growth of Lowell Group, a debt purchaser of unsecured debt, as its owner from
2011 until 2015, and developed an in-depth understanding of the value drivers and regulation
relevant to the industry. TDR Capital’s experienced team of investment professionals and
operating partners has had a longstanding historical focus on financial services and business
services, as evidenced by its March 2016 investment in LeasePlan, the world’s leading fleet
management and driver mobility company.

In connection with the Transactions, TDR Capital has injected £513 million indirectly in

the form of equity into the Parent as part of the Equity Contribution.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements

after giving effect to the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to be complete or
describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the underlying documents. In addition, capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this section shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the same meanings set out
in the underlying debt documents, as applicable. Capitalized terms defined in this section shall
specifically have the meaning given to them in this section and not in the other sections of this
Offering Memorandum.

**Revolving Facility Agreement**

The Revolving Facility Agreement dated October 6, 2021 provides for a multicurrency

revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of £285,000,000 (the “Revolving Facility”). The
Revolving Facility may be drawn by way of cash advances or the issue of letters of credit or
ancillary facilities. The Revolving Facility is permitted to be used for financing, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, any amount payable under or in connection with the Acquisition
and related transactions, the refinancing, purchasing or otherwise discharging any indebtedness of
the Target Group and transaction costs. In addition, the Revolving Facility may be used towards
financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or the working capital requirements
of the restricted group (including for any acquisitions or capital expenditure).

In addition, the Parent, in its capacity as obligors’ agent may elect to request additional

facilities either as a new facility or as additional tranches of the Revolving Facility (the “Revolving
**Incremental Facilities”). The Parent and the lenders in respect of the Revolving Incremental**
Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the Revolving Incremental Facilities, including
the margin and the termination date (subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving Facility
Agreement). The indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Incremental Facilities must be
otherwise permitted under the Revolving Facility Agreement.

**_Maturity and Availability Period_**

The Revolving Facility matures 54 months after the Acquisition Completion Date.

The Revolving Facility is available to be drawn from and including the date of the

Revolving Facility Agreement up to and including one (1) month prior to the maturity date
specified in the paragraph above.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Facility Agreement initially bear interest at the aggregate of

3.25% per annum and (in the case of Loans in USD) LIBOR, or (in the case of loans in Euros)
EURIBOR or (in the case of Loans in pounds sterling) SONIA-based rate plus a credit adjustment
spread, as applicable.

Following expiry of two full quarter periods from the date of first drawdown of the

Revolving Facility, the margin for each loan under the Revolving Facility Agreement is subject to


-----

adjustment by reference to the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as shown in the quarterly
financial statements or, as the case may be, the annual financial statements for the relevant period
and the related compliance certificate, to equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:

**Revolving Facility margin**

**Consolidated senior secured leverage ratio** **(% p.a.)**

Greater than 4.00:1.00 .................................................................................................................... 3.25

Equal to or less than 4.00:1.00 but greater than 3.50:1.00 .............................................................. 3.00

Equal to or less than 3.50:1.00........................................................................................................ 2.75

Following an initial public offering ................................................................................................ 2.50

The margin on any loans under the Revolving Incremental Facilities will be agreed between

the Parent and the relevant lenders.

If LIBOR, EURIBOR or SONIA (as applicable) is less than zero, LIBOR, EURIBOR or

SONIA (as applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan under the Revolving
Facility Agreement.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncanceled amount of the

Revolving Facility for the relevant periods set out in the Revolving Facility Agreement at a rate of
30% of the applicable margin per annum. Generally, the commitment fee is payable quarterly in
arrears, on the last day of availability of the Revolving Facility and if cancelled, on the cancelled
amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the Revolving Facility at the time such
cancelation is effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on any overdue amount. The

Parent is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency fees in connection
with the Revolving Facility.

**_Repayment_**

All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility are required to be repaid on the

relevant maturity date referred to above.

Loans under the Revolving Facility must be repaid on the last day of the interest period

relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against new loans under the Revolving Facility to
be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of any Revolving Incremental Facilities will be the date

agreed between the Parent and the relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a

minimum amount and certain conditions).


-----

The Revolving Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory

prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Parent or a sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Group.

**_Guarantees_**

The Revolving Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer.

The Revolving Facility Agreement includes a “Guarantor Coverage Threshold” (being,

subject to certain exceptions, the requirement that the consolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors
represents not less than 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the members of the Restricted Group
excluding any member of the Restricted Group that is not required to become a guarantor in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles). If the Guarantor Coverage Threshold is not met
when tested by reference to delivery of the annual financial statements of the Parent for the relevant
year, within 60 days, each Material Company (as defined herein) that is not already a guarantor
(together with such other members of the Restricted Group within Security Jurisdictions (as
defined herein) as necessary) shall become guarantors under the Revolving Facility Agreement in
order to meet the Guarantor Coverage Threshold at that time. “Material Company” is generally
defined under the Revolving Facility Agreement to include, among other things, any member of
the Restricted Group that is incorporated or established in a Security Jurisdiction or the Portuguese
Entities (as defined herein) and that has earnings from ordinary activities before interest, tax,
depreciation amortization and exceptional items representing more than 5% of consolidated
EBITDA of the Restricted Group. “Portuguese Entities” are defined in the Revolving Facility
Agreement as AGHL Portugal Investment Holdings, S.A. and Whitestar Asset Solutions, S.A.,
and “Security Jurisdiction” is defined in the Agreed Security Principles as being England and
Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Netherlands. The Agreed Security Principles provide, among
other things, that no member of the Restricted Group incorporated or established outside of a
Security Jurisdiction shall be required to provide any guarantee or security (unless such member
is a borrower of the Revolving Facility) and no member of the Restricted Group shall be required
to provide any security in respect of any shares or other ownership interests held in any member
of the Restricted Group incorporated or established outside of a Security Jurisdiction or any
member of the Restricted Group which is not an obligor under the Revolving Facility Agreement,
and that the Portuguese Entities shall only be required to provide guarantees (not security).

**_Security_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement is secured by the same security interests granted as

security for the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and

warranties (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and
warranties being repeated), including (but not limited to) status, binding obligations, non-conflict
with other obligations, power and authority, authorizations, no default, governing law and
enforcement, sanctions and anti-corruption laws.


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related

definitions (with certain adjustments) that are included in the section entitled “Description of the
_Notes—Certain covenants” and “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants.” In addition, the_
Revolving Facility Agreement contains a financial covenant (see “—Financial Covenant”).

The Revolving Facility Agreement also contains a “notes purchase condition” covenant.

Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Parent may not, and
shall procure that no other member of the Restricted Group will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease,
redeem or otherwise acquire or retire the principal amount of the Notes (but excluding any amount
outstanding under any “finance document” entered into in respect of the Revolving Facility
Agreement) prior to its scheduled repayment date in any manner which involves the payment of
cash consideration by a member of the Restricted Group to a person which is not a member of the
Restricted Group. The exceptions to such covenant include, inter alia, generally, payments that do
not exceed 50% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Notes in existence as of the date
of their issuance or incurred at any time after their issuance.

The Revolving Facility Agreement also requires certain members of the Restricted Group

to observe certain affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of Guarantor
Coverage Threshold on an annual basis (see “—Guarantees” above) and further assurance with
respect to security interests granted.

Certain of the covenants under the Revolving Facility Agreement will be suspended,

including upon the long-term corporate credit rating of the Parent (or any holding company of the
Parent) being equal to or better than Baa3 or BBB-, according to Moody’s Investor Services, Inc.
and Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services, respectively.

The Revolving Facility Agreement also contains an “information covenant” under which,

among other things, the Parent is required to deliver to Global Loan Agency Services Limited
(acting as facility agent pursuant to the Revolving Facility Agreement) annual financial statements,
quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement requires that the consolidated leverage ratio in respect

of each period of twelve months ending on any quarter date (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”)
shall not be greater than 7.00:1.00 provided that this financial covenant is only to be tested if on
the last day of such period, the amount of loans drawn under the Revolving Facility is greater than
40% of the total Revolving Facility commitments.

The Parent is permitted (subject to certain conditions) to prevent or cure breaches of the

Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant by applying a “cure” amount (generally, amounts received
by the Parent in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if consolidated
EBITDA had been increased by such amount or consolidated leverage had been reduced by such
amount. There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Revolving
Facility. No more than four different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the maturity


-----

date of the Revolving Facility Agreement and cure amounts in consecutive financial quarters are
not permitted.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement contains a limited number of events of default

(misrepresentation, unlawfulness, failure to comply with the financial covenant (subject to cure)),
subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods and other qualifications. Additionally, the
Revolving Facility Agreement mirrors the events of default applicable to the Notes.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Facility Agreement is governed by English law (with certain covenants,

information undertakings and events of default being governed by New York law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements,

the Parent, the Issuer and certain other members of the Group which have acceded or otherwise
become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor (together the “Debtors”) are parties to
the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, Global Loan Agency Services Limited as
Revolving Agent and Senior Bridge Agent and Sherwood Parentco Limited as the parent as
amended and/or restated from time to time. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English
law and sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors,
the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be made in
respect of certain debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that
indebtedness, the terms pursuant to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon
the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions.

(c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other

Secured Parties than, those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if
any), in each case as at the date such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant
member(s) of the Group and as determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be
conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided
with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility
consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation
to the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Liabilities as set out under the captions

_to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors.”_

-----

other member of the Group will, make any payment of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities at any time unless that payment is permitted by the provisions set out below under the
captions “Permitted Second Lien Payments,” “Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,”
“Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” or by a refinancing of the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Permitted Second Lien Payments_

Prior to the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, any

member of the Group may make payments with respect to the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Second Lien Payments”):

(a) if:

(i) the payment is of:

(A) any of the principal amount of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being paid by the

on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities (subject to certain conditions); or

Senior Notes Trustee and the Majority Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the
Permitted Senior Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Senior Financing
Debt (as applicable) (the “Required Senior Consent”) give prior consent to that payment
being made;

(c) if the payment is of certain amounts due to the Permitted Second Lien Creditor
Representative for its own account;

(d) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation
or enforcement of such security;


-----

(e) of costs, commissions, taxes, fees and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or

(including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under such documents);

(f) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of any indebtedness
incurred under the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and/or Senior Parent
Notes;

(g) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of a Shareholder
Contribution or Subordinated Debt; or

(h) any other amount not exceeding £5,000,000 in aggregate in any financial year of the Parent.

On or after the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date,
the Debtors may make payments in respect of the Permitted Second Lien Financing

_Second Lien Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Super Senior

Consent) and the Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Senior Consent), no Debtor
shall make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group will make), and no
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor may receive from any other members of the Group, any
Permitted Second Lien Payment (other than roll-up or capitalization of any amount or certain
amounts due to the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative for its own account and subject
to certain other exceptions) if:

(a) a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) a Material Event of Default is continuing, from the date which is one business day after the
date on which any Revolving Agent or Senior Agent delivers a payment stop notice (a
“Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to
that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

  - the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

  - in relation to payments of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, if a Second

Lien Standstill Period is in effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

  - the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived in

accordance with the applicable Revolving Finance Documents or Senior Debt Documents,
as applicable;

  - the date on which the Revolving Agent or Senior Agent, as applicable, has delivered the

relevant Second Lien Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security


-----

Agent and the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative cancelling the Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice;

  - the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date have occurred; and

  - the date on which the Security Agent or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative

takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative waives this requirement, (i) a

new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have
elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Material
Event of Default more than 75 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Material
Event of Default.

The Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment

Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately
preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Material Event of

Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document

as a result of the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior
Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of
Default (as defined in any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document) as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Document;
(ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors; (iii) any debt-for-equity transaction in respect of Permitted
Second Lien Financing Liabilities; (iv) payment of advisory or professional fees in respect of
restructuring advice and/or valuations in respect of the Debtors provided to the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors not exceeding in aggregate £1,500,000; or (v) payment to the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors of fees in respect of amendments to, and consents or waivers of,
the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents in amounts not exceeding those paid to the Super
Senior Secured Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors in respect of amendments to, and
consents or waivers of, the Revolving Finance Documents and the Senior Debt Documents, as
applicable.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default

interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Permitted Second Lien Financing Document
by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption
“Restrictions Relating to Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and Permitted Second


-----

_Lien Financing Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time_
by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Permitted Second

Lien Financing Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice.

_Cure of Second Lien Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence
of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors an
amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Documents and which would have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but
for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment Default or Senior
Payment Default,

then any event or circumstance specified to be an “Event of Default” in any of the Debt

Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”) (including any cross default or similar provision
under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be waived, and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued
as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors or any other creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors_

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior

consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(a) no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or
otherwise require the enforcement of any security; and

(b) no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor shall take or require the taking of any
Enforcement Action in relation to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “Permitted
_Second Lien Enforcement.”_

_Option to Purchase: Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors

or Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Second


-----

Lien Financing Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under the Revolving Facility
Agreement (a “Revolving Acceleration Event”), a Senior Acceleration Event, the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice that is continuing or during a Second Lien Standstill Period that
is continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to
such Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and
obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities or the Senior Liabilities if:

(e) as a result of that transfer the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured
Creditors (as applicable) have no further actual or contingent liability to the Parent or any
other Debtor under the relevant debt documents;

(f) an indemnity is provided from each Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor (other than
any Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative) (or from another third party acceptable
to all the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable)) in
a form reasonably satisfactory to each Super Senior Secured Creditor or each Senior Secured
Creditor (as applicable) in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be
sustained or incurred by any Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor
(as applicable) in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Super Senior
Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) from any person being
required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any
Super Senior Secured Creditor or any Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) for any
reason; and

(g) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Super
Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors (as applicable), except that each
Super Senior Secured Creditor or each Senior Secured Creditor (as applicable) shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the
corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer.

At the request of a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (on behalf of all the

Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors), the relevant Revolving Agent and/or Senior Agent


-----

shall notify the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives of the foregoing payable sums in
connection with such transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, any of the Permitted Second Lien Financing

Creditors or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (on behalf of all the Permitted
Second Lien Financing Creditors) may, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security
Agent, require a transfer of the hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement if, at
the same time, they require a transfer of the Super Senior Liabilities or all the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditors (acting as a whole) require a transfer of the relevant hedging liabilities
at any time on or after the Super Senior Discharge Date or a Permitted Second Lien Financing
Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing or a Second Lien Standstill Period has
commenced and is continuing or a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice has been issued and is
continuing.

If the Security Agent has notified the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives that

it is enforcing security created pursuant to any security document over shares of a Second Lien
Borrower/Issuer or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor may

_Senior Parent Payment Blockage Provisions_

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Super Senior Consent),

the Senior Discharge Date (except with the Required Senior Consent) and the Permitted Second
Lien Financing Discharge Date (except with the Required Second Lien Consent), no Senior Parent


-----

Debt Issuer shall make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group will make),
and neither the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes, the Security Agent
or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group,
any Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than roll-up or capitalization of any amount or certain
amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account and subject to certain other
exceptions) if:

(a) a Super Senior Payment Default, a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default is continuing; or

(b) a Revolving Event of Default (other than a Super Senior Payment Default), a Senior Event
of Default (other than a Senior Payment Default) or a Permitted Second Lien Financing
Event of Default (other than a Second Lien Payment Default) is continuing, from the date
which is one business day after the date on which the Revolving Agent, any Senior Agent
and/or any Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative delivers a payment stop notice
(a “Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying
the event or circumstance in relation to that Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of
Default or Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default to the Parent, the Security
Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until
the earliest of:

  - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior

Parent Payment Stop Notice;

  - in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Liabilities, if a Senior Parent Standstill Period

is in effect at any time after delivery of that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

  - the date on which the relevant Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default and/or

Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the applicable Revolving Facility Agreement, Senior Debt Document or
Permitted Second Lien Financing Document;

  - the date on which the Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Permitted Second Lien Creditor

Representative which delivered the relevant Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior
Parent Payment Stop Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the
other Agents cancelling the Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

  - the Primary Discharge Date; and

  - the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent

Creditor Representative takes Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative

waive this requirement, (i) a new Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the


-----

immediately prior Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice; and (ii)
no Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/ Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the
Revolving Agent, a Senior Agent or a Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative in reliance
on a Revolving Event of Default, a Senior Event of Default or a Permitted Second Lien Financing
Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that Revolving Agent, Senior Agent or Permitted
Second Lien Creditor Representative received notice of that Revolving Event of Default, Senior
Event of Default or Permitted Second Lien Financing Event of Default.

The Revolving Agent, the Senior Agents and the Permitted Second Lien Creditor

Representatives may only serve one Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment
Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately
preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Revolving Agent, the Senior Agents
and/or the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representatives to issue a Super Senior/Senior/Second
Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served in

respect of a Revolving Event of Default, Senior Event of Default or Permitted Second Lien
Financing Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier
Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Finance Documents and any

Permitted Parent Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second
Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default, a
Senior Payment Default or a Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of
an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing
Agreement, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the
relevant Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents;
or (ii) the issue of a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior
Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from

the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue)
under any Senior Parent Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the
operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “Restrictions
_Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make_
such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent

Finance Document and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding
the issue of a Super Senior/ Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.


-----

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Super Senior Payment Default or a Senior
Payment Default, that Super Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the
Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any
Senior Parent Finance Document or any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which
would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Super

Senior/Senior/Second Lien/Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice, a Super Senior Payment
Default or Senior Payment Default, then any event or circumstance specified to be an
“Event of Default” in any of the Debt Financing Agreements (an “Event of Default”)
(including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which
may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived, and any
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of
Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part
of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the Senior Parent

Debt Issuer and the Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes Finance
Documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their terms at
any time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the Primary Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an

Instructing Group:

(a) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require
the enforcement of any security; and

(b) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of a Senior
Parent Debt Issuer under the Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents and/or Permitted
Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “Permitted Senior
_Parent Enforcement” provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need_
be taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor
Agreement to direct such action.


-----

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Senior Parent Agents (on behalf of the

Senior Parent Creditors) may, after a Revolving Acceleration Event, a Senior Acceleration Event
or a Permitted Second Lien Financing Acceleration Event, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice
to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Senior Parent Creditors of all, but not part, of the
rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Revolving Liabilities, the Senior Liabilities, the
Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (b) below, otherwise permitted by the terms
of the Revolving Facility Agreement (in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant
Senior Debt Documents (in the case of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Permitted
Second Lien Financing Documents (in the case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility
Liabilities) (as applicable);

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Revolving Facility Agreement
(in the case of the Revolving Liabilities), the relevant Senior Debt Documents (in the case
of the Senior Liabilities), the relevant Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents (in the
case of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility
Documents (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each
case, other than as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) each of the Revolving Agent (on behalf of the Revolving Lenders), the relevant Senior
Agent (on behalf of the relevant Senior Bridge Lenders, Senior Notes Creditors and the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors), is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(d) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(e) as a result of that transfer the Revolving Lenders, the Senior Bridge Lenders, the Senior
Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors, the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent
liability to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(f) an indemnity is provided from each Senior Parent Creditor (other than any Senior Parent
Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to the relevant creditors) in a form
reasonably satisfactory to each Revolving Lender, Senior Bridge Lender, Senior Notes
Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor
and Operating Facility Lender (as applicable) in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and
liabilities which may be sustained or incurred by any Revolving Lender, Senior Bridge
Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received
or recovered by any such party from any person being required (or it being alleged that it
is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Revolving Lender, Senior Bridge


-----

Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor, Permitted Second
Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; and

(g) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, any Revolving
Lender, Senior Bridge Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor,
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, except that each
of them shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that
it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to
authorize the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior

Parent Creditors) may only require a Super Senior Liabilities Transfer and a Senior Liabilities
Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the
Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, no Super Senior Liabilities Transfer or Senior Liabilities Transfer
may be required to be made.

At the request of a Senior Parent Agent (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors), the

Revolving Agent, the relevant Senior Agent, the Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative
and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Senior Parent Agents of the foregoing payable
sums in connection with such transfer.

_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_

The restrictions set out in the caption “Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent

_Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(a) a Senior Parent Event of Default (the “Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

(b) the Revolving Agent and each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior
Parent Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior
Parent Default from the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor
Representative, as the case may be;

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent
Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent

Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a
“Senior Parent Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Revolving Agent and each Senior
Agent of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean

the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior


-----

Parent Notes Trustee or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, serves a
Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Revolving Agent and the Senior Agents in
respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Primary Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior
**Parent Guarantor”); provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends**
pursuant to this paragraph, the Senior Parent Finance Parties may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action
taken by the Primary Secured Parties against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against
any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a
particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result
of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Revolving Agent (acting pursuant to a
Required Super Senior Consent), the Senior Agent (acting pursuant to a Required Senior
Consent) and any Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting pursuant to a
Required Second Lien Consent) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on any
Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding under the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing
Debt, as the case may be (provided that (i) unless the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required Super Senior Consent and agreed
by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85
months after the date of first utilization under the Revolving Facility Agreement, (ii) unless
the Senior Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required
Senior Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date
prior to the date falling 85 months after the after the date of first utilization of any
indebtedness under the Senior Debt Documents, and (iii) unless the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Discharge Date has occurred or is otherwise agreed pursuant to a Required
Second Lien Consent and agreed by the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on
a date prior to the date falling 97 months after the date of first utilization of any
indebtedness under the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents),

(the “Senior Parent Standstill Period”).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Notes Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set

out in caption “Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior


-----

Parent Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later
time, a further Senior Parent Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent
Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified each of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior

Parent Creditor Representative (collectively, the “Senior Parent Agents” and each, a “Senior
**Parent Agent”) that it is enforcing security created pursuant to any security document over shares**
of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor may take any action referred to under the
provisions set out under the caption “Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above against that
Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an

Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing,
any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that
member of the Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any creditor
or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise constitute
a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out under the caption “Turnover by
_the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent_
acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and
any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct
the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that
distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid
in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds.”

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are

discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
in relation to that member of the Group, any creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which
benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of any creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to
the extent that the relevant discharge constitutes a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the
provisions set out under the caption “Turnover by the Creditors” and, in all cases, if prior to a
distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing
Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the
Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are
discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds” and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds,” if the

Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and
except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.


-----

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor or, following an

acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, each creditor and each
Operating Facility Lender irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the
Group’s liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers
reasonably necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent

reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters referred to in this “Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the_
actions contemplated by this “Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the
Security Agent requests that a creditor or an Operating Facility Lender take that action, undertake
that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require,
although a Senior Notes Trustee, a Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee and the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee shall be under no obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security
Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover by the Creditors_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time prior

to the Final Discharge Date, any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender receives or recovers from
any member of the Group:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, (i) any of the liabilities
which is prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or (ii) following the
occurrence of the relevant distress event which is continuing, any Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities_
owed to it which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress
event including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the
Group other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
member of the Group; or


-----

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence
of a distress event,

other than, in each case, (A) any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “Application of Proceeds;” and (B) in the
case of intra-Group liabilities, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement regulating the intra-Group lender and
intra-Group liabilities (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered notwithstanding
that an acceleration event is continuing);

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security in accordance with the provisions set out
below in the caption “Application of Proceeds;” or

(e) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on
account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “Application of Proceeds”
and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect
of that member of the Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will (in the case of any receipts and recoveries referred
to in paragraph (e) above, if a distress event has not occurred, only if required by the Security
Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to certain exceptions: (i) in
relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount
of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and any
other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject
to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent,
promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the
relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by
way of set-off, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from
the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by

(i) an Instructing Group; (ii) if required as set out under the third paragraph of this section, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; or (iii) if required as set out under the fourth paragraph of this
section, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) an

Instructing Group; (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the
security prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date as described


-----

under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Creditors and Permitted Second Lien
_Financing Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors or (iii) to the extent permitted to_
enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Primary Discharge Date as
described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent
_Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving,_
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing

Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in
the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has
not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to
give to the Security Agent as described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Second Lien
_Creditors and Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities” above._

Prior to the Primary Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security

Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from
an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make
a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent
as described under the caption “Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior
_Parent Liabilities” above._

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall have

any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “Enforcement

_Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without_
limitation, the selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be
appointed by the Security Agent) as:

  - an Instructing Group;

  - prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security

Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under the caption “Enforcement of Security”
above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce
the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of
enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or

  - prior to the Primary Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth

paragraph under the caption “Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to
instructions given by the Majority Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii)
an Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the
security, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,


-----

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being
understood that, absent such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than any Senior

Notes Trustee, Permitted Second Lien Notes Trustee or Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each
Operating Facility Lender agrees with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal
put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of
any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of
the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the
purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
party can exercise or require any other creditor or Operating Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce, discharge, extend
the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that creditor or
Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the

Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may
otherwise have to require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any
particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being
applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security

Agent, then that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in
accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed
as references to that creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors

acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the
security prior to the Primary Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver
or delegate owed to any Senior Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that security shall be no
different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the
Debtors under general law.

_Consultation Period_

(a) Subject to paragraph (d) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to
enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other


-----

Enforcement Action, the creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented
in the Instructing Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties)
shall consult with each other creditor representative of the Creditors of the Instructing
Group, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender and the Security
Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period
of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case of any consultation involving a Senior
Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a creditor representative in respect of any
high-yield notes, debt securities or other similar instruments, 30 days) from the date on
which details of the proposed instructions are received by such creditor representative(s),
Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter
period as each creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and
the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry
of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security
or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, in the event conflicting instructions are received from any
other Instructing Group, the Security Agent shall enforce the security, refrain or cease from
enforcing the security or, as the case may be, take the relevant other Enforcement Action
in accordance with the instructions given by an Instructing Group referred to in paragraph
(a)(i)(A) of the definition of Instructing Group as set out above (in each case, provided that
such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents) and the terms of all instructions given by any other
Instructing Group shall be deemed revoked.

(c) Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if:

(i) the Super Senior Secured Creditors have not been fully repaid within six months of
the end of the first Consultation Period;

(ii) the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement of the security (or a
transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the
end of the first Consultation Period; or

(iii) an Insolvency Event has occurred and the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement of the security (or a transaction in lieu thereof) or other Enforcement
Action at that time,

then the Security Agent shall follow the instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
(in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents).

(d) Subject to paragraph (c) above, no Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult
in accordance with paragraph (a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give
any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement
Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each case provided that such


-----

instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the creditors represented in
the Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor
representative, the Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into
such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the
security would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and,

where this paragraph (d) applies:

(I) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the
interests of the Super Senior Secured Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors (as
applicable) on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation
to the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

(II) the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the

relevant Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person
releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is
the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Revolving Facility Agreement, the
Senior Bridge Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted
Senior Financing Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement,
any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement
(each a “Debt Financing Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the
Group, but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Group in a
Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a
member of the Group;


-----

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or
agreement in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in
respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligations or take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the
extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any
member of the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor or will cease to be a Debtor
simultaneously with such release; and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding

company of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding
company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in
connection with the resignation of that Debtor or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request
and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that
Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the security and the
Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “Non-Distressed Disposals”

section, the Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(a) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, the relevant
disposal or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement;
or

(b) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (d) above, the relevant release is
in accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements;

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the
Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but

without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into such
documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give
effect to any release or other matter described in the paragraph above.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Revolving Finance

Documents or the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other
transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Super Senior
Liabilities or Senior Liabilities (as applicable) then no such application of those proceeds shall
require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Notes Finance
Documents or Permitted Parent Financing Documents and any such application shall discharge in


-----

full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any
member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment,
redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent
permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the

request and at the cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group

which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security
interest has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s),
(b) being effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant
security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third-party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the

Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating
Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor):

(a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion
of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing
liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-Group lender, or another Debtor over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;


-----

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company
of a Debtor, to release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any
part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that
holding company over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-Group lender or another Debtor over that
holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities
owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding
company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the
“Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities; provided
that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee
shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to dispose of:

(A) all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(B) all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving
**Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any**
subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-Group liabilities or the Debtor
liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:


-----

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-Group
liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-Group lenders and
Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which
owe those obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also
a guarantor of Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer
of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor
liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-Group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of
liabilities or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds” (to
the extent that the asset disposed of constituted secured assets) as if those proceeds were
the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any
disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent

(acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent
shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in
order to achieve a higher price).

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in relation to a

member of the Group would otherwise be released pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities transferred
to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally
possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party
or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal

effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition
to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially
all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a “public auction” in respect of which
the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or, in circumstances where the Security Agent
(acting in good faith) considers that a public auction is not reasonably practicable taking into
account all relevant circumstances or following an attempted public auction the Primary Creditors
(other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors and the Senior Parent Creditors) make
the highest final binding offer of all the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par
value of the Primary Liabilities (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and
the Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent financial adviser has delivered an opinion in respect


-----

of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement,
provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in
respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or
secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is

being effected such that, generally, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities will be
released or disposed of or any security securing the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities
will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

  - each Permitted Second Lien Creditor Representative has approved the release; or

  - where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of the Permitted Second

Lien Financing Liabilities are sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(b) all claims of the Super Senior Secured Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the
Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or
similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares
(other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) or assets are
sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally
released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are
not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security interests under
the security documents in respect of the shares or assets that are sold or disposed of
is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with
such sale; provided that, if each of the Revolving Agent, Senior Bridge Agent, any
Senior Notes Trustee and any relevant senior secured creditor representative (acting
reasonably and in good faith):

(i) determines that the Super Senior Secured Creditors or the Senior Secured
Creditors (as applicable) will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold
or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not
released or discharged; and

(ii) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(c) such sale or disposal is made:

entitled to participate; or


-----

(ii) in circumstances where the Security Agent (acting in good faith) considers
that a public auction is not reasonably practicable taking into account all
relevant circumstances or following an attempted public auction the
Primary Creditors (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Creditors and the Senior Parent Creditors) make the highest final binding
offer of all the offers received but that offer is less than the aggregate par
value of the Primary Liabilities (other than the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities and the Senior Parent Liabilities), an independent
financial adviser has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal,
that the amount received in connection therewith, generally, is fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances,

financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/ or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Senior Parent Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such

that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt or any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior
Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and any Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities will be released or disposed of, it is a further condition to the release
that either:

  - the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has

approved the release; or

  - where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer

are sold:

(a) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(b) all claims of the Super Senior Secured Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or
guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of

connection therewith, generally, is fair from a financial point of view taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be
limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being

in the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of
the security interests or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of
priority contemplated in the section captioned “Application of ProceedsOrder of
_Application”), the relevant Senior Secured Creditors will make such payments among_

(c) if, for any reason, any Super Senior Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities remain

Lenders at the relevant enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security interests or a transaction in lieu
thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned
“Application of ProceedsOrder of Application”), the relevant Super Senior Secured
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments among themselves
as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Super Senior Secured Creditors and
the Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after taking into account such
payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise
reflect the order of priority contemplated in the section captioned “Application of
_ProceedsOrder of Application”)._

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a

security document may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

_PriorityAdditional and/or Refinancing Debt” above) or “non-Distressed Disposal” (see_
“Proceeds of DisposalsNon-Distressed Disposals”) or any other provision of the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement or in connection with any other provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided
that such amendment or waiver is not expressly prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt
Document) shall be binding on all parties to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and

the Security Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects or omissions, resolve
ambiguities or inconsistencies or reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, or
as otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured Parties.

Any amendment, waiver or consent which relates only to the rights or obligations

applicable to creditors under a particular Debt Financing Agreement (and which does not

that Debt Financing Agreement and the Parent.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to the paragraph below and to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement

and unless the provisions of any debt document expressly provide otherwise, the Security Agent
may, if authorized by an Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive
any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be
binding on each party.

Subject to the second and third paragraphs of the section captioned “Exceptions,” any

amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document which would adversely affect
the nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement
of the security are distributed requires approval as set out under the section captioned “Required
_Consents.”_

**_Guarantees_**

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties and

Operating Facility Lenders (each as defined above) to receive guarantees and indemnities from the
Debtors on substantially the same terms (including the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and
indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the Revolving Facility
Agreement.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the following paragraphs of this “Exceptions” section, an amendment, waiver

or consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an agent, an arranger or
the Security Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that
agent, that arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The foregoing shall not apply:

  - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or


-----

  - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the
caption “Proceeds of Disposals” above.

The first paragraph of this “Exceptions” section shall apply to an arranger only to the

extent that the arranger liabilities are then owed to that arranger.

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor

Agreement overrides anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

**Non-Recourse Facilities**

The Group has two non-recourse committed asset-backed securitization facilities, being

the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility and the Euro Non-Recourse Facility.

**_The Sterling Non-Recourse Facility_**

The Sterling Non-Recourse Facility is a £100 million revolving senior loan note facility

secured against a portfolio of UK unsecured non-performing consumer debt receivables
(“Receivables”) and is governed by an English Law senior loan note issuance agreement which
certain entities within the Target Group entered into on April 30, 2019 (the “Sterling Non**Recourse Facility”). Interest on the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility is payable at a rate equal to**
LIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 3.1% per annum.

The Borrower under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility is AGL Fleetwood Limited, a

special purpose vehicle (the “Sterling Non-Recourse Borrower”).

Borrowing under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility is governed by a borrowing base

mechanism which determines the availability of senior funding and, in simplified terms, is
calculated by taking the 84-Month ERC on a rolling look-forward basis (“Borrowing Base”). The
Borrowing Base is multiplied by an advance rate of 55% and, if on any monthly calculation date
the balance of the senior loan notes exceeds this amount, a borrowing base breach (“Borrowing
**Base Breach”) occurs. A Borrowing Base Breach has a number of adverse consequences including**
acting as a drawstop and, if not cured, an event of default. In addition, under certain circumstances,
where actual collections in respect of the receivables are below 85% of forecast collections this
can result in an early amortization of the facility.

The Sterling Non-Recourse Facility is treated as a “securitization” for the purposes of

Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (the “EU Securitization Regulation”) and as such, Arrow Global
Limited has agreed to certain undertakings in connection with the EU Securitization Regulation
(including an obligation to retain a net economic interest of not less than 5% in the securitization)


-----

pursuant to the terms of the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility which, if breached, will result in an
event of default under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility.

The Sterling Non-Recourse Facility also includes other customary events of default.

The Sterling Non-Recourse Facility originally had a five year term, comprising an initial

two year revolving period, followed by a three year amortization period with an option to extend
by one year, subject to lender consent. The Target Group has sold additional Receivables to the
Sterling Non-Recourse Borrower at various points in time since the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility
Agreement was originally concluded in April 2019.

On July 31, 2019, the Target Group sold a further Receivable with £44 million of ERC into

the Sterling Non-Recourse Borrower and subsequently borrowed an additional £25 million nonrecourse funding on the same terms agreed under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility. On March
31, 2020, the Group sold receivables with £30 million of ERC into the Sterling Non-Recourse
Borrower and on April 2, 2020, borrowed an additional £21 million non-recourse funding on the
same terms agreed under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility.

During July 2020, the Target Group entered into further arrangements in connection with

the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility to mitigate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
collections in respect of the Receivables. Additional Receivables with £33.0 million of ERC were
sold into the structure with no additional borrowings made. In consideration for the additional
Receivables pledged, the lender agreed to amend certain performance criteria. As of June 30, 2021,
the outstanding balance of the senior loan notes under the Sterling Non-Recourse Facility was
£54.7 million.

**_The Euro Non-Recourse Facility_**

The Euro-Non Recourse Facility is an asset backed term senior loan note facility that has

been used to acquire certain Portuguese portfolio investments including certain unrated notes, nonperforming loans previously acquired by Arrow Global Limited and an intercompany loan used to
acquire shares in certain REOcos (being special purpose vehicles that own real estate that has been
foreclosed on) (the “Euro Non-Recourse Portfolio”). The Euro Non-Recourse Facility was
entered into on June 30 2021 and is amortizing on each quarterly payment date according to an
amortization schedule. The tenor of the Euro Non-Recourse Facility is three years with an option
to extend by a further year.

The Borrower under the Euro Non-Recourse Facility is AGL Fleetwood 2 Limited, a

special purpose vehicle (the “Sterling Non-Recourse Borrower”).

Interest on the Euro Non-Recourse Facility is payable at EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus

a margin of 4.25% per annum (rising to 6% per annum if the tenor is extended beyond three years).

If during any monthly collection period, gross collections in respect of the Euro Non
Recourse Portfolio is less than 90% of forecasted gross collections, a termination event
(“Termination Event”) occurs which, if not cured, leads to an event of default under the Euro
Non-Recourse Facility.


-----

The Euro Non-Recourse Facility is treated as a “securitization” for the purposes of the EU

Securitization Regulation and as such, Arrow Global Limited has agreed to certain undertakings
in connection with the EU Securitization Regulation (including an obligation to retain a net
economic interest of not less than 5% in the securitization) pursuant to the terms of the Euro NonRecourse Facility which, if breached, will result in an event of default under the Euro NonRecourse Facility.

The Euro Non-Recourse Facility also includes other customary events of default.

As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Euro Non-Recourse Facility

was €48.0 million.

**_Collateral_**

As of June 30, 2021, the Non-Recourse Facilities had £284.1 million of portfolio

investments pledged as collateral.

**_Governing law_**

The Non-Recourse Facilities are governed by English law.

**Miscellaneous Facilities**

The Group has various miscellaneous debt factoring and uncommitted overdraft facilities

provided by certain financial institutions in relation to the Target Group’s cash management and
other administrative requirements in the territories in which the Target Group operates. The
Group’s Miscellaneous Facilities comprise of account receivables purchase agreements, factoring
agreements (on a non-recourse basis), supplier agreements and other miscellaneous facilities. The
Miscellaneous Facilities are non-recourse facilities. The Miscellaneous Facilities will remain
outstanding as of the Issue Date. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding balance under the
Miscellaneous Facilities was £3.1 million.

-----

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such

Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder

thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

**_Euro Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against

the principal outstanding on the Euro Floating Rate Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor), plus    %, as determined by the calculation
agent (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Global Loan Agency Services Limited.

Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears

on       ,       ,        and        of each year, commencing on       , 2022, to
Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on the Euro Floating Rate
Notes will accrue from the Issue date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Euro Floating Rate Notes is not a Business

Day, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any
such delay.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. London time, on each

Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable on the Euro Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest
**Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the**
principal amount of Euro Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest
Period, multiplying such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned
divided by 360.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary,

to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a
percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g. 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to
4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from calculations will be rounded
to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the
Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful
default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the holder of any Euro Floating

Rate Notes, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Euro Floating Rate Notes.
The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Euro Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments


-----

of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days

elapsed. The Applicable Rate on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the
maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the

calculation of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two

TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial
determination date shall be       , 2021.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage

per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on page EURIBOR01 of the Thomson
Reuters screen (or any replacement Thomson Reuters page which displays that rate), as of 11:00
a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. Unless the immediately following paragraph
applies, if such Thomson Reuters page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal office of each of four major banks in the
euro zone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Calculation Agent,
to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro
zone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at
least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer
will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the
Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three month period beginning on
the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If
fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in
effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In no event shall EURIBOR be
less than 0.00%.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, is no longer

generally representative of the underlying market which EURIBOR seeks to represent on the Issue
Date or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro zone for the purposes of determining
floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the rate of interest on the Euro
Floating Rate Notes will thereafter be determined on an alternative basis by reference to any
successor rate (including any generally accepted adjustment spread) generally accepted in the euro
zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated
securities which originally referenced EURIBOR, as identified by the Issuer in good faith;
provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the


-----

good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent financial advisor,
shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and
including any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably
practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders
of the Euro Floating Rate Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) on the Euro Floating
Rate Notes; provided, however, that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph
shall in all cases not be less than 0.00%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to
this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such
alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the holders on the Euro Floating Rate
Notes and (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) the Calculation Agent of the alternative basis for
determining the rate of interest of the Euro Floating Rate Notes in place of EURIBOR, and the
Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate (without further enquiry,
investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) as sufficient evidence thereof.
Holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes shall be bound by any such alternative basis without any
further action or consent by the holders of the Euro Floating Rate Notes or the Trustee. Under the
terms of the Indenture, the Trustee shall be permitted to agree, without consent of the Holders of
the Euro Floating Rate Notes, to make conforming changes to the provisions (as recommended or
put forward by an independent financial adviser) to reflect the mechanics for the determination of
interest under the chosen alternative basis.

“Thomson Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on

Thomson Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page
is available, such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“euro zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that

have adopted the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment

date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest
payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on the Issue Date
and end on and exclude       , 2021.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is

representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the TARGET (Trans-European

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system) is open.

**_Euro Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of    % per annum on the

payable in cash, semi-annually in arrears on        and        of each year, commencing
on       , 2022, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on
the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid
or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate


-----

Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each
interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Euro Fixed Rate Notes is not a Business Day,

the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding

such delay.

**_Sterling Notes_**

Interest on the Sterling Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum on the principal

outstanding on the Sterling Notes. Interest on the Sterling Notes will be payable in cash, semiannually in arrears on        and        of each year, commencing on       , 2022, to
Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on the Sterling Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid,

include) the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Sterling Notes is not a Business Day, the

Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business
Day, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

“Euro Fixed Rate Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Euro Fixed Rate Notes to
be issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes that are Euro Fixed Rate Notes, and
(v) “Sterling Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Sterling Notes to be issued on
the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes that are Sterling Notes. Additional Notes shall be
treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect
to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such
series. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, Additional Notes shall be
deemed to form one series with any Notes previously issued if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such other Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes sold
pursuant to Rule 144A are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common
Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are
distinguishable from such previously issued Notes. Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation
S from time to time may at the option of the Issuer be issued with the same ISIN, Common Code,
CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously
issued without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
**If you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal**
**_Income Tax Considerations”) considering the purchase of Notes sold pursuant to Regulation_**
**S as part of this offering or in the secondary market, you should consult your tax advisors**
**concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase,**
**ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the potential issuance of**
**Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial Notes for U.S.**
**federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are not capable of being separately**
**identified.**

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined under “—

_Additional Amounts”), if any, on the Global Notes (as defined under “—Transfer and Exchange”)_


-----

will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined under
“—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes”); provided that all such payments
with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held
by a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated

securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one
or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Notes may be paid by wire transfer to the Person entitled thereto as shown on the
register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
_for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes

for so long as the Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will be
GLAS Trust Company LLC.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a

transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be GLAS
Trust Company LLC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and the Paying Agent and the Transfer
Agent (as applicable) will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes
on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Calculation Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent

for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent
that the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require,
the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent.
The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without

interest coupons, as follows:

    - Each series of the Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers

pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
**Global Notes”).**

    - The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common

depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.


-----

    - Each series of the Notes sold to persons who are not U.S. persons and are outside the

United States in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the
144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

    - The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with the common

depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to

Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests
through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof
will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes

delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry

Interests in Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear
or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or
transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale
or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing,
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule
144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding

paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it
was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to
which it was transferred.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN,

Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same


-----

series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that
series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer
to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series.
Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our financial profile, the
_Notes and the Guarantees—Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be fungible_
_with existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes,” “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—_
_Transfers” and “—Additional Notes.”_

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum

denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of
£1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture.
It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth
in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent
or the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive

Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations
of £100,000 or €100,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000
in excess thereof, as the case may be. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of
the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection
with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or

exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date applicable to such Notes;

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer (as defined under “—Change of Control”) or an


-----

Asset Disposition Offer (as defined under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_sales of assets and Subsidiary stock”); or_

(5) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next
succeeding interest payment date.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be

entitled to treat the Holder as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

All the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries on the Issue Date, except for our

Jersey fund management group, consisting of (i) AGG Capital Management (Holdco) Limited
(“ACMH”), (ii) AGG Capital Management Limited (“ACML”), which is ACMH’s direct
Subsidiary and our main fund management entity, and (iii) ACML’s Subsidiaries, which include,
among others, general partners of the various funds managed by ACML. Each of the foregoing is
an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In the circumstances described below under the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Parent will be permitted to designate additional Restricted
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of
the restrictive covenants contained in the Indenture.

**Note Guarantees**

On or about the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will be

unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Parent, Finco and Bidco (the “Initial
**Guarantors”). As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than the Backstop Date,**
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes will
be unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Target and certain material wholly
owned Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent (the “Additional Guarantors”).

Each guarantee of the Notes is referred to as a “Note Guarantee;” each Restricted

Subsidiary that provides a guarantee of the Notes (a “Subsidiary Note Guarantee”) is referred to
herein as a “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent as the “Guarantors.” The
Initial Guarantors will include each entity that has guaranteed the Revolving Facilities Agreement
(in addition to the Issuer) as of October 6, 2021.

In addition, after the Issue Date, in accordance with the covenant described under “—

_Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral,” under certain circumstances, the_
Parent will cause a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to become a Guarantor. The new
Guarantor will also, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be required to pledge assets in favor
of the Subsidiary Note Guarantee as described under “—Security.”

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of

obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant
would be restricted by applicable law, general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar
matters. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”


-----

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the

Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions
of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as
otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Note Guarantee provided by the Parent (the “Parent Guarantee”) and the Subsidiary

Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only, a sale or other disposition
(including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor or of a Holding Entity thereof, such that such Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the relevant Guarantor (other than to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), in
each case in a transaction otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only, the designation in accordance with
the Indenture of the relevant Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and discharge;”_

(4) in the case of a Subsidiary Note Guarantee only (other than a Subsidiary Note
Guarantee issued on or about the Issue Date) to the extent that the relevant
Guarantor becomes a Guarantor solely due to the operation of the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Additional Note
_Guarantees and Collateral,” upon the release of the relevant guarantee or discharge_
of Indebtedness referred to in such paragraph;

(5) in the case of any Note Guarantee given by any parent of the IPO Pushdown Entity,
pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown;”

(6) upon full payment of all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Indenture and the Notes; or

(7) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain
of our secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations

SPVs, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued
by those Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs, and claims of preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase Obligations SPVs will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and Permitted Purchase


-----

Obligations SPVs over the claims of creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors, including Holders.
The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of any current and
future Subsidiaries of the Parent that do not become Guarantors and any Permitted Purchase
Obligations SPVs.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

No later than the Issue Date, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles,

certain perfection requirements, the applicable Transaction Security Documents and the grant of
further Permitted Collateral Liens, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by certain
security granted in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes
the Trustee on behalf of the Holders), including:

(a) a limited recourse English law share charge over all shares by Midco in the Parent
and security assignment of intercompany loans owed by the Parent to Midco; and

(b) an English law debenture granted by each of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer
over certain material assets of the Parent, Finco, Bidco and the Issuer

(collectively, the “Closing Date Collateral”).

As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case no later than the Backstop Date, subject

to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, the applicable
Transaction Security Documents and the grant of further Permitted Collateral Liens, the Notes and
the Note Guarantees will be secured by certain security granted by the Additional Guarantors in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the secured parties (which includes the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders), including (1) an English law debenture over certain material assets of the
Additional Guarantors that are incorporated in England and Wales, (2) comparable security for
Additional Guarantors incorporated in Guernsey and Jersey, and (3) with respect to the Additional
Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands, security over (i) the material bank accounts of such
Additional Guarantors, (ii) intra-Restricted Group receivables, and (iii) shares owned by such
Additional Guarantors in the Issuer or the other Guarantors (the “Post Closing Date Collateral”
and, together with the Closing Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain guarantees may not be granted, certain assets may

not be secured or such security may not be perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles, including:

    - if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the

Holders and the other secured parties;

    - if providing such security requires consent of a third party and, if the asset is material,

such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors, or if the asset is
subject to trust arrangements or is otherwise managed on behalf of one or more third
parties;


-----

    - if providing such security would be prohibited by applicable law, general statutory

limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization” rules or similar matters or entering into the Transaction Security
Documents would conflict with fiduciary duties of directors, contravene any legal or
regulatory prohibition or result in (or a material risk of) personal or criminal liability
on the part of directors or officers;

    - if the granting of security or perfecting such security would have a material adverse

effect on the ability of such Subsidiary to conduct its operations and business in the
ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

    - if the relevant assets or proposed grantor of a guarantee are located in a jurisdiction

which is not a “Security Jurisdiction,” which jurisdictions consist of England and
Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Netherlands; and

    - in the case of bank accounts, notices to the banks with whom the accounts are

maintained will only be served if required by local laws to perfect the relevant security.

**_Administration and enforcement of security_**

The Transaction Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by a Security

Agent (or, in certain circumstances, a receiver or delegate) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
for the benefit of all the secured parties. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and
jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured
obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions. See also “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our financial profile, the Notes and the
_Guarantees—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather_
_than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the_
_Collateral may be restricted by local law.” The enforcement of the Collateral will be subject to_
the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor
Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of Holders to realize the Collateral will be subject to various insolvency law

limitations in the event of the security provider’s insolvency and various contractual limitations
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors— _Risks relating to our financial profile,_
_the Notes and the Guarantees—English, Guernsey, Jersey and Dutch insolvency laws may provide_
_you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law” and “Risk Factors—_ _Risks relating to our_
_financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses_
_that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The Transaction Security Documents will provide that the rights of the Holders with

respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders will not be a
party to the Transaction Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take
any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Transaction Security Documents.
The Holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security


-----

Agent will agree to release a security interest created by the Transaction Security Documents at
the direction of the Trustee that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, the Holders, in certain circumstances, will share in the ability to
direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the
Transaction Security Documents. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

Subject to the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the Issuer, Midco and the

Guarantors have the right to remain in possession and retain control of the Collateral securing the
Notes (other than as set forth in the Transaction Security Documents), to freely operate the
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Parent in

connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the
sale of the Collateral remaining after the payment of obligations under the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, Hedging Obligations or certain operating facilities (if any) or other super priority
obligations would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders as well as any other
obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all the Collateral will be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to
_our financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will be secured only to the extent_
_of the value of the Collateral that will have been granted as security for the Notes and the_
_Guarantees, and such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and_
_the Guarantees.”_

By accepting a Note, each Holder, will be deemed to have:

    - irrevocably appointed GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as Security Agent, in each

case to act as its security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant
documents to which the security agent is a party (including, without limitation, the
Transaction Security Documents);

    - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the

rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor
Agreement or other documents to which the Security Agent is a party, together with
any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document
expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

    - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and each Holder will also be deemed to
have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the terms of the Transaction Security Documents themselves may provide for

assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without the need for a formal
release (such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge) or the exclusion of certain assets


-----

from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example, assets that
may not be validly pledged or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien).

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent shall release, and, if so requested, the Trustee shall direct the Security

Agent to release, without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes
issued under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof;

(2) upon release of a Note Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such Note
Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral to any Person; provided that if the
Collateral is disposed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, the relevant
Collateral becomes immediately subject to a substantially equivalent Lien in favor
of the Security Agent securing the Notes (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer and the Parent”);
_provided, further, that, in each case, such disposition is permitted by the Indenture;_

(4) if the Parent designates any Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors under certain
of our secured Indebtedness as provided under the Intercreditor Agreement, or
otherwise in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—
_Impairment of security interest;”_

(7) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture; and

(8) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation.”_

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the

Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee unless otherwise requested.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Parent shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant


-----

Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that: (i) references to the
Parent and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to
the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time,
although the Issuer shall remain the same entity and the shares of the Issuer shall
be subject to a Lien in favor of the “Secured Parties” (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), that is
substantially equivalent to the pledge of the shares of the Issuer entered into in
connection with the Offering; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and
financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown
Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO
Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Parent” shall be
deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and
unless the context requires otherwise); provided that nothing in this paragraph (a),
including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any
action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Parent,
shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of
any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv)
none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of
Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents shall apply to any entity of
which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute
or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or
an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
and any security granted by any such Holding Company (subject to sub-clause (i)
above); and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Parent: (A) each person which is
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
as an “Investor” or an “Intra-Group Lender” shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified
by the Parent that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as
the case may be, and shall have no further rights or obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor
or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be); and (B) there shall be no obligation or
requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the
case may be; and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not
become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, as a


-----

consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes
that any Person be an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, or that
any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise subordinated
shall cease to apply. An IPO Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event
of Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment
to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or
the Transaction Security Documents required by the Parent in writing and/or take
such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate or reflect any of
the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above (the “IPO Pushdown”); provided
that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as appropriate, does not affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the
Security Agent under such amendment, replacement or other document or
instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and
instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such
amended or replacement documents and/or take such other action on behalf of the
Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be the Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent notified to the Trustee by the Parent in
writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO
Event; provided that: (i) the IPO Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will
issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a
Holding Company of such member of the Group); (ii) the Issuer shall become a
Restricted Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity; and (iii) the Parent may not
designate as the IPO Pushdown Entity any entity which is not a direct or indirect
Holding Company of Restricted Subsidiaries constituting all or substantially all of
the Group’s tangible assets.

(d) If the Parent delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a)
above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by
written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in
accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to
(a)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any
security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Transaction Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if
any Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor


-----

Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be, has been
released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above
in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably
practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor or Intra-Group Lender, as the case may be.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise

restrict the Parent from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or
contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be
deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty,
undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or
step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown
Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On or about the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede on behalf of the Holders to the

Intercreditor Agreement among the Issuer, the Parent, the Security Agent and the other parties
thereto. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the Revolving Facilities Agreement, any Hedging Agreements (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and certain operating facilities that are secured by Collateral that also
secures our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, will receive priority with respect
to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. Any remaining
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under the
Revolving Facilities Agreement, Hedging Agreements and certain operating facilities have been
repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be
Incurred and secured by the Collateral.

**_Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Parent, in connection with the

Incurrence or refinancing by the Issuer, the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any
Indebtedness secured or permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer, the Parent, the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall enter into
an intercreditor or similar agreement or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) with the holders of
such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Parent are not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to the application of the proceeds of the collateral held
thereunder and the means of enforcement, it being understood that an increase in the amount of
Indebtedness being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not be deemed to be less favorable to the Holders and will be permitted by this
covenant if the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the “—
_Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens”_


-----

covenants; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. As used
herein, the term “Intercreditor Agreement” shall include references to any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement that supplements or replaces the Intercreditor Agreement acceded to by
the Trustee on the Issue Date.

The Indenture will provide that, at the written direction of the Parent and without the

consent of the Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
any Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any
such agreement, (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such agreement (provided that such
Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture), (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral
to secure Additional Notes Incurred in compliance with the Indenture or to implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (vi) effect the IPO Pushdown or (vii) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Parent shall
not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and waivers” or as
permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Parent may only direct the Trustee
to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture relating to the Notes or any Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have

agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement (whether then
entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
authorized the Trustee to enter into any one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
as contemplated above.

**The Proceeds Loan Agreement**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and Finco, as borrower, will enter

into a proceeds loan agreement (the “Proceeds Loan Agreement”) pursuant to which the Issuer
will loan to Finco the gross proceeds from the issuance of each series of Notes (each, a “Proceeds
**Loan”).**

These Proceeds Loans will be in euro and/or pound sterling in aggregate principal amount

equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds.” The Proceeds Loans will bear
interest at a rate sufficient to pay the interest expense on the Notes. Interest on the Proceeds Loans
will be payable semi-annually (in respect of those Proceeds Loans relating to the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and the Sterling Notes) and quarterly (in respect of those Proceeds Loans relating to the
Euro Floating Rate Notes) in arrears on or prior to the corresponding date for the payment of
interest on the Notes.


-----

All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loans will be payable to such account or accounts

with such Person or Persons as the Issuer may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loans
will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes. Except as otherwise required by law, all
payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made without deductions or withholding
for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that Finco is required to make any such
deduction or withholding, Finco shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer
receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made.

The Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that Finco will make all payments pursuant

thereto on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under
the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on the Notes.

The Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement will be assigned by way of security

to the Security Agent and will comprise part of the Collateral, as described above under “—
_Security—The Collateral.”_

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below.


-----

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, if and for so long

as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Authority so require, inform the Authority of such optional redemption and confirm the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately
after such redemption.

Any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more

conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, the notice of redemption may state that, at the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall
be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than
10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the

related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose
name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest
will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or

otherwise.

**_Sinking fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund

payments with respect to the Notes.

**_Selection and notice_**

If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar

will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities
exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent or the Registrar
by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or if the
Notes are not so listed, or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not
held through Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Euroclear and/or Clearstream prescribes no method
of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool-factor; provided, however, that no Note of
€100,000 or £100,000, as the case may be, or less in aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed
in part. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for selections made
under this paragraph.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such
redemption and, in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior to
the redemption date, email such notice to Holders at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar; provided that, for so long as any Notes are represented by
Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream


-----

(and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph), each of which
shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note

shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of
the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease
the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption, unless the
redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**Redemption for taxation reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Company (as defined herein) may redeem, and a Guarantor may

cause the Issuer or Successor Company to redeem, the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its
discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders
(which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed
for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (see “—Additional Amounts”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines that as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—
_Additional Amounts”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the application, administration or interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including pursuant to a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of
the Notes or any Note Guarantee would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts or increased
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and, in the case of a
payment by a Guarantor, having the Issuer or another Guarantor make the payment, but not
including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of
redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date on which the applicable Notes are issued, such Change in
Tax Law must become effective on or after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued. In
the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that


-----

becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date on which the applicable Notes are issued,
such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of a Successor Company, on or after the date of
assumption by the Successor Company of the Issuer’s obligations hereunder). Notice of
redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and notice.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than

90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer, Successor Company or Guarantor
will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right
so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Company
or Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely upon such Officer’s Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above,
without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a Successor Company under or with

respect to the Notes, or any Guarantor (each of the Issuer, Successor Company and Guarantor, a
“Payor”) with respect to any Note Guarantee, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority
thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, Successor Company, Guarantor or
their agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes, resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee,
including payments of principal, purchase or redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional


-----

**Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments**
by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including
any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the
amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note
Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor
of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company
or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,
being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or the existence of a
business, a permanent establishment, a dependent agent, a place of business or a
place of management present or deemed present in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or Note Guarantee, the enforcement
of rights under a Note or Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payment in respect
thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, withheld or deducted by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or the beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to
provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim
or satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, required by applicable law, regulation, treaty
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from or reduction in the rate of all or part of such Tax; provided in each
case the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a
payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or
similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed in
connection with Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations
thereunder (“FATCA”), any intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and any other jurisdiction implementing or relating to FATCA or any nonU.S. law, regulation or guidance enacted or issued with respect thereto;

(6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note
for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30


-----

days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder
(except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been
imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day
period);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary
or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment
or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a
member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment or Note would
not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note;

(8) any Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted under the Dutch Withholding Tax Act
2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021); or

(9) any combination of the above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full

amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable
law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing
such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and if so obtained by the Payor will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee. If so obtained, such copies shall be made available to the Holders
upon request. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount
of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection with payments in
respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding
Taxes paid per £1,000 or €1,000 principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or

with respect to any payment made on any Note or Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the
date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and Paying Agent an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and
such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to
Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises,
or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment
date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate without further inquiry, as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there

are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or Note Guarantees,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other

excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration on issue or enforcement of any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Proceeds
Loan Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding any such Taxes, charges
or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.

The foregoing obligations of this “Additional Amounts” section will survive any

termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply _mutatis mutandis to any_
jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right

to require the Issuer to repurchase all (equal to £100,000 or €100,000 aggregate principal amount,
and integral multiples of £1,000 or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be) of such Holder’s
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “Change_
of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to
redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional redemption” or all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as

described under “—Optional redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send
a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, by email or otherwise
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder
has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes
at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of
**Control Payment”);**


-----

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is emailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of
Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the

Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment
in respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the
Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent
the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions
thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly wire

to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee or an authentication agent appointed by the Trustee will promptly
authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes
a new Definitive Registered Note equal in an aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate
principal amount that is at least £100,000 or €100,000 or an integral multiple of £1,000 or €1,000
in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any
Change of Control Offer.


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made

in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the
Change of Control Payment Date will be no earlier than 30 days from the date a notice of such
Change of Control Offer is emailed.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any

other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a
Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that
the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire
the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of

Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of

outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer
and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as
described above, purchases all of the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of the applicable series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to,
but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption
date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
applicable series of then-outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a
Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of the applicable series, as applicable, Notes owned
by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other
offer, as applicable.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of

the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which
the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

A Change of Control will result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Facilities

Agreement. Future debt of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer, may prohibit the


-----

Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of
Control is a default or may require repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise
by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under,
or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of the purchase on the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change

of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s and the Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ then-existing
financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our
_financial profile, the Notes and the Guarantees—We may not be able to obtain the funds required_
_to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly

permit a third party to obtain control of the Parent in a transaction which is a Specified Change of
Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of

the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons.

Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no

precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As
a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to

repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the
Indenture.

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any

Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Parent and any_
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving
pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended
four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the
date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following

Indebtedness:


-----

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any
Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof
and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness then outstanding not exceeding: (i) the greater of (x) £285
million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any

the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture (other than pursuant to this clause (2)); provided that,
if Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated or pari passu to the Notes
or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu
to the Notes or Note Guarantees, as applicable, to the same extent as the
Indebtedness guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,”
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such
Person securing Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, in
each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Parent owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

Subsidiary entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect
to the Transactions;

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness that is Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness
described in this clause (4) (other than Refinancing Indebtedness that is
Incurred in respect of any Notes and any Note Guarantee, which will be
deemed to have been Incurred under clause (4)(a) of this paragraph, or
Permitted Purchase Obligations, which will be deemed to have been
Incurred under clause (4)(e) of this paragraph) or clause (5) of this
paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

-----

(e) Permitted Purchase Obligations;

Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated
or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and
assumption of related liabilities) the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii)
Incurred to provide or refinance all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Parent or
a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in connection with or contemplation of such
acquisition; provided, however, with respect to sub-clauses (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at
the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have been permitted to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to the
relevant acquisition and Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5)
or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is Incurred would not be lower than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

purposes of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative
purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Parent);

Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of
design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or

purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and (C)
any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect of sub-clauses (A) or (B),
in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) then
outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (i) £20 million and (ii) 4% of Total
Assets;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance
obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment,
customs, VAT or other tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments

a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations, indemnities or
guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or for governmental or
regulatory requirements, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or


-----

other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or
obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business, (c) the financing of

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken
together with any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect thereof and
the aggregate principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this
clause (11) then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (i) £80 million and (ii)
27.5% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(12) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness and Guarantees in respect
thereof) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause
(12) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Parent from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its

Equity Contribution, Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an
Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through
the Equity Contribution, issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference
Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of the Parent, in each case, subsequent to the
Issue Date; _provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so_


-----

received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted
Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6), (10) and (14) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
to the extent the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed
shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(12) to the extent the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted
Payment under the first paragraph and/or clauses (1), (6), (10) and (14) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
in reliance thereon; and

(13) Indebtedness under any overdraft, working capital, current account, letter of credit,
local credit line, bilateral financing line, foreign exchange, SWIFT and/or other
similar or equivalent facilities or financial accommodation, or any other facility or
financial accommodation by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that
the maximum aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under this
clause (13) does not exceed the greater of (i) £45 million and (ii) 15% of
Consolidated EBITDA and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any

particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with this covenant:

(i) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the
Parent, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item (or any portion of such item) of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the first
paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant; provided that the Parent may
not reclassify Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date that is Incurred under
clauses (1) and (13) of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(ii) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances
or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall
not be included;

(iii) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as
Incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (7) or (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant
or the first paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances
or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(iv) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the
greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including,


-----

in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(v) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA,” (x) pro forma effect
shall be given to Consolidated EBITDA on the same basis as for calculating the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (y)
Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured on the most recent date on which new
commitments are obtained (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which
new Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of
the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date for which
such internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent are available;

(vi) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference
to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one
such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such Indebtedness;

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as
described under the definition of “Indebtedness;” _provided_ that the amount of
Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the balance sheet liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS; and

(viii) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any

Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a
clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of an Applicable Test Date, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the
Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being refinanced.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or

amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as
Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS itself or a change from IFRS to
a different set of accounting principles, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for
purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any

Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of
such date.


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction

on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date; _provided_ that (a) if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded
if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
pound sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premium
(including tender premium), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in
connection therewith; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is
subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in pound sterling, will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Sterling Equivalent of
such amount plus the Sterling Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable
but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of

Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall
not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.
Subject to the preceding paragraph, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced,
shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or

indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or in respect of the
Parent’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Parent (other than
Disqualified Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such
Capital Stock of the Parent or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary
(and, in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or
distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock other than the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis, measured by value);


-----

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the
Parent or any direct or indirect Holding Entity held by Persons other than the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Parent
(other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled
repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness
(other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year
of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement, (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”) and (c) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,_
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement that is a Permitted Investment (other
than Permitted Investments in connection with Subordinated Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”);

(4) make any payment (other than by capitalization of interest) on or with respect to,
or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value
any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person;

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) to (5) above are referred
to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at the time the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary makes
such Restricted Payment:

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result
immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not permitted to Incur an additional
£1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to
such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments
made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including
Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5)(a) (without duplication of
amounts paid pursuant to any other clause of the second succeeding paragraph),
(6), (10), (11) and (12) of the second succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other
Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed
the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting
period) from the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the


-----

Acquisition Completion Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter
ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which internal
consolidated financial statements of the Parent are available (or, in the case
such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit,
_provided that the amount taken into account pursuant to this clause (i) shall_
not be less than zero);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value of
property or assets or marketable securities, received by the Parent from the
issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other
than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference

under “—Change of Control,” if required, and purchased all Notes validly
tendered pursuant to the offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby,
prior to purchasing, repurchasing, redeeming, defeasing or otherwise
acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) at a purchase

Public Offering of such common stock or common equity interests, in an amount
not to exceed in any fiscal year the greater of (a) 6% of the Net Cash Proceeds
received by the Parent from such Public Offering or contributed to the equity (other
than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or
through Excluded Amounts, the Equity Contribution or an Excluded Contribution)
of the Parent or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the
Parent, and (b) following the Initial Public Offering, 7% of the Market

result from) (a) Restricted Payments (including loans or advances) in an aggregate
amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the greater of £35 million or 12.5%
of Consolidated EBITDA, and (b) any Restricted Payment, _provided_ that the

Payment consisting of an Investment or the repayment, redemption or repurchase
of Subordinated Indebtedness, Consolidated Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 3.25 to 1.0);
_provided that if an Investment is made pursuant to this clause (11) in a Person that_
is not a Restricted Subsidiary and such Person subsequently becomes or is
subsequently designated a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, such Investment shall thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant
to clauses (1) or (2) of the definition of “Permitted Investment” and not this clause
(11);

(12) payments by the Parent, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any
Holding Entity to make payments to holders of Capital Stock of the Parent or any
Holding Entity in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such Capital Stock;
_provided, however, that any such payment, loan, advance, dividend or distribution_
shall not be for the purpose of evading any limitation of this covenant or otherwise
to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders of such Capital
Stock (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Parent);

(13) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed
the fair market value of Excluded Contributions, or consisting of non-cash
Excluded Contributions, or Investments to the extent made in exchange for or using
as consideration Investments previously made under this clause (13); provided that,
the amount of Excluded Contributions shall not include any amount that is also an
Equity Contribution;

(14) (i) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of
Designated Preference Shares of the Parent issued after the Issue Date; and (ii) the
declaration and payment of dividends to any Holding Entity or any Affiliate thereof,
the proceeds of which will be used to fund the payment of dividends to holders of
any class or series of Designated Preference Shares of such Holding Entity or


-----

Affiliate issued after the Issue Date; provided, however, that, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii), the amount of all dividends declared or paid pursuant to this
clause (14) shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Parent or the
aggregate amount contributed in cash to the equity (other than the Equity
Contribution or through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Excluded Amounts or
an Excluded Contribution or, in the case of Designated Preference Shares by a
Holding Entity or an Affiliate the issuance of Designated Preference Shares) of the
Parent or loaned or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the Parent,
from the issuance or sale of such Designated Preference Shares; and

(15) dividends or other distributions of Capital Stock, Indebtedness or other securities
of Unrestricted Subsidiaries (other than securities of ACMH, ACML or any of
ACML’s Subsidiaries (collectively, the “ACMH Group”)).

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on

the date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount. Any
amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the
calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of
clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts
result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received
in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of
Control pursuant to the definition thereof were it not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the
purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable
securities was to reduce the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that
would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets
or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such event
in accordance with the requirements of the indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,

create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such
Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute
Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured (provided that a Lien to secure Indebtedness pursuant to clauses (1) to
(6) (inclusive) of such second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” may have priority not materially less favorable to the Holders than that accorded to_
the Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement), and (b) in the case of any property or assets that
constitute Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.


-----

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (a)(2) of the preceding

paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “Security—
_Release of Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such

Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted
to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any
Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any
accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the
value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group to,

create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital
Stock to the Parent or the Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed
to the Parent or the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Parent or the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or the Issuer;

_provided_ that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y)
the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances
made to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group to other agreement or
instrument entered into by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (or any guarantee
or security granted in connection therewith), including the Revolving Facilities
Agreement, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Collateral or the
Proceeds Loan Agreement, (c) the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents or (d) any other
agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, including, in
each case, any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings, _provided_ that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or
refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to


-----

such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those
agreements referred to in sub-clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, as applicable (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person
or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or
before the date on which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or the
ACMH Group, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or
the ACMH Group in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital
Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion
of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or part of the ACMH
Group or was acquired by the Parent or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group
entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor_
Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any
such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an
agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement
or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); _provided, however, that the encumbrances and_
restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material
respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing
or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent) or that the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred
that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material
respect, the Parent’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes
and/or the Proceeds Loans;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer
of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract,
or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;


-----

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements
permitted under the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group permitted under the Indenture
to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other
security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property
interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary or the ACMH Group;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and
Capitalized Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that
impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or any
encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or the
ACMH Group (or any of its property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement
entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or
substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary or the
ACMH Group (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending
the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements, and other similar
agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with industry practices;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any
applicable rule, regulation or order (including encumbrances or restrictions on
making distributions in cash or Cash Equivalents as a dividend or otherwise that
arise or exist by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or
order), the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit, or
encumbrances or restrictions required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers, suppliers or landlords, or required by insurance, surety or bonding
companies, in each case, under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Agreements or Permitted
Purchased Obligations;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument,
including any encumbrance or restriction relating to any Indebtedness permitted to
be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not


-----

materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Indenture, together with the security documents associated
therewith or (ii) in comparable agreements or instruments (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent) and where, in the case
of clause (ii), the Parent determines, at the time such agreement or instrument is
entered into, that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the
Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted by the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens;” or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction on assets held in trust for a third party, including
pursuant to the relevant trust agreement.

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any

Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility
for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value
(such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Parent, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted
Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the
extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the
consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments.

Within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt

of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash at the option of the
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) (1) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Secured Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) and (13) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof); provided, however, that in connection with any
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this
sub-clause (1) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness, including but not


-----

limited to the Revolving Facilities Agreement), the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment to
be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid,
repaid, purchased or redeemed; _provided, further,_ that in the case of the
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Senior Secured Indebtedness
other than the Revolving Facilities, the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem the Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Senior Secured Indebtedness;
(2) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to
the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (3) in the case of an Asset Disposition
that does not constitute Collateral, to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (I) Pari
Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption, (ii) through repurchase of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness in the open market or (iii) pursuant to the contractual optional
redemption provisions applicable thereto or (II) Senior Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) (i) at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption,
(ii) through repurchase of such Senior Indebtedness in the open market or (iii)
pursuant to the contractual optional redemption provisions applicable thereto;
_provided that in the case of the prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of_
Pari Passu Indebtedness or Senior Indebtedness (in each case, other than the Notes)
pursuant to sub-clause (3), the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem the
Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Indebtedness;

(b) to the extent the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit
to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
_however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a_
definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Parent that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy
this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of
such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a
commitment approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent;
_provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made that is executed or_
approved within such time will only satisfy this requirement so long as such
investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;

(d) to make Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clause (11)(b) of the third paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payment” with the Net
Available Cash from Asset Dispositions, provided that the Consolidated Leverage


-----

Ratio specified in such paragraph shall be calculated on a basis pro forma for the
relevant Asset Disposition and the application of the proceeds thereof; or

(e) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by
the Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or

invested or committed to be applied or invested, or offered to be applied or invested, as provided
in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the difference will be deemed to constitute “Excess
**Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net**
Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment
approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the
second paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B)
the receipt of such Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the
Parent elects, if the aggregate amount of “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture exceeds the
greater of £10 million and 2.5% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent will be required to make an
offer (or procure an offer is made) (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued
under the Indenture and, to the extent the Parent so elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari
Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such
Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out
of the “Excess Proceeds,” at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in
the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal
amount of such Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each
case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so

validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than
the “Excess Proceeds,” the Parent may use any remaining “Excess Proceeds” for general
corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
“Excess Proceeds,” the “Excess Proceeds” shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other
method as (i) the Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, after consultation with the Parent, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as
complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of
calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in pound
sterling or euro, as the case may be based on the denomination of the applicable Notes, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their
Sterling Equivalent or Euro Equivalent, as the case may be, determined as of a date selected by


-----

the Parent that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined herein). Upon completion
of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of “Excess Proceeds” shall be reset at zero.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be

allocated between the various series of Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate principal
amounts of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is

denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated that is actually received upon converting
such portion of Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a

period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition
**Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition**
Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Parent will purchase (or procure the
purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it so elects, any Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer
**Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all**
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Parent will, to the extent lawful,

accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of
the Notes, in minimum denominations of £100,000 or €100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000
or €1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. The Parent will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment in accordance
with the terms of this covenant. The Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer
Period) mail or deliver (or procure the mail or delivery) to each tendering Holder an amount equal
to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder,
and accepted for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global
Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will (via an
authenticating agent) authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry)
such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion
of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount
with a minimum denomination of £100,000 or €100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 or
€1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed
or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Parent or the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be

deemed to be cash:


-----

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Parent or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from all
liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of
such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary
as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Parent and each other
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after
the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £25 million
and 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Parent will comply (or procure compliance), to the extent applicable, with the

requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant,
the Parent will comply (or procure compliance) with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any
conflict.

**_Maintenance of listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing

of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding;
_provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Issuer_
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain and thereafter use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of such Notes on another stock exchange deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer.


-----

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or

indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate
of the Parent (such transaction or series of related transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”)
involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of £10 million and 2.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction
or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the
greater of £30 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such
transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Parent resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than
pursuant to sub-clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment,
consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding Entity, restricted stock plans,
long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or
similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the
Parent, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and
any transaction pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme,
deferred compensation or similar arrangement (including any MEP Payment);

(4) any transaction between or among the Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary (or
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction);


-----

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit
and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or
employees of the Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Holding Entity (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any
of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of,
and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or
instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or
to the extent not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders taken as a whole
in the good faith judgment of an Officer of the Parent and the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with
any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement (including
any transactions which are entered into with any Holding Entity or Unrestricted
Subsidiary in order to satisfy the obligations arising under any Tax Sharing
Agreement) and the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax,
accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of
business;

(8) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent
right or obligation) in relation to any Associate or transactions with customers,
clients, landlords, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, which, in
each case, are either fair to the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent or
any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent or an Associate or similar
entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Parent or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Parent or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such
Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate
and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved
by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent
in their reasonable determination, (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other


-----

provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable and (c) directors’ qualifying shares and
shares issued to foreign nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) below, (a)
payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Holding Entity) of annual
management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of £4 million and 2% of Consolidated
EBITDA in each twelve month period commencing on the Acquisition Completion
Date, and (b) customary payments by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to
any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any
Holding Entity) for financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or
placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including
in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this
sub-clause (b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Parent in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred
by such Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the
Parent and its Subsidiaries; and

(13) any transaction as to which the Parent delivers to the Trustee a written opinion from
an Independent Financial Advisor stating that the transaction (a) is fair to the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries from a financial point of view, or (b) meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the

following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date,
150 days) after the end of the Parent’s fiscal year, beginning with the first fiscal
year ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable,
the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Parent as
of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent for the two most recent fiscal
years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of
the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Parent (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement
or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (and which
have not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Parent);
(c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including


-----

a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital
resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate transactions and
a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt
instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent
developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year
of the Parent (or, in the case of the third fiscal quarter in 2021, 90 days), all quarterly
reports of the Parent containing the following information: (a) an unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recently
completed fiscal quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed
footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Parent (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent
not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the relevant fiscal quarter (and which have not already been the subject
of pro forma information provided by the Parent); (c) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition and material changes in liquidity and capital
resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary
course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition, restructuring,
merger or similar transaction, or any senior executive officer changes at the Parent
or change in auditors of the Parent or any other material event that the Parent
announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect

on the date of such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented;
_provided, however, that in the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, in the event of a_
change in applicable IFRS, earlier periods may be presented on a basis that applied to such periods.
Except as provided for below, no report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Parent. At the Parent’s election it may also include financial statements of the
Target or a Holding Entity in lieu of those of the Parent; provided that, if the financial statements
of the Target or a Holding Entity are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of
material differences between the financial statements of the Target or the Holding Entity, as the
case may be, and the Parent shall be included for any period after the Issue Date. Following an
Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such Capital Stock
on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be
considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of
such stock exchange.


-----

At any time that any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such

Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent, then the annual and quarterly financial
information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include
either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited
financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted
Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial
information of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following
items: revenue, finance costs, profit/loss for the period, cash and cash equivalents, total assets,
total liabilities, equity and capital expenditures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as the
results of ACMH and its Subsidiaries are consolidated within the financial results of the Parent,
and the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are directly or indirectly entitled to all or substantially
all of the distributable profits of ACMH and its Subsidiaries, through ownership of preferred
ordinary shares or otherwise, the reporting requirements relating to Unrestricted Subsidiaries set
out in this paragraph shall not apply with respect to ACMH and its Subsidiaries.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clause

(1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent shall also (a) use its commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such password protected website as may be
then maintained by the Parent and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially
comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Parent in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Board of Directors or an Officer of the
Parent determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described
in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable
efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the
Notes.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3)

of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, at the registered office
of the Issuer.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which

the Parent is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant
to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Parent shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section

is for information purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under
the Indenture.


-----

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer and the Parent_

Neither the Issuer nor the Parent will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey,

transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless (and subject to the other
terms of the Indenture):

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) (if not
the Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will be a Person organized and existing under
the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction and the Successor Company (if not the
Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) will expressly assume (subject in each case to
any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles), (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Parent or the Issuer, as
applicable, under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) to the extent required by
applicable law to effect such assumption, all obligations of the Parent or the Issuer,
as applicable, under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the
Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor
Company would be permitted to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which
such transaction is consummated would not be lower than it was immediately prior
to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Parent shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) complies
with the Indenture, and that all conditions precedent provided for therein relating
to such transaction have been complied with or satisfied, and that the assumption
(if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Successor Company. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary

(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and


-----

any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other

disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the
Parent, which properties and assets, if held by the Parent instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Parent, as the case may be.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every

right and power of, the Parent under the Indenture and the Notes but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under
the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3), the second paragraph of this covenant

and the provisions described below under “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to
transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent
and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine
with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred
to in this sentence), the Parent may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent,
reincorporating the Parent in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Parent.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable

law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph

of this covenant) will not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the
Parent has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on sales of assets and
_Subsidiary stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor may (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose guarantee is to be

released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement):

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to
any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Subsidiary Guarantor,


-----

unless

(A) the other Person is the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case, subject to
any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and, to the extent
required by applicable law to effect such assumption, the obligations under
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Transaction Security Documents to which it is a party, in each case,
subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles;
and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the
Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B) and the provisions described under “—The

_Issuer and the Parent” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any_
Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part
of its properties and assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) if there is more than one Subsidiary
Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of their respective properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as
the case may be. Notwithstanding the preceding sub-clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the
transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating such Subsidiary Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable

law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status

and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from_
_Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Limitation on sales of assets_
_and Subsidiary stock,” “—Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral” and the provisions of_
clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and consolidation—


-----

_The Issuer and the Parent,” (together, the “Suspended Covenants”) and, in each case, any related_
default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply
according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect.
Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since
the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason
of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the
Parent’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of
such covenant, to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of
the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event
and outstanding on the Reversion Date. To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted
to be Incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so_
that it is classified as permitted under sub-clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the

Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension
Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A)
through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on restrictions on
_distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the continuance of the_
Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to sub-clause (1)(c) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

The Parent shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been

satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the Suspended
Covenants. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of any Suspension Event or
Reversion Date.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants shall be reinstated on and from the

Reversion Date, no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under
the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each case, as a result of a
failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the Suspension Event
(or, upon termination of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action taken
or event that occurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion
Date, the Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or
Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or


-----

obligations arising during the continuance of any Suspension Event to the extent that such
contractual commitments or obligations are permitted or not prohibited under the Indenture, and
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**_Financial calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the

Indenture in connection with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such
Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Parent, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Parent
elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma
effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such
Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees,
costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the prior

paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for
all purposes; _provided that (1) the Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any_
Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of
redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of
such Applicable Metrics; and (2) save as contemplated in clause (1) above, compliance with any
Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test
Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an

Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or
otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric
(or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been
exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing

Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of
the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied
with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of
Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied
with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be
continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any

Lien is committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is
tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio or any other ratio
based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any
Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries
under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility, bank guarantee facility or bonding facility
and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under the Revolving Facilities, any
guarantee facility or any ancillary facility under the Revolving Facilities Agreement) and, for the


-----

avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a revolving
facility or guarantee facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the

“numerical permission”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower permission”)
and the grower permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission
at any time as a result of an acquisition or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the
numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower
permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or investments and
shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

Subject to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed

action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to
a numerical permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based
permission, unless otherwise elected by the Parent, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or
a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a four
quarter period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(a) at the option of the Parent, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable

Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the
difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period
and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries during
such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to
100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted
amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding
amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(b) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric

during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, any usage
of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the
following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum
amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause
(a) of this paragraph; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when calculating any financial

definition or ratio under the Indenture, the Parent shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of
any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to
or resulting from (1) the Transactions; (2) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture
permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (3) start-up
costs for new businesses or sites and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; and/or (4)
costs or expenses relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and termination, business
interruption, reorganization and other restructuring or cost cutting measures, the rationalization,
re-branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines, assets, sites or businesses, the
consolidation, relocation or closure of sites or administrative locations and other similar items (for
the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure).


-----

**_Additional Note Guarantees and Collateral_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

Intercreditor Agreement, the Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(other than a Permitted Purchase Obligations SPV) that are not Guarantors or the Issuer, directly
or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Revolving Facilities Agreement (or other
Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Public Debt exceeding £20 million in principal
amount, in whole or in part unless, in each case, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor
on the date on which such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture or other appropriate
agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee on the same
terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari
_passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness._

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and

delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.

Following the provision of any additional Guarantees as described above, subject to the

Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (if such security is being granted in respect of the other Indebtedness), any such
Guarantor will provide security over certain of its material assets (excluding any assets of such
Guarantor which are subject to a Permitted Lien at the time of the execution of such supplemental
indenture if providing such security interest would not be permitted by the terms of such Permitted
Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien) to secure its Guarantee on
a first priority basis consistent with the security agreements related to the existing Collateral. Each
additional Guarantee or security will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable
reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Parent will not be obligated to cause such

Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as
the Incurrence of such Guarantee could or the grant of such security would be inconsistent with
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles or if the relevant assets to be subject
to such security are the capital stock or assets of a Permitted Purchase Obligations SPV.

**_Impairment of security interest_**

The Parent and Midco shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take any

action, which action would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect
to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the
confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent and Midco shall not, and shall not


-----

permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Transaction
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens;”
_provided that the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Midco may Incur any Lien over any of the_
Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including
Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any
circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release

of any Lien in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Transaction Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the foregoing, the Transaction Security Documents may be amended, extended,

renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to
the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in
any material respect; _provided, however, that (except where permitted by the Indenture or the_
Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the
benefit of the Security Agent and the holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with
the Indenture) no Transaction Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated
or otherwise modified or released unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Parent delivers to the Security Agent and the
Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security
Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank
which confirms the solvency of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or
release, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to
any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Security Agent, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
the Lien or Liens created under the Transaction Security Document, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise
subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, modification or release and replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured
by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject. In the event that the Parent, its Restricted
Subsidiaries and Midco comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.


-----

**_Further assurances_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Midco

will, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as
the Security Agent may reasonably require (i) for registering any Transaction Security Documents
in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by
such Transaction Security Documents and (ii) if such Transaction Security Documents have
become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject
to such Transaction Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities
and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Midco will
execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the
Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security
Agent may reasonably request.

**_Limitation on Issuer activities and on Trust Management SPVs and amendments to fund_**
**_arrangements_**

_Limitation on Issuer activities_

The Issuer will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, other

than any activity: (a) subject to compliance with the terms of the Indenture, related to the offering,
sale, issuance, servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange, refinancing or retirement
of or investment in the Notes or any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture;
(b) undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and any
other document relating to the Notes or any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under the
Indenture, including without limitation any security documents, or any intercreditor agreement;
(c) related to the establishment and maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence; (d) related to
using amounts received by the Issuer for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture;
or (e) related to the foregoing. The Issuer will not issue any Capital Stock (other than to the Parent
or a Restricted Subsidiary) or undertake any transaction that will require the Issuer to register as
an “investment company” or an entity “controlled by an investment company” as defined in the
U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

_Limitation on Trust Management SPVs_

No Trust Management SPV will: (a) engage in any business activity or undertake any other

activity, other than such activities (i) necessary or ancillary to managing Trust Management Assets
including as necessary to fulfill any obligations or duties of the Trust Management SPV as a trustee
and including as specifically contemplated hereby including the disposition of any Trust
Management Assets, Incurrence of Indebtedness where the proceeds of such Indebtedness are used
to finance the purchase of Trust Management Assets and granting liens on Trust Management
Assets or (ii) related to the establishment and maintenance of the Trust Management SPV; (b)
issue any Capital Stock other than to the Parent or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (c) incur any
Indebtedness other than Indebtedness without recourse to the Parent or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or any of their assets; (d) hold any assets other than Trust Management Assets and any
other assets necessary or ancillary to managing such Trust Management Assets; (e) establish any


-----

subsidiaries or own Capital Stock of any entity for any purpose; or (f) undertake any transaction
that will require the Issuer to register as an “investment company” or an entity “controlled by an
investment company” as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

_Limitation on amendments to fund compensation agreements_

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or

indirectly, amend any ACO 1 Compensation Arrangement unless (i) the terms of such amendment
(or the ACO 1 Compensation Arrangement as so amended) taken as a whole are in the good faith
determination of an Officer of the Parent fair to the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and (ii)
in the event such amendment involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of £30 million
and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such amendment have been approved by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Parent resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (i) above.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note
issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the
Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any of the Issuer’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Change of Control” above or the obligations of the Parent and
the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants described under “—Certain
_covenants” above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will_
constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days
after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at
least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the Issuer’s
or the Guarantors’ other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of
which is Guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than
Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which
default:


-----

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such
Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided
in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the
“cross acceleration provision”);

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness,
together with the aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under
which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates £30 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the
Parent, Midco, or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer, the Parent, a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £30 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged
liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60
days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(8) any security interest under the Transaction Security Documents on any material
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of £30 million shall, at any time,
cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
such Transaction Security Document or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable in a final non-appealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or the Issuer shall assert in writing that
any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”); and

(9) any Note Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), or a Guarantor
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee in writing, other than
in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of the Note Guarantee in
accordance with the Indenture.


-----

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an

Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes notify the Parent of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and
(7), the Parent does not cure such default (or arranges for such default to be cured) within the time
specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs

and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Parent, or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Parent and the Trustee, may,
and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) of this
“Events of Default” section has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of
principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal

of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all
the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act
on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under

the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
(i) nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any and (ii) a covenant
or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, each of which may
only be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event

of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Indenture or the Notes unless:


-----

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default
is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of
the offer of security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is
inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of

the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person
would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or
security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused
by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible

officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice
of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Parent. The Parent will be
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or, in the case of the first fiscal year ending
after the Issue Date, 150 days) after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate signed by an authorized
representative of the Parent indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Parent will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30
days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute a Default or an Event of Default, their status and what action the Parent is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain

circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of
prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in
relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.


-----

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as will be provided in the

Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as will be provided in
such Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or

otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided that
if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, waive or modify one or more
series of the Notes, at the election of the Parent only the consent of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of each such series (and not the consent of at least a majority
of all Notes then outstanding) shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and (9), 75%) of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Notes (or if such amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend,
waive or modify one or more series of the Notes, at the election of the Parent, the same percentage
of the relevant one or more series of Notes), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any
such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the
time at which any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above
under “—Optional redemption” or “—Redemption for taxation reasons;”

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of
principal or interest on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Additional
_Amounts” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any_
material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a
loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Guarantors from their obligations under their
respective Note Guarantees or the Indenture, except otherwise in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the material
Collateral, other than pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Security Document
or the Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to
a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the
Holders’ consent holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) and (9),
75%) of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Parent, the Issuer,

the Guarantors, the Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement
any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision
of the Note Documents to the “Description of the Notes” contained in an Offering
Memorandum (to the extent such amendment or supplement is in respect of Note
Documents for a new series of Notes without affecting the Note Documents for
Notes already in issue), or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or
the Guarantors under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are
described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code) or change the minimum
denominations for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, the Parent or any

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or

any Holder in any material respect;


-----

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Parent) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance
with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees and_
_Collateral” to add Note Guarantees, add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Transaction Security
Documents) or any amendment in respect thereon with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Transaction Security Documents;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a
successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee to any Note Document; or

to the Revolving Facilities Agreement in any property which is required by the
Revolving Facilities Agreement (in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to
be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security
interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—
_Certain covenants—Impairment of security interest” is complied with._

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such

evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular

form of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to

the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
amendment, supplement and waiver.

For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of the Notes under these

provisions, the principal amount of any Notes not denominated in pound sterling shall be translated
into the Sterling Equivalent amount as of a determination date to be established by the Issuer in
connection with any amendment, consent, waiver or modification sought hereunder.


-----

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes

have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer, the Parent or
any Subsidiary or Holding Company of the Parent will be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding (save as provided in the ninth paragraph of the provisions described under “—Change
_of Control”)._

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, Midco’s and each Guarantor’s obligations

under the Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and
Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust,
the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if
the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Transaction Security Documents in effect at
such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its, Midco’s and each Guarantor’s obligations

under the covenants described under “—Certain covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1)
and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The
_Issuer and the Parent” and the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and_
_consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross
default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option

notwithstanding its prior exercise of the covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with
respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described
under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation” and the covenant described under “—
_Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (other than_
with respect to the Issuer and the Parent), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust

(the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed as agent
by the Trustee for this purpose) (i) with respect to the Notes denominated in pound sterling, cash
in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in pound sterling and
UK Government Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes denominated in euro, cash in euro,
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and eurodenominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in such amounts as will be


-----

sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent, for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as
the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee
of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law since the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of
the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may
be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant
defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require
in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor

Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Document will
be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of the Trustee and
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as will be expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the
Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable
at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or
appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to the Notes denominated in
pound sterling, cash in pound sterling, UK Government Obligations or a combination of cash in


-----

pound sterling and UK Government Obligations and (ii) with respect to the Notes denominated in
euro, cash in euro, euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination of cash
in euro and euro-denominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in an amount
sufficient, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent to
pay and discharge the outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness on the Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid
all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent
under the “—Satisfaction and discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on
any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, Midco or the

Parent, any of the Parent’s Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, as such, shall have
any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, Midco or the Guarantors under the Note Documents
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and certain agents**

GLAS Trust Company LLC will be the Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will

provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture is not to be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become

a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted
to engage in other transactions with the Parent, the Issuer and their respective Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and

replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by giving notice to
the Trustee and the Issuer, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2)


-----

that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee that
is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not
less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance

of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,

liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. Each of the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s
Certificate in formulating its opinion or in taking any action (including, without limitation, release
of a Guarantee or Collateral) under the Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate
without need for investigation or verification (including for the avoidance of doubt the receipt
of Opinions of Counsel), except as may otherwise be expressly required under the terms of the
Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if emailed to them at their respective email

addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, if and for
so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any notices with respect to
the Notes. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be
delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this paragraph, for further transmission to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if

published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
_provided that, if notices are emailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later_
of such publication and the day after being so emailed. Any notice or communication emailed to a
Holder shall be emailed to such Person’s email addresses in the register of the Holders and shall
be sufficiently given to such Holder if so emailed within the time prescribed. Failure to email,
cause to be delivered or otherwise transmit a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in
it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
emailed or delivered in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if

any, on the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date
for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the
Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.


-----

**Currency indemnity**

The currency in which any series of Notes hereunder is issued (the “Relevant Currency”)

is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with such series of Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Relevant
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the Relevant Currency amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount
so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is
not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that Relevant Currency amount is less than the Relevant Currency amount expressed to

be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any series of Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event,
the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder or the Trustee
to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate
and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise
to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any
Holder or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in
full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance

with any pound sterling-denominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for
purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency other than pound sterling shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-pound sterling amount
is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Since all the assets of the Issuer, Midco and the Guarantors are held or located outside the

United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, Midco or any
Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the

Indenture and the Notes and the Note Guarantees, the Issuer, Midco and each Guarantor will in


-----

the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of

the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York.

Group Initiative occurred and was fully implemented on the first day of such period;
and

(5) since the beginning of such period, a transfer of shares of, or other transaction has
occurred or is contractually committed with respect to, the Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary, that constitutes an event that is contemplated by the definition of
“Specified Change of Control Event” (any such transaction, a “Specified Change

determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging
Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness for a period equal to the remaining term of such
Indebtedness).

outstanding on any date of determination, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence,
repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as
if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period, (iii) calculations shall also
give pro forma effect to any Specified Transaction that has occurred since the beginning of such
period but which has not yet been fully reflected in the relevant period (as determined and
calculated by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent), (iv) calculations shall
exclude any non-recurring costs and other expenses arising directly or indirectly as a consequence
of any Sale or Purchase or Specified Transaction and/or the implementation of any Group Initiative
and (v) “determined on a consolidated basis on the basis of IFRS,” “determined on the basis of

fair market value at the time of such transfer, in each case as determined in good

(1) ACMH, and any Subsidiary of the Parent (other than the Issuer and its Successor
Company) that at the time of determination is an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as
designated by the Board of Directors of the Parent in the manner provided below);
and

(2) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The Board of Directors of the Parent may designate any Subsidiary of the Parent (including

any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through
merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction, or Investment therein, but
excluding the Issuer and its Successor Company), to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(1) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, the Parent or any other
Subsidiary of the Parent which is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so
designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and


-----

(2) such designation and the Investment of the Parent in such Subsidiary complies with
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

In the event of any designation by the Board of Directors of the parent of a Subsidiary as

an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the Parent shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying
that such designation complies with the applicable foregoing conditions.

The Board of Directors of the Parent may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a

Restricted Subsidiary; _provided_ that immediately after giving effect to such designation (1) no
Default or Event of Default would result therefrom and (2)(x) the Parent could Incur at least £1.00
of additional Indebtedness under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of such designation
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, in each case,
on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation. Any such designation by the Board of
Directors of the Parent shall be evidenced to the Trustee by promptly filing with the Trustee a copy
of the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Parent giving effect to such designation or an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with or satisfied the foregoing
provisions.

“Voting Stock” of a Person means all classes of Capital Stock of such Person then

outstanding and normally entitled to vote in the election of directors.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A under

the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Notes sold outside the United
States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
**Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes**
will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered global form in minimum

denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes)
and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 thereof (in the case
of the Sterling Notes).

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry

**Interests”) and in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,**
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the
books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below,
Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through,

records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The
laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form.
The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the owners or holders of the Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or

Clearstream, as applicable (or its nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes
for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their
interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the

Registrar and any of its or their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or

Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be
equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with
the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under
the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes (as applicable)
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Euro Notes) and £100,000 principal amount (in the
case of the Sterling Notes) may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including

principal, premium, if any, interest, additional interest and Additional Amounts) to the Paying
Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The
Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account
of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature,
except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent_
described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global
Notes or of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts
that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or BookEntry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder

of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or its nominee) as
the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar or any of
its or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect

participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any
such payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or


-----

    - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any

participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are

the responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
customers registered in “street name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect

of, the Global Notes will be paid in pound sterling in the case of the Sterling Notes and in euro in
the case of the Euro Notes.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted

to be taken by a holder of the Notes (including the presentation of the Euro Notes and the Sterling
Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (as applicable) as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream
each reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated
form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to their
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance

with Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes
to persons in states that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Rule 144A Global Note will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer

_Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on_
transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the

form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption
(if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the

form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon delivery


-----

by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer is being made to a person who is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A that are
also Qualified Purchasers in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest

for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease
in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the
principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

In the event Additional Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN,

Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same
series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that
series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Notes, will not be eligible for transfer
to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who

takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry
Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive

Definitive Registered Notes:

    - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue

to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within
120 days; or

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered

through Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive

Registered Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar
or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of
Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive
Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new
Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed
will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered
Note in a denomination less than €100,000 (in the case of the Euro Notes) and £100,000 (in the


-----

case of the Sterling Notes) will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered

Notes for a period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on
the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for the selection of
the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange
of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the
transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among others, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture or the
Existing Indentures. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required
by law and permitted by the Indenture and Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive

Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note
is mutilated, upon receipt of an authentication order from the Issuer, and is surrendered to the
registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate
a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met.
The Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to
protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any
loss that any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge
for any expenses incurred by the Issuer in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become

or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a
new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the
case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor

first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See
“Notice to Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and

Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each
settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither
the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear

and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book

-----

entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services
to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship
with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act

on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest
to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of

the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to

facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of its or their respective agents will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pound sterling (in the case of the Sterling

Notes) and euro (in the case of the Euro Notes). Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against
payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and

will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important


-----

to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the

tax consequences, under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of
Notes, including, without limitation, the consequences of the receipt of interest and premium, if
any, on any sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein.

References in this discussion to the Notes acquired, owned, held or disposed of by holders

of the Notes include, except where otherwise expressly stated, the Book-Entry Interests held by
purchasers in the Notes in global form deposited with, and registered in the name of a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Issues**

The following is a general summary of certain UK tax consequences relating to the Notes

and is based on current UK tax law and HMRC published practice (which may not be binding on
HMRC), both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. It does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all UK tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not
address the consequences of any substitution of the Issuer or further issues of securities that will
form a single series with any of the series of Notes (notwithstanding that such substitution or
further issue may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the Notes). This summary does not
necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other
person. The summary below relates only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of their
Notes and any interest payable on their Notes and who hold their Notes as a capital investment.
Certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities, certain professional investors
and persons connected with the Issuer) may be subject to special rules and the summary below
does not apply to such holders of the Notes. The UK tax treatment of prospective holders of the
Notes (“Noteholders”) depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change
in the future. This summary does not purport to constitute legal or tax advice. If you are subject to
tax in any jurisdiction other than the UK or if you are in any doubt as to your tax position, you
should consult an appropriate professional advisor.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Withholding Tax_

Interest on the Notes may be payable without withholding or deduction for or on account

of UK income tax provided the Notes are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange”
within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”). The Exchange is a
recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities such as the Notes will be treated for these
purposes as listed on the Exchange if they are included in the Official List of the Exchange in
accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are
admitted to trading on the Exchange.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account

of UK income tax where the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is
paid) reasonably believes at the time the payment is made that (i) the person beneficially entitled
to the interest is a UK resident company, (ii) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a


-----

non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment
and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to bring into account when
calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax or (iii) the person to whom the payment is
made is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out
in Sections 935-937 of the ITA, provided that, in each case, HMRC has not given a direction that
the payment may not be made without that withholding or deduction.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the

Notes for or on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless an applicable
double tax treaty provides for a full exemption from (or a lower rate of) UK tax in relation to a
Noteholder and HMRC has issued a direction to the Issuer to pay interest to that Noteholder
without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the
relevant double tax treaty).

If an amount is withheld or deducted for or on account of UK income tax from a payment

of interest on the Notes (e.g., if the Notes are not or cease to be listed on the Exchange and no
other relief or exemption is available), Noteholders who are not resident in the UK may be able to
recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double
taxation treaty.

Any premium payable on redemption of the Notes may be treated as a payment of interest

for UK tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the UK withholding tax treatment described
above.

The Notes may be issued at an issue price of less than 100% of their principal amount. Any
discount element on any such Notes will not generally be subject to any withholding or deduction
for or on account, of United Kingdom income tax.

_Direct Assessment_

The interest and premium (if any) on the Notes is expected to have a UK source for tax

purposes and accordingly may be chargeable to UK tax by direct assessment (including selfassessment) even where paid without withholding or deduction. However, where the interest and
premium (if any) is paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK tax, the interest
will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of Noteholders (other than certain trustees) who are
not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where (i) the Noteholder carries on a trade,
profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency in the UK or, in the case of a corporate
holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, and (ii) the interest and
premium (if any) arises through or from, or the Notes are used or held by, that branch or agency
or is received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent establishment (as
applicable), in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of
agent) tax may be levied on the UK branch or agency, or permanent establishment.

Noteholders should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in

"Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts" above would not apply if HMRC sought to assess
directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to UK tax. However exemption from, or
reduction of, such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty.


-----

_Payments by the UK Guarantors_

The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by the Guarantors under the terms of the

Guarantees in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than
the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments by
the Guarantors may not be eligible for the exemptions from UK withholding tax described above
in relation to payments of interest. Accordingly, if the Guarantors make any such payments and
they have a UK source, these may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently
20%).

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”)_**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issuance of the Notes. Further, no UK stamp

duty or SDRT is payable on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, the Notes assuming that (i) the
interest on the Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of
the capital and (ii) any right on repayment of the Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal
amount of the Notes is reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a
similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official
List of the London Stock Exchange.

**_Provision of Information_**

HMRC have powers to obtain information and documents relating to the Notes, including

in relation to issues of and other transactions in the Notes, interest, payments treated as interest
and other payments derived from the Notes. This may include the value of the Notes, details of the
beneficial owners of the Notes, of the person for whom the Notes are held and of the persons to
whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid. Information may be obtained from a
range of persons including persons who effect or are a party to such transactions on behalf of
others, registrars and administrators of such transactions, the registered holders of the Notes,
persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes and persons
by or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited.

Information obtained by HMRC may, in certain circumstances, be exchanged by HMRC

with the tax authorities of other jurisdictions.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the

purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only
with the Notes that are held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) for U.S. federal income tax purposes by a U.S.
holder (as defined below) who acquires the Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering
price.

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is for U.S.

federal income tax purposes any of the following:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;


-----

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax

purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of

its source; or

   - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States

and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations
(“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and Treasury Regulations, rulings and

judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively,
so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.
We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding
the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions
concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are
different from those described below.

This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation and does not

address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or state, local, nonU.S. or other tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular
circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income
tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

    - tax consequences to U.S. holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as

brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the
mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, financial institutions,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other
pass-through entities or arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or an
investor in such entity), U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

    - tax consequences to U.S. holders holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,

constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle;

    - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or

    - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal

income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon
the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner
in a partnership holding the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors.


-----

If you are considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult your tax advisors

concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other U.S. federal
tax laws (such as estate or gift tax laws) and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

An IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) could result in a taxable

exchange of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize gain
or loss on the Notes (although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the
difference, if any, between the issue price of the deemed newly issued Notes (as determined for
U.S. federal income tax purposes), and your tax basis in the Notes, and have a new holding period
and tax basis in the Notes. Any such gain or loss will be taxed under the rules described below
under “—Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement and Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes.”
If the fair market value of the Notes at the time of such taxable exchange were lower than the
stated redemption price by more than a de minimis amount, you may be required to include the
difference as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of
the receipt of cash. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences to you in the event of an IPO Pushdown.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will generally be

taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which
includes any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional
amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit any
foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit
foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest
income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source
income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive
category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with
respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which
you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex.
You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit (or
deduction in lieu of such credit) under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in euro and interest on the Sterling Notes will

be payable in pound sterling. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the interest received, determined by translating the euro or pound sterling (as
applicable) received at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. You will not recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if you

are otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, you may determine the amount of income


-----

recognized with respect to such interest (including any additional amounts) in accordance with
either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the
Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average spot rate of
exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued or, in
the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period
within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the
spot rate of exchange on:

    - the last day of the accrual period,

    - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or

    - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the

end of the accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to

all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS. You should consult your tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election.

In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting upon receipt of an interest payment

on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S.
source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of such payment (determined by translating the euro or pound sterling received at the spot
rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income you previously included in income with respect to such payment (as determined above),
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement and Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, you

will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued
but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included
in income as discussed above in “—Payments of Interest”) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note.
Your adjusted tax basis in the Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you
purchased your Note with euro or pound sterling, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value
of the euro or pound sterling paid for such Note determined at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of
in a taxable disposition for euro or pound sterling, the amount realized generally will be the U.S.
dollar value of the euro or pound sterling received based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on
the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash
method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market, euro or pound
sterling paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the
settlement date of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you may elect the
same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of the Notes traded on an established


-----

securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by
you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be

capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year.
Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, derived with respect to capital
assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as U.S.
source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the

principal amount of a Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and
generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is
your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro or pound sterling on the date of purchase and
the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S.
dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the
case of cash basis or electing accrual basis U.S. holders, the settlement dates of such purchase or
taxable disposition, provided the Note is traded on an established securities market). The amount
of exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Note (with respect to both principal and
accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of
the Note.

**_Exchange Gain or Loss with respect to Euro or Pound Sterling_**

Your tax basis in the euro or pound sterling received as interest on a Note or on the sale,

exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will be equal to the U.S.
dollar value of the euro or pound sterling, as applicable, determined at the time of receipt. Any
gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the euro or pound
sterling will be ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) under the

Indenture. Any Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S from time to time may be issued
with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the
applicable series of Notes previously issued under the Indenture without being fungible with such
series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If you are considering the purchase of Notes
sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Notes or in the secondary market, you
should consult your tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences
to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Notes, including with respect to the
potential issuance of Additional Notes that are not fungible with the applicable series of initial
notes issued under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which nevertheless are
not capable of being separately identified.


-----

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could

be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be
reported to the IRS including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption
or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note, such as a Note, or foreign currency received
in respect of a foreign currency note, to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption
or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are
considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult with your tax advisors to determine the
tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement
to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of principal and

interest on a Note, or the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note paid to you, unless
you are an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrate this fact. Additionally, if you fail to
provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments, fail either to report
in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup
withholding on any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup

withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your U.S. federal income tax
liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. You are urged to consult
your tax advisors regarding backup withholding and information reporting requirements relating
to your ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,

subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for the Notes held in accounts maintained by
certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified
Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the Notes.
You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to your
ownership of the Notes and potential penalties for failure to comply.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and

holding of the Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the United
States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that are
subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts, and other arrangements that
are subject to Section 4975 of the United Stated Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”) and (iii)
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any of the foregoing
described in clauses (i) and (ii) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) referred
to herein as a (“Plan”)).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on those persons who are fiduciaries with

respect to a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”).
Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over
the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such
an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, the

fiduciary of a Plan should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws, including, without limitation, general
fiduciary requirements of ERISA, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, the
requirement that a Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
Plan, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any
Similar Laws. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible
fiduciary of a Covered Plan by taking into account the Covered Plan’s particular circumstances
and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters
discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in
which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the Notes.

Governmental plans, certain church plans, non-U.S. Plans and other plans, while not

subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction
provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar
Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before acquiring the Notes.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving

the assets of a Covered Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified
persons”) having certain relationships to such Covered Plans, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged
in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the Covered Plan


-----

who engaged in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of

the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Covered Plan with respect to
which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the agents, the Trustee, the lenders under the Issuer’s
existing credit facility or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified
person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of
Covered Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which
such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE
84-14 (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”),
PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 9560 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions effected by in-house asset managers) (“Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also
a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code to a person investing in the Notes for adequate consideration (within the
meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) that is a party in
interest or disqualified person solely because it is a service provider to a Plan or because of a
relationship to such a service provider or both, provided that neither such person nor any of its
affiliates (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders
any investment advice with respect to the assets of the ERISA Plan involved in the transaction (the
“Service Provider Exemption”). Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and
limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring Notes in reliance
on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable.
There can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions or the Service Provider
Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving the Notes.

Any insurance company proposing to invest assets of its general account in the Notes

should consider the extent to which such investment would be subject to the requirements of Title
I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank, 510 U.S. 86 (1993), and
the enactment of Section 401(c) of ERISA on August 20, 1996. In particular, such an insurance
company should consider (i) the exemptive relief granted by the U.S. Department of Labor for
transactions involving insurance company general accounts in PTCE 95-60 and (ii) if such
exemptive relief is not available, whether its acquisition of the Notes will be permissible under the
final regulations issued under Section 401(c) of ERISA. The final regulations provide guidance on
which assets held by an insurance company constitute “plan assets” for purposes of the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The regulations do not
exempt the assets of insurance company general accounts from treatment as “plan assets” to the
extent they support certain participating annuities issued to ERISA Plans after December 31, 1998.


-----

**Representations and Further Considerations**

By its acquisition of a Note of any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent

transferee thereof will be deemed to have represented and warranted, on each day from the date
on which such purchaser or transferee, as applicable, acquires its interest in such Notes through
and including the date on which such purchaser or transferee, as applicable, disposes of its interest
in such Notes, either that (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan, or (ii) its
purchase and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation
under any applicable Similar Law.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due

to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in
non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that each Plan fiduciary or other
person who proposes to use assets of any Plan to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein)
should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, or any other applicable
Similar Laws, to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement
of ERISA, the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Barclays Bank PLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE,

Citigroup Global Markets Limited, DNB Markets, a division of DNB Bank ASA, HSBC Bank plc,
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, Merrill Lynch International and NatWest Markets Plc are the
Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be
dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the
Issuer, the principal amount of the Notes as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover

page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may
from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,

taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Initial Purchasers may offer
and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for

and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain
legal opinions by counsel. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement,
the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase all of the Notes sold under the Purchase Agreement
if any of the Notes are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement further provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless

the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act,
and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect
thereof. The Parent has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates will offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose
of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (except the Notes and
the Guarantees) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including
the date that is 60 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the lead representatives of the Initial Purchasers nominated under the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities

laws of any jurisdiction. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in transactions
not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities laws,
including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Initial Purchasers will not offer or
sell the Notes except to QIBs who are also Qualified Purchasers, or pursuant to offers and sales to
non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In
addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in
compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.


-----

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and
agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that it (i) has only

communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, within the meaning
of Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has
complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made for the Notes

to be listed on the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. However, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing
or that such listing will be maintained. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they
presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial
Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without
notice. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance
and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to
you. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our structure—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about      , 2021,

which will be the      business day following the date of this Offering Memorandum (such
settlement being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades
in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to the
delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle
in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of
delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in

the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to
cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a
greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial
Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short
position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be
downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely
affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the

syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes


-----

or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the
Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the

direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that
the Initial Purchasers will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced,
will not be discontinued without notice. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity
of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our structure—There
_may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may_
_be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price

of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These
transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the
Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the
Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30
calendar days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the Offering and 60
calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in

various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial
advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage,
in investment banking (including advisory and/or hedging) and/ or commercial banking
transactions with, and may perform services for, the Issuer and its respective affiliates (including
TDR Capital and Arrow Global Group Limited) in the ordinary course of business for which they
have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, certain of the Initial
Purchasers have provided TDR Capital, Arrow Global Group Limited and the Issuer with M&A
advisory services in connection with the Acquisition for which they have received fees and
commissions. Each of Barclays Bank PLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Citigroup Global Markets
Limited, DNB (UK) Limited, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets plc, Merrill Lynch International and NatWest Markets PLC, or their respective
affiliates are mandated lead arrangers, original lenders and/or bookrunners under the Bridge
Facilities Agreement, which will be repaid with the proceeds of this Offering, and the Revolving
Facility Agreement. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and
actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments
(including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or their
respective affiliates (including the Notes). The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive
allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future
trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending
relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including


-----

potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long
and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes is advised to consult legal counsel prior to making

any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby. The Notes and the
Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other
applicable securities laws and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of any U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation
S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes only:

    - in the United States, to QIBs (as defined in Rule 144A) that are also Qualified

Purchasers (as defined in the Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act) in
compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - outside of the United States, to “non U.S. persons” as defined in Rule 902 under the

U.S. Securities Act in compliance with Regulation S.

Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the

exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by
Rule 144A.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this Offering and the

closing date, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
if such offer or sale is made other than pursuant to Rule 144A.

If you purchase Notes in this Offering, you will be deemed to have represented, agreed and

acknowledged as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation
S used herein as defined therein):

(1) The Notes (including the Guarantees) are being offered in a transaction not
involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S.
Securities Act, that the Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not
be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and that if in the future you decide to
offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes (including the
Guarantees), such Notes (including the Guarantees) may be offered, resold, pledged
or otherwise transferred only (i) in the United States, to QIBs that are Qualified
Purchasers in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) outside the
United States, to “non U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S (and are not
purchasing the Notes for the account or benefit of a U.S. person, other than a

person representing us or the Initial Purchasers have made any representation to it
with respect to us or the Offering and the sale of the Notes (including the
Guarantees) other than the information contained in or incorporated by reference in
this Offering Memorandum and (ii) it has had access to such financial and other

and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends.


-----

7. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the

Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued,
without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of
that series, including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such Additional

underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any of the foregoing
described in clauses (i) and (ii) or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes (or any
interest therein) by such holder will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**England and Wales**

The U.S. and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and
Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first
be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the
English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and
enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among
others) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over

the original proceedings according to English rules of private international law;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive, on the merits and for a debt or definite

sum of money; and

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of

a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an
English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law.

An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court
that:

    - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy or the European Convention on

Human Rights;

    - the U.S. judgment includes an assessment of damages that has been arrived at by

doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss
or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading
Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under
Section 1 of the Act;

    - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of

natural or substantial justice;

    - the U.S. judgment is a judgment in respect of the same subject matter involving the

same parties as previously determined by an English court or another court whose
judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales and is inconsistent with the
earlier judgment of such court;


-----

    - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant

limitation period;

    - the party against whom the judgment is to be enforced is not subject to the jurisdiction

of English courts; or

    - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes

under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in
a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England and Wales

judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the
preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England
and Wales. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction
and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales, instead of
the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Netherlands**

The Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in

the Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be
enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment
obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the

reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United
States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable
in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. However, a final
and enforceable judgment rendered by the relevant federal or state court in the United States
against any of the Dutch Guarantors with respect to its payment obligations would generally be
upheld and be regarded by a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction as conclusive evidence when
requested to render a judgment in accordance with that judgment by the relevant federal or state
court in the United States, without substantive re-examination or re litigation of the merits of the
subject matter thereof, if the Dutch court finds that (i) the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or
state court in the United States is based on international acceptable standards, (ii) the judgment
was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of
justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the recognition of that
judgment does not contravene with Dutch public policy (openbare orde), and (iv) the judgment is
not irreconcilable with a judgment of a Dutch court given between the same parties, or with an
earlier judgment of a foreign court given between the same parties in a dispute involving the same
cause of action and subject matter, provided that such earlier judgment fulfils the conditions
necessary for it to be given effect in the Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with

applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and


-----

commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given
that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands
and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the

Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a
foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange.

Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies

available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the
power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent
proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize

damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

**Guernsey**

The U.S. and Guernsey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.

In Guernsey, foreign judgments can be recognized by the Royal Court of Guernsey

(the ”Guernsey Court”) either under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement)
(Guernsey) Law, 1957, as amended (the “1957 Law”), which provides a statutory framework for
the enforcement of judgments made in a reciprocating country and of a kind to which the 1957
Law applies, or under the principles of common law. Save for very exceptional and limited
circumstances, if the 1957 Law does not apply then the common law prevails.

For jurisdictions not included in the 1957 Law, including the U.S., a judgment obtained in

a court in the U.S. against a Guernsey company (or its directors or officers) cannot be registered
or enforced in Guernsey, pursuant to the 1957 Law, but may be enforceable by separate action on
the judgment in accordance with Guernsey common law rules.

To enforce the judgment of a court of the U.S. in Guernsey, the claimant would be required

to bring fresh proceedings before the Guernsey Court, suing on the foreign judgment itself and
applying for summary judgment if the case is placed on the pleadings list (essentially, where the
case is defended). In such an action, the Guernsey Court is unlikely to re-examine the merits of
the original case decided by a U.S. court.

According to current practice, the Guernsey Court will (subject to the following matters)

enforce the judgment of a court in the United States in in personam proceedings provided that the
following conditions inter alia are satisfied:

(a) the judgment is for a debt or fixed or ascertainable sum of money (provided that the

judgment does not relate to U.S. penal, revenue or other public laws);

(b) the judgment is final and conclusive; and


-----

(c) the court in the U.S. had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over

the judgment debtor in accordance with the Guernsey rules of private international law.

The Guernsey Court will not, however, enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor

satisfies the Guernsey Court that:

(a) the judgment was given in proceedings that were in breach of principles of natural or

substantial justice;

(b) enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to Guernsey public policy;

(c) the foreign court did not have jurisdiction to give that judgment according to Guernsey

rules on the conflict of laws;

(d) there was fraud on the part of the U.S. court pronouncing judgment;

(e) there was fraud on the part of the party in whose favor the judgment was given;

(f) enforcement proceedings are time barred under the Guernsey laws on

prescription/limitation;

(g) the foreign judgment is not for a definite sum of money (which is not a sum in respect

of taxes or penalties) or is not final and conclusive;

(h) the foreign judgment was against a person who was entitled to immunity from the

courts of that country; and

(i) the foreign court had no jurisdiction in circumstances where the judgment debtor was,

at the time the proceedings were instituted, present in the foreign country and the
bringing of proceedings in that U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which
the dispute was to be settled and the judgment debtor did not agree to the proceedings
being brought in that U.S. court, nor counterclaimed or otherwise submitted to the
jurisdiction.

If the Guernsey Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a judgment of a United

States court, the Guernsey judgment would be enforceable by the methods generally available for
the enforcement of Guernsey judgments. These give the Guernsey Court discretion whether to
allow enforcement by any particular method. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain a
Guernsey judgment or to enforce any Guernsey judgment: if the judgment debtor is subject to any
insolvent administration or similar proceedings; if there is delay; if an appeal is pending or
anticipated against the Guernsey judgment in Guernsey or against the foreign judgment in the
courts of the United States; or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the
judgment creditor. Additionally, any security interest may affect the circumstances where the
Guernsey Court provides judicial assistance to persons empowered under foreign bankruptcy law
to act on behalf of an insolvent company and/or in relation to the enforcement of a judgment debt.


-----

**_Jurisdiction_**

A foreign court is considered to have jurisdiction where one of four criteria is met, being

any of the following:

(a) where the respondent to the order sought to be enforced was, at the time the
proceedings were instituted, present in the foreign jurisdiction (and where that
“person” is a corporate entity, where it is resident or maintains a fixed place of
business in the foreign jurisdiction);

(b) where the respondent to the order sought to be enforced was a claimant or
counterclaimant in the proceedings in the foreign court;

(c) where the respondent to the order sought to be enforced submitted to the jurisdiction
of the foreign court by voluntarily appearing in the proceedings; or

(d) where the respondent to the order sought to be enforced agreed, prior to the
commencement of the proceedings, to submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.

**_Sum of Money_**

It is a generally accepted principle of common law in Guernsey that for the Guernsey Court

to recognize a foreign judgment, that judgment needs to be for a definite sum of money and must
not include deductions or additions for unspecified amounts such as tax, nor can it include
penalties.

**_Final and Conclusive_**

A foreign judgment which is final and conclusive, for the purposes of recognition under

Guernsey common law, is one which cannot be varied by the court which pronounced it,
notwithstanding that there may be a right of appeal.

**Jersey**

The following is a summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court

judgments in Jersey.

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order
to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of
competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate
the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to the qualifications below) and
it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is
no valid defense to it).


-----

Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is

conditional upon (among other things) the following:

(a) the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to
Jersey conflict of laws principles;

(b) the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being
final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum
of money (although there are circumstances where non-money judgments can also
be recognized);

(c) the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges
of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

(d) the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise
multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and
not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading
Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

(e) the recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment is not contrary to public
policy in Jersey, including that the judgment was not obtained by fraud or duress
and the observance of the principles of natural justice which require that documents
in the US proceeding were properly served on the defendant and that the defendant
was given the right to be heard and represented by counsel in a free and fair trial
before an impartial tribunal; and

(f) there being no earlier judgment of another court of competent jurisdiction between
the same parties on the same issues as are dealt with in the judgment to be enforced.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and

commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is
questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the
original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon
U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Portugal**

Whitestar Asset Solutions, S.A. and AGHL Portugal Investments Holdings, S.A. are

incorporated under Portuguese law and have their registered offices in Portugal. Civil liabilities
based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in Portugal, either in an
original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The U.S. and Portugal currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state


-----

court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Portugal. In order
to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Portugal, the claim must be re-litigated before a Portuguese
court. The competent court for the review and confirmation in Portugal of a foreign decision is the
Portuguese Court of Appeal with jurisdiction in the area where the person against whom the
foreign decision is to be enforced is domiciled. However, a final and enforceable judgment
rendered by the relevant federal or state court in the United States against each of Whitestar Asset
Solutions, S.A. or AGHL Portugal Investments Holdings, S.A. with respect to their payment
obligations would generally be upheld and be regarded by a Portuguese court of competent
jurisdiction as conclusive evidence when requested to render a judgment in accordance with that
judgment by the relevant federal or state court in the United States, without substantive reexamination or re-litigation of the merits of the subject matter thereof, if the following
requirements are verified: (i) the judgment is final, translated into Portuguese and apostilled and
no doubts exist about the authenticity of the document and the contents of the judgment; (ii) the
judgment shall not be contrary to Portuguese public policy and the obligation that the petitioner
tries to execute has to be lawful in Portugal; (iii) there shall not be a pending proceeding between
the same parties and in relation to the same issues in Portugal; (iv) there shall not be a judgment
rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in Portugal or in another
country; (v) the matters under discussion are not related to matters in which the Portuguese courts
consider themselves exclusively competent and the competency of such foreign courts is not
obtained by unlawfully circumventing applicable rules; and (vi) the rights of defense of the
defendant should have been protected when rendering the foreign judgment (princípio do
_contraditório), including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient_
time for the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts and notification (citação),
and with respect for the principle of equal treatment of the parties.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with

applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in Portugal judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such
judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Portuguese court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in Portugal and predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in

Portugal will be subject to the rules of Portuguese civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in
a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND**

**SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees

and the security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which Guarantees or Collateral are being,
or are expected to be, provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency
or a similar nature could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of
organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple
jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the
Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral.

Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in England

and Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Netherlands. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer
or the Guarantors experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings.

**England and Wales**

**_United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU_**

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the UK exercised its right pursuant to

Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be
a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result,
a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK
is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the
“EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted
by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that
EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020

at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be
treated as a member state of the EU, including for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a member state of EU.

The EU Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the

Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2)
Regulations 2019) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions
regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the EU Insolvency Regulation,
providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member
States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the EU Insolvency Regulation to
continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main
proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the EU Insolvency Regulation
will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day.


-----

Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will
continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in other Member States, and will
receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings.

The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency

(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day)
came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK.
In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP
Day EU Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations)
expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of
a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue,
adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and:

    - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or

    - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an

establishment in the UK.

These tests are consistent with the EU Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper

jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those
proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction
(i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and
that (A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying
for the winding-up order and (B) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the
company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign
company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even
if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company
incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration.

While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect

of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will
significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings
in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and
_restructuring proceedings”)._

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies

incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (each an “English company”). The courts of
England and Wales would have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English
insolvency laws, over an English company.

In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the

UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in Great Britain and
which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the
world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., nonEnglish) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts


-----

as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non
main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out
a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign
jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the
UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the
English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of
the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main
proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see
below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including
commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but
the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property
(albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon
recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English
court).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a

number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a
creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors
or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and
which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of
liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving
by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions

with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings. On the Issue Date, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial
Guarantees and the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Initial Collateral. English
insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an
English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to

certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application
of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the
Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that
investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of

the EU Insolvency Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency Amendment Regulations has
been substantially amended) provide that an administrator may be appointed (whether in or out of
court) in respect of a company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA state, a
company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in a member state of the EU (other
than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in the UK or a company
(wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a member state of the EU and an “establishment” in the
UK, and upon request from courts in other parts of the UK or certain other countries or territories.


-----

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an
administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the
relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration
order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay

its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities) in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is
presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand
for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of three weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment
debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of
rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following
would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for
the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither
of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not
unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out
below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such

company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the
company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and
different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain

requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s)
to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior
ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on Insolvency” ). An administrator
may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided
that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the
administrator applies (i) the net proceeds from the disposal; and (ii) any additional money required
to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net
amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an

administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and
no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of
the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission
apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the
hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on
similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not
yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such


-----

time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the
appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the
administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or ten
business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined

circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property
notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium
in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit
claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see
further below).

If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce

any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court
or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial
collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the
company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith
without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to

enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not
be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement)
while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent
of the administrator.

**_Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges_**

As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an

administration order in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator
can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying
floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different
procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator

to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a
“qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the
ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the
security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the
Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will
apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement
and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the
Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument) as well as fulfilling certain
other technical requirements. If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator
can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a


-----

qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who
appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to
which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an
undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any
administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property
must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by

an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to
it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports
to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section
29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to
the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one
such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security
document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carveouts, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is
covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge
in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and
other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the
time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no
statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this
test.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company

will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of
floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This
applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over
£10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap
being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except
where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is
£600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the
cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge
realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency
officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of
secured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to
set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and
make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising
under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements
(No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/ 3226)), as set out below.


-----

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating

charge security:

(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to

cash and, where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security
financial collateral arrangement, use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet
administration expenses (which include the administrator’s remuneration and can include the costs
of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to
the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a
floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided
the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and the fixed
charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created
or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and
expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable
out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in
priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes,
a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary
course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating
charge security may be subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Grant
_of floating charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise_
under a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the
expenses of the insolvent estate, (ii) subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as
employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims, certain unpaid
pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC) and (iii) as noted above,
subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured creditors; (g)
an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge
without the prior consent of the charge holder or court approval but the floating charge holder
retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject
to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s
purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in
question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to
produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale
of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge
holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security

interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking
effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld
as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things,
whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal
in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a


-----

purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the
ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, (a) the

proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to
the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that
any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole
of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating
charge”.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006,

the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise
or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) in respect of the
company’s obligations to those creditors. An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in
respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up
under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also
pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and
the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI
is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an
amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or
jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing
or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for
financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a
scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily
determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present
case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will

vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in
a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company
and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing
75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of
creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be
binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the
vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court
at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant
procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of
those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion
as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications
being made or reject the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to
Companies House for registration. A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or


-----

variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third parties in order to ensure
the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does

not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangement_**

In order to propose a company voluntary arrangement, a company must either (i) be

registered in England and Wales or Scotland; or (ii) be incorporated in an EEA State; or (iii) if not
incorporated in an EEA State, have its center of main interests in the UK or an EU member state
(other than Denmark). Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its
administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the
company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between
the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts.
Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision
procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were
or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot
affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company
voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority
to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential
creditors, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved

by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and
no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot
be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it
is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole
of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s
shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of
the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a
shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the
shareholders should prevail.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not

automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Filings_**

The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English

company purports to create security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should
be delivered to the Registrar of Companies within 21 days after the date of creation of the security
in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of the CA06. Failing this, the security created by the
security document will (subject as mentioned in the above Chapter) be void against a liquidator or
administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The application of the above Chapter to a
security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In addition, the
following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in section


-----

859A(6) of the CA06): (i) a charge in favor of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in
connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning
of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at
Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA06 by or under
any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009).
Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may
provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable

principles regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and
contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees and security).

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only

take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the
requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing under the hand of
the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only;
and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these
requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment.
Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including,
without limitation: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent
legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable
interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at
which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that
equitable interest. The first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or
constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

**_PSC Regime_**

Pursuant to Part 21A of the CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the CA06), certain

UK incorporated companies and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph,
each a relevant company) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities
that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or
other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA06 (for the purposes of this
paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant
companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule
1B to the CA06. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of
any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the CA06, for example,
a share in the relevant company): (A) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void;
(B) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (C) no shares may be issued in right of the
interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (D) except in a liquidation, no
payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether
in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of the security

interests over the ability of the Security Agent to enforce its rights under the English security
documents.

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

As noted above (see “—United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU”), the EU Insolvency

Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) provides that, in addition to
any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, a company which has its
COMI in the UK, or which has its center of main interests in a Member State and an establishment
in the UK, may be subject to compulsory liquidation or (with confirmation by the court) a
creditors’ voluntary liquidation in the UK. In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign
company has neither its COMI or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an
unregistered company if the court considers there to be (i) a sufficient connection with England
and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying
for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the
company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction.

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized
and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of
priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has
completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There
are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary
liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each
case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key
difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company
are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12
months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the
compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than
as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once
in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory
liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies
with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general
jurisdiction (see above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to
companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a

voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any
disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up
is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security
interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein) and will not prevent
a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain
exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to
have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.


-----

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced which temporarily restricts

the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions (and previously restricted courts from
granting winding-up orders). With effect from October 1, 2021, the temporary restrictions
previously in place expired and were replaced by new more limited regulations (set out in Schedule
10 of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, as amended by the Corporate
Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Amendment of Schedule 10) (No.2)
Regulations 2021). These introduced temporary targeted measures to limit the use of winding-up
petitions. These measures: (a) raise the threshold upon which a winding up petition may be
presented from £750 to £10,000; (b) allow a creditor to present a winding up petition only after
expiry of a 21-day period during which the debtor has failed to provide a proposal for repayment
satisfactory to the creditor following service of the requisite notice by the creditor; and (c) prevent
landlords petitioning to wind up tenants for unpaid rent arrears (or any other amount that a tenant
is liable to pay under a lease) arising as a result of coronavirus. The measures will remain in place
until March 31, 2022.

Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the

company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the
company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of
security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect

of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As
a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic
stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory
of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means
creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce
their security).

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company,

to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to
sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge
antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property,

which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot
be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act.
A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing
financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power
does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to
disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not
apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under
the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as
a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the
loss or debt as a debt in the winding-up.


-----

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued

as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize
the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the
company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed

into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property
applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part
(as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims
of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are
distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees

an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual
dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration
or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is
mandatory and automatic as at the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has
given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is
effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount
owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its
claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor,
receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off
will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other
things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of
mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of,
insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of setoff, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which
insolvency set-off applies).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of

the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors
with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial
ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary
interest only;

    - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency

Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any
unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the
moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority premoratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company
did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the
moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting


-----

in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank
equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they
are paid;

    - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting

out the order of priority in which expenses are paid);

    - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent

company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and
salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a
maximum of £800 per person and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between
one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary

preferential debts and include VAT, PAYE income tax, employee national insurance contributions
and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule
6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

    - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part

(as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors;

    - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their

security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge
in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was recharacterized as a floating charge;

    - Seventh ranking:

`o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured

shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest
on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency
proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the
insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as
secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part
unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the
secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

`o` secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the

applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the
Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after
the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an
administration which has been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or


-----

the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are
sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such
security recoveries; and

`o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of

the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that
all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency
conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17,
2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and

    - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full,

any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent
company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the

terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

See “—Administration and Floating Charges” above for a description of the Prescribed

Part.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English

company of security or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most
cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified
period (as set out in more detail below) after the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore,
if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company,
he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company. Further,
the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds)
to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue,

preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In
administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an
administration order is submitted, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at
court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a
compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is
presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes
a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the
purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and

invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director,
or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (i)


-----

the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (ii) a relative of the individual; or (iii) a relative
of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a
relative of the individual; or (v) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company.
A person is an associate of any person with whom they are in partnership, and of the husband, wife
or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom they are in partnership.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both

companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons
who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control
of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as
consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as
replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or

of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance
with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third
or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which
has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to
be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees

and security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an

assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation
of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such
security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a
transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no
consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or
money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction

or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its
debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted
within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of

action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction
was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in
which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must
demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings.

In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into

the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it
did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court

can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the
transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee
or setting aside any security interests granted of guarantees, although there is protection for a third
party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the
court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are
the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in
good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a
sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a party to
the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time
when they were a creditor of the company.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an

assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation
of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such
security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the

English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better
position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor
or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction

or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its
debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted
within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected
person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency.

If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may

make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that
preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or
setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described
above with respect to transactions at an undervalue. However, the court will only make such an
order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was
unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to
produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a
connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the
company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect,
and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence
(it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency).


-----

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an

undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond
the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise
prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or
may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An
application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed
administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant CVA or, subject to certain conditions,
the FCA, PRA and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable
of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company
in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no
time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory limitation periods)
and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time or as a result of the transaction,
or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court

can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the
transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction,
which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees.
The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person,
whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such
an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than
the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and
will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the
transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action)

can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if,
having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were)
such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary
principles of fair dealing.

Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a

transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise
proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company
enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The
court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the
transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the
transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require
any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums
already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the
purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third


-----

parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of
the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company

within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the
beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of
granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes
unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid
except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the
creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). The requirement for the English obligor to
be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the
floating charge is granted to a connected person.

No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required

to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant fixed charge; this will happen automatically if the
statutory requirements are fulfilled.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement”

under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating
charge will not be invalidated on this basis.

As referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge

being re-characterized as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently
re-characterized has been granted within the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could
render the charge invalid except to the value of the consideration provided.

**_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003_**

The Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (the

“Financial Collateral Regulations”), apply in respect of certain security interests granted over,
and certain title transfer arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together, “financial collateral
**arrangements”). Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash,**
financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in
companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions.
The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive
2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral
arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the UK. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the
process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal
framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial

Collateral Regulations, certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which
(amongst other things) remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions
relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance
by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For


-----

example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to
be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory
moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into
administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the
security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral
to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security
interests have become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has
been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted

fundamental reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these
measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative
process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the
following:

_(a)_ _Moratorium_

The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to

provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable

to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include
certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and
securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has
incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the
arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). From October 1, 2021, ineligible
companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has
entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding
twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the
scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the
capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the
criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from
being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also
change from time to time.

Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a

moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. From October 1, 2021, directors must apply to
court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition,
whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for
creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible
overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium.

Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company

that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a
monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately


-----

confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company
as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed,
a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is
unlikely to be rescued as a going concern.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to

certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts,
including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services
(which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the
moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be
met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such
liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during
the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against

the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing
security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such
permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the
company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security
financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration and floating charges,” “—Grant
_of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above)_
or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to
a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this
new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an

administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration
or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority premoratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any
capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the
administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such
creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).

Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the

moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the
company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the
monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the
company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect
of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total
amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total
unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary
course.

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business

day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further
20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements
from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying


-----

conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect
to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all
moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment
holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be
available:

    - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement

(but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured
creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the
extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or
unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium
debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or
may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the
right to vote;

    - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

    - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal

is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

    - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring

plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan).

_(b)_ _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_

The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination

clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and
services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings
against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement,
winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights
to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are
preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose
before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is
suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency
proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during
the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are
paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency
practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the
contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in
financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this
new prohibition.

_(c)_ _Restructuring Plan_

The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement

under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind
one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to


-----

the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available
to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection
to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of
company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most
situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may
also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company).

Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have

encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect,
its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or
arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or
mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of
requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans
(unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano
Convention.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed

restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting
of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court
will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the
proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the
creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition
test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or
arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless
the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court
will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would
be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned).
Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be
excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them
from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has
jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to
vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every
stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in
the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’

and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the
creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by
proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a
majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made
within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of
“moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may
not be compromised under the plan without their consent.

Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if

the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring


-----

plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more
classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting
classes, if:

(a) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if

the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative”
(i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan
not sanctioned); and

(b) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a

class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine
economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether

they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to
Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required
to register particulars, published in the Gazette).

_(d)_ _So-called “Henry VIII” powers_

The Act (as amended by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus)

(Change of Expiry Date) Regulations 2021) further confers on the UK government some extensive
powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation
under delegated regulations until April 29, 2022. For example, regulations may be made to amend
or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain
entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s corporate
duties and liabilities.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim

for their debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into
pounds sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to
the exchange rates prevailing on the “relevant date” (generally speaking, being the date on which
the company entered administration or liquidation). This provision overrides any agreement
between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration,

holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount
proved between the date on which such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and
the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. The
English Supreme Court’s ruling in the Lehman Brothers case established that any such holder of
the Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall
in the value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.


-----

**_Foreign Laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the

obligor of any debt or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of
the property or rights subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and
Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity, priority and enforceability of that security
may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third Party Rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts

and insurance policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the

beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to
which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English obligor or over shares of the English obligor

are typically, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises
where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor
retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to
equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests

over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or
(in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the
disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with
significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations

of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a
transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association.
To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the
guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English
company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question
by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006
provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If
the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may


-----

be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being
set aside by a court.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions

is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’
jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as
comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which has been adopted in a

number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the UK, where it was implemented by the
Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK
insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI
of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the UK) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI
is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the UK) upon
application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will
depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the
jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for
recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the
proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an
establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of

arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties
regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of
civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague
**Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s**
pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be
available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual
obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans

is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the
scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the
enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or
whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions
to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter
position).

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK

proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states.


-----

As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a
replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the
EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving
the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased
complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be

more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU
member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member
states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private
international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to
open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases
where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather
than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU
member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract
law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings

across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the
past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and
to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as
a result.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

Arrow SMA GP I Limited and Arrow Global SMA I LP (the “Jersey Guarantors”) are

incorporated and established under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of an insolvency
of either of the Jersey Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are
two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “en désastre” and winding up (including
just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). The principal type of insolvency
procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court
of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended
(the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a
“declaration”). On a declaration of “en désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor
vests automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect
from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the
debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court,
continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a
secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the Royal
Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security
Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the
proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has
no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal
proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal
proceedings to recover the balance of the debt.


-----

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a

winding up of an insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to
Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies
**Law”). On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors**
may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand
in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate
disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of
the winding up, no action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of
the Royal Court. The shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence
the creditors’ winding-up. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party
may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any
power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012
Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities
owed, the secured party has no other remedy against the company without leave of the Royal
Court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up
procedure, when the company is dissolved.

The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound

by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the
course of its winding up if (among others) three quarters in number and value of the creditors
acceded to the arrangement.

**_Compromises and arrangements with creditors_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law,

the Royal Court may sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “Scheme”) between a Jersey
company and its creditors or shareholders (or a class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on
application of the company (or a creditor or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a
liquidator), order a meeting to be called at which the proposed Scheme must be agreed to by a
majority in number representing:

    - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

    - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court

considers the sanction of the Scheme. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of
the relevant class of either of them) agree to the Scheme and, following such agreement, the Royal
Court sanctions the Scheme, the Scheme is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or on the
relevant class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the
company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies

Law, the Royal Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose
property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a


-----

procedure which is instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any
guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at
an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of “en désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to
examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of
entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of
the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey

Companies Law, the Royal Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company
whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding
up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security interest) given by the company to
any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “en désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law
and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that
define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering
into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate transactions, onerous property, disclaimer and customary law fraudulent_**
**_dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies

Law, the Royal Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose
property has been declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set
aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a
three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of
“désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The
Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months

following the date of the declaration of “en désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey
Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months following the commencement of a creditors’
winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to
include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated
outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a
liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and

liabilities of the company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the
company/Viscount from all liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement
of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the declaration but shall not, except so far as is


-----

necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor from liability, affect the rights or
liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is
deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing
as a creditor in the “en désastre” or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power
to disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles

of Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with
the intention of defeating creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Enforcement of security and security in insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed

to have capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey,
but to the extent that any floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is
expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or
domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid and
enforceable by the Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Insolvency Act 1986 (either
as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002) does
not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the
laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognize the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the

Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying
general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the
insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court think fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal
Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been
(and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the

company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of
the requesting country’s insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted

that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed as this is a matter for the
discretion of the Royal Court. The Royal Court’s position may also not be in accordance with
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”). Jersey does not form part of
the EU for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the Recast Insolvency
Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of center of
main interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by

bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general
application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an


-----

undervalue, preferences, extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and
fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the

provisions of Jersey law. The Jersey situs assets of H.I.J. Limited will be secured pursuant to Jersey
law governed security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may
enforce security over intangible movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or
proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke
enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the extent not in conflict with the 2012
Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement
options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The power
of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying
the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way
of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice.
Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale
and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement. The secured party is obliged on
sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any person who, 21 days
before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii) any
person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days
before the sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case,
the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing.

There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of sale. On exercising the

power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all commercially
reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral,
as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in
relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement
for or in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party
is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give
notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have agreed in writing to waive the notice
requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party appropriates or sells
collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give
certain persons (any person with a registered subordinate security interest and certain persons
claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of account setting out certain information
in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral
and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral exceeds the
amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any
resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who
has a subordinate security interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over
that security interest (where the registration remained effective immediately before the
appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given
the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of which
the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and
(iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured
party may discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into
the Royal Court. The surplus may then only be paid out on the order of the court on application by
a person entitled to the surplus.

**_Jersey limited partnerships_**

The Jersey law on limited partnerships is set out in Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1994,

as amended (the “Jersey **Limited Partnerships Law”) and a limited partnership established under**
the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law (excluding an incorporated limited partnership established
under the Incorporated Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 2011 and a separate limited partnership
established under the Separate Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 2011) is a “Jersey Limited
**Partnership”). Article 40 of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that the rules of**
customary law applicable to partnerships shall apply to Jersey Limited Partnerships except in so
far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law.
There is no Jersey equivalent to the UK Partnerships Act 1890 and so Jersey partnership law is
derived from the common or customary law applicable to general partnerships.

Although a Jersey Limited Partnership is registered with the Registrar of Limited

Partnerships in Jersey, the Jersey Limited Partnership is not a separate legal person nor a body
corporate. Therefore all actions and proceedings against a Jersey Limited Partnership must be
commenced against the general partner in its capacity as general partner of the Jersey Limited
Partnership, and not against any limited partner or against the Jersey Limited Partnership itself
(without reference to the general partner).

As a Jersey Limited Partnership is not a separate legal person, its insolvency (defined in

Article 2 of the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law as the general partner being unable to discharge
the debts of the Jersey Limited Partnership as they fall due out of the assets of the Jersey Limited
Partnership, without recourse to the general assets of the general partner) will not lead to the
commencement of _en désastre or creditors’ winding up proceedings in respect of the Jersey_
Limited Partnership. Please see paragraph below for a summary of the provisions of the Jersey
Limited Partnerships Law relating to dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership.

However, assuming the general partner is the sole general partner of the Jersey Limited

Partnership, given the unlimited liability of the general partner to meet the liabilities and
obligations of the Jersey Limited Partnership, the insolvency of the general partner (by way of en
_désastre or creditors’ winding up proceedings in respect of the general partner) will usually follow_
the insolvency of the Jersey Limited Partnership.

The Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that a Jersey Limited Partnership shall be

dissolved upon the dissolution, bankruptcy or withdrawal from the Jersey Limited Partnership of
the sole or last general partner (but not, subject to the provisions of the Jersey Limited Partnership
agreement, a limited partner). In such circumstances, the Jersey Limited Partnership shall be
wound up in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement or on the application
of a limited partner or a creditor of the Jersey Limited Partnership in accordance with the directions
of the Royal Court.

It should be noted that a Jersey Limited Partnership will not be wound up as referred to

above if within 90 days of its dissolution, the limited partners (either unanimously or as provided
for in the Jersey Limited Partnership agreement) elect one or more replacement general partners.
In such circumstances, the Limited Partnership shall be deemed to not have been dissolved and the


-----

activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership may be taken over and continued as provided for in the
limited partnership agreement or a subsequent agreement.

Under the Jersey Limited Partnerships Law, the Royal Court may order the dissolution of

a Jersey Limited Partnership on the application of any partner if the Royal Court is satisfied that:

(a) the Jersey Limited Partnership is being conducted in a manner calculated or likely to

affect prejudicially the carrying out of the activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership;

(b) the Jersey Limited Partnership is being conducted in a manner oppressive to one or

more of the limited partners; or

(c) circumstances have arisen which render it just and equitable that the Jersey Limited

Partnership be dissolved.

Where the Royal Court makes an order in accordance with this paragraph, it may give such

directions as it thinks fit as to the winding up of the Jersey Limited Partnership.

Upon the dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership, its affairs shall be wound up by the

general partner unless the activities of the Jersey Limited Partnership are taken over and continued
as referred to above or the Royal Court has given directions as to how the Jersey Limited
Partnership should be wound up.

The Jersey Limited Partnerships Law provides that the assets of a Limited Partnership shall

be distributed in the following order after the dissolution of a Jersey Limited Partnership:

(a) firstly, to the creditors (other than limited partners on account of their contribution or

profit and general partners) of the Jersey Limited Partnership in satisfaction of the
Jersey Limited Partnership’s debts;

(b) secondly, to limited partners who are creditors and who are not also general partners

in satisfaction of the Jersey Limited Partnership’s debts to them (other than debts
described in paragraph (c) below);

(c) finally, subject to the provisions of the limited partnership agreement, to the partners

as follows:

(i) firstly, to general partners other than for capital and profits;

(ii) secondly, to limited partners in respect of the capital of their contributions;

(iii) thirdly, to limited partners in respect of their share of the profits on their
contributions;

(iv) fourthly, to general partners in respect of capital; and

(v) finally, to general partners in respect of profits.


-----

The general insolvency and dissolution provisions under the Jersey Limited Partnerships

Law relating to Jersey Limited Partnerships established in Jersey are subject to a number of
specific exceptions.

**_Jersey guarantee limitations_**

The Indenture will provide that any right which at any time either Jersey Guarantor has

under the existing or future laws of Jersey, whether by virtue of the _droit de discussion or_
otherwise, to require that recourse be had to the assets of any other person before any claim is
enforced against such Jersey Guarantor, in respect of its obligations under the Indenture, will be
irrevocably and unconditionally abandoned and waived.

The Indenture will also provide that any right which at any time either Jersey Guarantor

may have under the existing or future laws of Jersey, whether by virtue of the droit de division or
otherwise, to require that any liability under the Indenture be divided or apportioned with any other
person or reduced in any manner whatsoever will be irrevocably and unconditionally abandoned
and waived.

**Guernsey**

**_Commercial Benefit_**

Under Guernsey law, a Guarantee or the provision of security may be liable to be set aside

if there is no commercial benefit to the Guarantor in issuing it. The directors of each Guarantor
organized in Guernsey (each, a “Guernsey Guarantor”) believe that the issuance of the
Guarantees and the provision of security by a Guernsey Guarantor are of commercial benefit to
such Guarantor. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Guarantees or the
provision of security will not be challenged by a liquidator, administrator or creditor, or that a
court would support the directors’ commercial benefit analysis.

**_Customary Law_**

Under Guernsey customary law, if it can be shown that the granting of a Guarantee or the

provision of security was made at the time the Guarantor was insolvent or that the Guarantor
became insolvent as a result of the Guarantee or the provision of security, any person prejudiced
by the Guarantee or the provision of security may apply to the Guernsey Court to set the Guarantee
or the security aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision of Guernsey customary
law may, in certain circumstances, be used by any person who claims to be the victim of the
transaction, not only liquidators. If a court were to find that the granting of the Guarantee or the
provision of security constituted a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such
orders as it thinks fit to protect the interests of those creditors and to restore the Guarantor’s
position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into, including by
voiding the Guarantee and/or the security. There is not yet decisive case law as to what, if any,
time limit there is on such a challenge. Furthermore, if the Guernsey Court was asked to enforce a
Guarantee or security against a Guernsey Guarantor, that Guernsey Guarantor might be able to
claim certain rights under Guernsey law, known as the “droit de division” and the “droit de
_discussion,” being respectively a right to require that any liability of the Guernsey Guarantor be_
divided or apportioned with another person or persons and a right to require that the assets of the


-----

principal obligor (or any other person) be exhausted before any claim is enforced against the
Guernsey Guarantor unless the Guernsey Guarantor has agreed to waive such rights. It is intended
that the Guernsey Guarantor will waive its rights under the _droit de division_ and the _droit de_
_discussion under the Indenture._

**_Fraudulent and Wrongful Trading_**

Under Guernsey law, if the business of a company is carried on with intent to defraud

creditors (whether of the company or of any other person) or for any fraudulent purpose, every
person who is knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner is guilty of an
offense. Civil liability can also arise where in the course of the winding up of a company it appears
that the business of the company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors (whether of
the company or of any other person) or for any fraudulent purpose. In that instance the Guernsey
Court on application of a creditor, member, liquidator or administrator may declare that any person
who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in such manner is liable to make a
contribution to the company’s assets.

If in the course of an insolvent winding up of a Guernsey company it appears that at some

time before the commencement of the winding up a director (including an alternate, de facto or
shadow director) knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the
company avoiding going into insolvent liquidation, the Guernsey Court on the application of the
liquidator or any creditor or member of the company can declare that such director shall be liable
to make such contribution to the company’s assets as the Guernsey Court thinks proper, unless
upon the insolvent winding up becoming inevitable such director took every step to minimize
potential loss to the company’s creditors, which that director ought reasonably to have taken,
taking into account the skills expected of a person carrying on such functions carried out by that
director and the actual knowledge, skill and experience of that director.

**_Preferences_**

In Guernsey, if a liquidator can show that a company has given a “preference” to any person

after the commencement of a period of six months immediately preceding the start of the winding
up proceedings (or two years if the preference is to a connected person) and at the time of giving
the preference such company was unable to pay its debts or became as a result of giving the
preference unable to pay its debts, the Guernsey Court may make such order as it thinks fit for
restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given the preference. A
company is deemed to have given a preference to a person if that person is either one of the
company’s creditors or a surety or Guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities, and the
company does anything or permits anything to be done which improves that person’s position in
the company’s liquidation. The Guernsey Court may not make an order regarding a preferential
transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference
by a desire to put that person in a better position in the company’s liquidation, save where the
person given a preference is connected with the company where such desire is presumed unless
the contrary is shown. If the Guernsey Court finds that the Guarantees are preferences, it has wide
powers for restoring the position of the Guarantor to what it would have been if that preference
had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the Guarantees or setting aside


-----

the Guarantees and any security provided. However, there is protection for a third party who enters
into a preferential transaction in good faith, for value and without notice.

**_Choice of Law_**

Under Guernsey law, parties may choose the laws of a foreign jurisdiction as the governing

law of a Guarantee so long as that choice is legal and bona fide. Under the Indenture, the Issuer
and the Guernsey Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York. A
judgment of a New York court should be enforceable in Guernsey in accordance with the common
law rules of private international law relating to the enforcement of foreign judgments, subject to
certain qualifications more specifically set out in the section “Service of Process and Enforcement
_of Civil Liabilities.”_

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under Guernsey law there are two substantive types of insolvency proceedings relating to

non-cellular companies, namely administration and winding up proceedings although there are
also the customary law insolvency procedures of désastre and saisie. Désastre involves execution
against a debtor’s movable assets in Guernsey and is most often employed against individuals, but
could potentially be applied to companies. Saisie involves execution against a debtor’s real
property situated in Guernsey.

_Administration_

An administration order may be made in respect of a Guernsey company if the Guernsey

Court is satisfied that a company does not satisfy or is likely to become unable to satisfy the
“solvency test” prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended and considers
that the making of an administration order may achieve either:

    - the survival of the company, and the whole or any part of its undertaking, as a going

concern; or

    - a more advantageous realization of the company’s assets than would be effected on a

winding up.

An administration order may be applied for by a company itself, the directors of the

company, any member of the company, any creditor of the company (including any prospective or
contingent creditor), the GFSC in respect of supervised companies and companies engaged in
financial services business or, in the case of a company in respect of which the Guernsey Court
has made an order for winding up or which has passed a resolution for voluntary winding up, a
liquidator.

In the period between the presentation of the application for an administration order and

ending with the making of an order or the dismissal of the application:

    - no resolution may be passed or order made for the company’s winding up; and


-----

    - no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company except with the

leave of the Guernsey Court and subject to such terms and conditions as the Guernsey
Court may impose.

However, a creditor’s rights of set-off and security interests created pursuant to the Security

Interests (Guernsey) Law, 1993 and rights of enforcement thereof are unaffected and may be
exercised without the leave of the Guernsey Court. In addition, the leave of the Guernsey Court is
not required for the presentation of an application for the company’s winding up in that period.

Following the making of an administration order and during the period for which the

administration order is in force, the affairs, business and property of a company are managed by
an administrator appointed by the Guernsey Court, and no resolution may be passed or order made
for the company’s winding up and no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the
company except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the Guernsey Court and
subject to such terms and conditions as the Guernsey Court may impose. However, a creditor’s
rights of setoff and security interests created pursuant to the Security Interests (Guernsey) Law,
1993, and rights of enforcement thereof are unaffected.

_Winding up_

A Guernsey company may be wound up voluntarily if:

    - the period (if any) fixed by its memorandum or articles of incorporation for the duration

of the company expires, provided that the company passes an ordinary resolution that
it be wound up voluntarily; or

    - an event (if any) occurs on the occurrence of which the memorandum or articles of

incorporation of the company provide that the company must be dissolved, provided
that the company passes an ordinary resolution that it be wound up voluntarily; or

    - if the company passes a special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily.

From the commencement of a voluntary winding up (which occurs upon the passing of the

resolution for voluntary winding up), the company must cease to carry on business, except insofar
as may be expedient for the beneficial winding up of the company. The company, however,
continues in existence until dissolution.

Arrangements can be entered into between a Guernsey company which is being voluntarily

wound up and its creditors to delegate to its creditors the right to appoint a liquidator. Any
arrangement entered into between a company and its creditors, subject to a right of appeal, is
binding if sanctioned by a special resolution of the company and by 75% in number and value of
its creditors. However, a creditor or shareholder of a company that has entered into such an
arrangement may, within 21 days beginning on the date of the completion of the arrangement,
apply to the Guernsey Court for an order that the arrangement be set aside. The Guernsey Court
may make such order as it thinks fit for the setting aside, amendment, variation or confirmation of
the arrangement.


-----

A company may be compulsorily wound up by the Guernsey Court if the company, among

others: has by special resolution resolved that it be wound up by the Guernsey Court; has not
commenced business within one year beginning on the date of its incorporation; suspends business
for a whole year; has no members; or is unable to pay its debts. For this purpose, a company is
deemed to be unable to pay its debts if a creditor to whom the company owes a sum exceeding
£750, which is due, serves on the company through the office of H.M. Sergeant at the company’s
registered office a written demand for payment (commonly called a “statutory demand”), and the
company, for a period of 21 days immediately following the date of service of the statutory
demand, fails to pay the sum or to secure payment to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; or
if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Guernsey Court that the company fails to satisfy the solvency
test as prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended.

On the making of an application for the compulsory winding up of a company or at any

time thereafter, any creditor of the company may apply to the Guernsey Court for an order
restraining, on such terms and conditions as the Guernsey Court thinks fit, any action or proceeding
pending against the company; or appointing a provisional liquidator to ascertain the company’s
assets and liabilities, manage its affairs and do all acts authorized by the Guernsey Court.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency_**

Where a company has its “center of main interests” or an “establishment” in the

Netherlands it may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency
laws, subject to certain exceptions provided for in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended.
Certain of the Guarantors have their corporate seat in the Netherlands (i.e., the Dutch Guarantors)
and it is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) that they have their “center of main
interests” in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of
certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to debtors

(excluding natural persons). The first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is
intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to
continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to
liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency
regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, bankruptcy
proceedings may also be used to sell the business, or parts of the business, as a going concern. As
such, a bankruptcy could function as a restructuring procedure as well as a liquidation procedure.
A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. Furthermore,
as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility under a pre-insolvency regime plan to offer a
composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings, see further under “—Dutch Scheme”
below.

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Once

the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, the court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a


-----

provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is
required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the
composition be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium is made. If the
composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by the court (gehomologeerd), the
provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a
qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the
creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’
meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The moratorium of
payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11
proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under
Dutch law, secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may
enforce their rights against assets of the debtor in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims
as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve
a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may
order a “cooling down period” for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement
actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Further, in a definitive moratorium of
payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding on
all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the creditors
being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of
the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd)
by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the
holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in
Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings to the extent that the proceeds of the Dutch law
security created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes are insufficient to satisfy their claims.
Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot
be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it is no longer able to pay its

debts when due. The bankruptcy can be requested by the debtor itself or a creditor whose claim is
due and payable but left unpaid; provided that there is at least one other eligible creditor or, in
exceptional circumstances (e.g., for reasons of public interest), by the public prosecutor.

If the court declares a debtor bankrupt, it will appoint a receiver (curator) (or several

receivers, depending on the complexity of the proceedings) and a judge to supervise the insolvency
proceedings. The receiver will realize the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the debtor’s
creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment. The general principle of Dutch
bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means
that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings
shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such as
secured creditors and preferential creditors, including tax and social security authorities) will have
special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. As a general rule, claims of
unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to
be verified. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the debtor’s shareholders. Creditors of
secured claims, such as the holders of the Notes, and preferential creditors with respect to certain
assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets subject


-----

to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim
in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with
respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or
preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset to which the relevant preferential
right relates. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for
submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy
its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in
order to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver in bankruptcy
determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the
bankruptcy proceedings for the purpose of distribution of the proceeds. A claim with an uncertain
due date or which entitles the creditor to periodic payments shall be admitted for its value at the
date of the bankruptcy order. Claims which become payable within one year after the day the
debtor is declared bankrupt shall be considered matured. Claims which become payable one year
after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings shall be admitted for their value one year from
the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy. Claims having an indeterminate or uncertain
value, or whose value is not expressed in Dutch currency or not expressed in monetary terms at
all, shall be admitted for their estimated value in Dutch currency. Interest payments on claims
existing at the time of the bankruptcy order that fall due after such time cannot be verified, unless
secured by a pledge or mortgage. In such a case, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the
extent that the interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive
any rights from the admission. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the
holders of the Notes may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a
creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the insolvent debtor and
all verified creditors may dispute the verification of any other claim that has been submitted for
verification. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be
referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). As in moratorium of payments
proceedings, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on
unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the creditors being
present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the
claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the
court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors.
Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are
distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination may, to a certain extent, be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However,
the actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, may enforce their rights against assets

of the debtor that are subject to the security to satisfy their claims during a Dutch bankruptcy as if
there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the court may order a “cooling
down period” for a maximum of four months during which all recourse actions (including action
to enforce security) by secured creditors (other than estate creditors (boedelschuldeisers)), are
prohibited unless such creditors have obtained leave from the supervisory judge. Further, a receiver
in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period
of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets. Failing enforcement
before such deadline, the receiver is permitted to sell the secured asset. After such a sale, the former
holder of the security right remains entitled to a prioritized claim, but the underlying assets are no
longer available for immediate recourse and the secured creditor will need to contribute to the


-----

general costs of the bankruptcy to be paid out of the proceeds realized by such a sale by the
liquidator. If the proceeds of sale are insufficient to repay the debt owed to the secured creditor,
the secured creditor will be treated as an unsecured creditor for the balance of its residual claims.
Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be setoff (verrekend) against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. Such set-off
is allowed prior to the bankruptcy although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.
Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy
proceedings.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of

judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets, will be terminated
by operation of law. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

In addition, under Dutch insolvency laws, the validity of an appointment of an agent for

service of process granted by a Dutch company is uncertain. Furthermore, such appointments will
terminate automatically in the case of an insolvency of the Dutch Guarantor. As such, the ability
to bring suit against the Dutch Guarantor in the United States may be limited.

**_Dutch Scheme_**

As regards the pre-insolvency plan regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the

possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act
**on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans”). The pre-insolvency plan**
regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant to this Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a composition in suspension of
payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The
Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class
cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, deactivation of certain _ipso facto_ clauses in
contracts, and supporting court measures. The debtor and also creditors, shareholders or employee
representation may take the initiative for a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Such composition may result in claims against the Dutch
Guarantors as compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior
class vote in favor of such a composition and such composition is confirmed by Dutch courts. A
composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can
extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing
outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans can affect the rights of the Security Agent and/or the holders of the Notes
under the Indenture.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, voting on a

composition plan is done in classes and creditors and shareholders with dissimilar
rights are placed in different classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a
majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class


-----

of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition
plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court
Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at
least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a
distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory
ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis
of (i) certain general grounds for refusal (e.g. procedural requirements have not been met, fraud,
etc.), (ii) a request by an affected non-consenting creditor of a consenting class if the value of the
distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be
expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (iii) a request of an affected creditor
of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the
statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a
reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to
secured financial creditors that have provided financing to the debtor (if so requested by such
creditor(s)). If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not
want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a

different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such
creditor.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may

grant a stay on enforcement (afkoelingsperiode) of a maximum of four months, with a possible
extension of four months. During such stay on enforcement period, _inter alia, all enforcement_
action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to
enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims
may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge, unless with
the court’s approval. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are
suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or
restructuring expert.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

Security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court if the relevant security document

was executed or the security was otherwise provided through undue influence (misbruik van
_omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the_
agreement contained in that document. Additionally, enforcement of the security interests over
shares of capital stock of the Dutch Guarantors may be subject to the requirement to seek a
declaration of no-objection from the ECB.

Payment under a security document governed by Dutch law may be withheld, and the

exercise of rights in respect of the security or the enforcement of the security interest may be
limited, under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force
majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming), and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden) and other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the_
validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. Other impeding factors include
rights of suspension (opschorting), dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening).
The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantors may also be limited under the 1977


-----

Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a
Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, such court may mitigate amounts
due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

Furthermore, if a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a

guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be
contested by the Dutch company or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments
or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy, if (i) that transaction is not in the company’s corporate
interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have
known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee
or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not
only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also
all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits
from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any
indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence
of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the
relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain
legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of
association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the
corporate interests.

**_Parallel debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether “accessory” security interests such as pledges

require that the pledgee and the creditor of the obligations to be secured be the same person. It is
often assumed that such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold
the secured claim. The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the
security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have the
benefit of a secured claim, the security documents will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.”
Pursuant to the parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount
payable by an obligor under the Notes. The security governed by Dutch law will directly secure
the parallel debt. The parallel debt procedure has not been (explicitly) tested under Dutch law, and
there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch
law.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent conveyance_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without

limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it agrees to provide or provides security for any of its
or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security
and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or
otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its receiver in bankruptcy, if (i) it
performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor
concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the
act, and at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om
_niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its_
creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy,


-----

their receiver in bankruptcy may nullify its performance of any due and payable obligation
(including, without limitation, an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s
obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been
filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of concerted
efforts by the debtor and the payee with a view to giving preference to the latter over the debtor’s
other creditors.

For certain types of transactions that are entered into within one year before (a) the

declaration of the bankruptcy, or (b) the moment the transaction is challenged by a creditor, the
debtor and the counterparty to the transaction are legally presumed to have knowledge of the fact
that the transaction will prejudice the debtor’s creditors (subject to evidence of the contrary).

**Portugal**

**_Insolvency_**

International aspects of Portuguese bankruptcy, controlled management or voluntary

arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as
amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”). Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court
which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court
of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main
interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a
question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even
conflicting views. Certain of the Guarantors have their corporate seat in Portugal (i.e., Whitestar
Asset Solutions, S.A. and AGHL Portugal Investments Holdings, S.A. (the “Portuguese
**Guarantors”), which are incorporated under Portuguese law and have their registered offices in**
Portugal) and it is therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) that they have their “center
of main interests” in Portugal. Portuguese insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your
investments as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief
description of certain aspects of Portuguese insolvency law.

Insolvency proceedings in Portugal may be initiated either by the debtor, a creditor or the

Public Prosecutor (Ministerio Público) (representing entities which have their interests legally
entrusted to it) when the debtor is deemed to be insolvent. Under Portuguese insolvency law, a
debtor is deemed to be insolvent if it is unable to fulfill its debts as they fall due. A company will
also be considered insolvent if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the
company’s assets is significantly lower than the amount of its liabilities, according to the relevant
accounting principles. Furthermore, although the main rule under Portuguese law is that
insolvency is assessed on the existing factual situation, should the directors determine that the
company will become insolvent in the near future, they can file for insolvency.

Furthermore, the Portuguese Code on Insolvency and Recovery of Companies (CIRE)

establishes that when facing a difficult economic situation or in the case of a merely imminent
insolvency situation, the debtor may submit an application to court for a special proceeding of
revitalization (PER). Additionally, the companies facing economic difficulties may also make use
of the “Extrajudicial Regime of Companies´ Recovery” (“RERE”). This is an out-of-court process


-----

managed by the Commercial Registry that aims at improving the conditions for reorganization of
companies in deteriorated economic/financial structure still having the potential of being
recovered. Finally, “Extraordinary Companies’ Viability Proceeding” (“PEVE”) is a temporary
scheme created for businesses in financial difficulties and/or insolvent because of the economic
and financial consequences of COVID-19. It is expected to remain in force until December 2021.

**_Insolvency filing_**

The debtor must file for insolvency within 30 days of the date on which it becomes aware,

or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. If the debtor fails to do so, it may be
declared by a Portuguese court to be in a state of “guilty insolvency” (insolvência culposa), which
may lead to civil sanctions being imposed on the debtor (if an individual) and/or its administrators,
such as the inhibition of performance of acts of commerce for a period ranging from two to ten
years, the prohibition for its administrators to be appointed to the board of corporate entities, the
loss of credits over the insolvency or over the insolvent estate, the obligation to restore assets or
rights received as a payment for those credits and the obligation to pay a compensation to the
debtor’s creditors up to the amount of the unsatisfied claims (all claims that were not paid in full
in the insolvency proceedings) up to the limit of the debtor’s administrators available assets, and
also to criminal sanctions, such as a fine or imprisonment of up to a year or five years if the debtor
had the intent to cause damages to its creditors. Currently, companies are not obliged to file for
insolvency within the typical timeframe. The applicable deadlines have been suspended and this
is expected to last as long as the exceptional and temporary measures in response to the COVID19 pandemic remain in place.

**_The creditor’s insolvency claim_**

Upon the occurrence of certain events, any creditor is entitled, regardless of the nature of

the debt owed to it, to file an insolvency claim against the debtor, even if such debt has not yet
fallen due. A creditor must provide evidence of the existence, nature, origin and amount of the
debt owed to it and it can do so by means of any type of evidence provided for in Portuguese law,
notably the testimony of witnesses and presentation of documents. Such events include a general
suspension of payment of overdue obligations of the debtor, the default on one or more debts
which, considering the amount of such debt or the circumstances of such default, reveals that the
debtor is generally unable to fulfill its obligations, the dissipation, renunciation or hasty liquidation
of debtor’s assets, the fraudulent assumption of debt or the general default, during a prior period
of six months, on certain tax, social security contribution and employment obligations.

**_Effects of the declaration of insolvency_**

When a debtor is declared insolvent by the court, an “insolvency administrator”

(administrador de insolvência) is appointed and the administration of the debtor’s assets is
immediately transferred to the insolvency administrator. In some cases, Portuguese law allows the
debtor’s corporate bodies to maintain their management activities, subject, however, to the
supervision and powers of the insolvency administrator. The insolvency estate encompasses all
assets belonging to the debtor at the time the insolvency is declared. In addition, all the assets that
the insolvent debtor acquires during the insolvency proceedings also form part of the insolvency
estate. If a court declares a debtor to be insolvent, the judge orders the apprehension, for immediate


-----

delivery to the insolvency administrator, of all of the assets of the debtor, even if seized, secured,
mortgaged or by any means apprehended. Once insolvency is declared, the claims over the
insolvent entity become immediately due, except if subject to conditions precedent, in which case
specific rules will apply.

**_Effects of the insolvency on executory contracts_**

As a rule, executory contracts (a contract in which continuing obligations exist on both

sides of the contract) shall be suspended when insolvency is determined (standstill effect) and,
depending on the decision of the insolvency administrator, may be performed or terminated. A
decision by the insolvency administrator that an executory contract should be performed rather
than terminated is deemed to be abusive in situations where timely performance of the contractual
obligations by the insolvency estate is highly unlikely. Specific rules govern the effects of
insolvency on certain types of contracts.

**_Set aside (resolução) for the benefit of the insolvency estate_**

The insolvency administrator has the power to set aside certain acts, omissions or

agreements entered into by the insolvent company. Past acts or omissions that are considered
detrimental to the insolvency estate may be set aside if entered into by the insolvent company
within two years prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. Acts that reduce,
prevent, render more difficult, jeopardize or delay the payment of creditors are considered
detrimental to the insolvency estate. The ability of the insolvency administrator to set aside acts or
omissions generally requires bad faith on the part of the third party affected thereby. Bad faith is
presumed in the case of acts or omissions made within two years prior to the commencement of
the insolvency proceedings by, or for the benefit of, a related party of the insolvent company (even
if such beneficiary was not a related party at the time of the act or omission). Certain events can
be set aside for the benefit of the insolvency estate, without proving bad faith or the detrimental
nature of the act or omission.

**_Rules on priority of credits_**

Under the CIRE, creditors’ claims are divided into guaranteed, privileged, ordinary and

subordinated claims. Portuguese law also recognizes “insolvency estate debts” (dívidas da massa
_insolvente), which must be settled in priority to all other claims. Such claims include the judicial_
costs of the insolvency proceedings, the insolvency administrator’s remuneration, debts arising
from administration acts, liquidation and division of assets and, under certain circumstances, debts
arising from the performance of executory agreements. The claims accepted by the insolvency
administrator and recognized by the court are paid according to a ranking, depending on the type
of assets to be sold under the scope of the insolvency proceedings.

**_Liquidation of the insolvency estate or insolvency plan_**

The CIRE determines that creditors’ claims may be satisfied by either a liquidation of the

insolvency estate or by putting in place a company rescue pursuant to an insolvency plan. This
decision is to be made solely by the creditors. In the case of liquidation of a debtor’s insolvency
estate, the debtor’s assets will be sold and the amounts recovered from the proceeds of such sale
will be, at a first stage, allocated to the “insolvency estate debts” (dívidas da massa insolvente)


-----

and thereafter to the payment of the credits accepted by the insolvency administrator and
recognized by the court. An insolvency plan is a rescue mechanism which can be put in place as
an alternative to the liquidation process.

**_Special Proceedings of Revitalization_**

The PER is an urgent proceeding intended to allow the debtor that finds itself in a difficult

economic situation or in a merely imminent insolvency situation, but is still likely to recover from
that status, to negotiate with its creditors in order to enter into an agreement with them leading to
its recovery. For this purpose, the debtor is considered to be in a difficult economic situation if it
faces serious difficulties to comply promptly with its obligations due to lack of liquidity or not
being able to obtain credit. Moreover, the debtor is in a merely imminent insolvency situation if it
anticipates that it shall not be able to continue to comply promptly with its obligations, which
means that it shall not be able to resort to this process if it is already in an actual insolvency
situation. The PER begins with an expression of intent by the debtor and of at least one of its
creditors, by means of a written statement, to enter into negotiations leading to the revitalization
of the debtor through the adoption of a recovery plan. At the same time the debtor should also
submit documents to the court which should immediately appoint a provisional judicial
administrator. It is not required that all creditors participate in the negotiations. However, once
the plan has been approved and confirmed by the judge, it will bind all creditors, whether or not
they have participated in the negotiations. Under the COVID-19 legislation measures, creditors
(partners) who finance the debtor’s activity by providing capital for its revitalization have a general
moveable credit privilege, ranked ahead of the general moveable credit privilege granted to
employees.

**_Extrajudicial Regime of Companies’ Recovery (RERE)_**

The company which intends to apply to the RERE shall sign a negotiation protocol and

promote their deposit at the Commercial Registry Office. This protocol must be signed by the
debtor and the creditors representing at least 15% of non-subordinated claims and shall include a
change in the composition, conditions or structure of the debtor’s liabilities and/or assets, including
share capital, or a combination of these elements, including the sale of assets or parts of activity,
with the objective of the company surviving, in whole or in part. It should be noted that this
protocol does not need to be voted on. Each creditor favors the protocol only if it accepts the
restructuring of its credit. Thus, any agreement that may be approved will only take effect for
creditors who have joined the RERE and who have approved the negotiation protocol.

Exceptionally, while the COVID-19 measures are in force, insolvent companies may resort

to the RERE provided that: (i) the current situation of insolvency is due to the COVID-19
pandemic, (ii) the company is susceptible to viability and (iii) it demonstrates that as of December
31, 2019, it had an asset greater than a liability, calculated based on the applicable accounting
standards.

As a result of the approval of the negotiation protocol, the pledges and the executive

measures promoted by the creditors who joined the RERE and who signed the negotiation protocol
are suspended; pledges and executive actions by creditors who have not joined the RERE remain
active. Also, the providers of essential services such as electricity, natural gas, water and


-----

telecommunications are unable to suspend their supply for non-payment for the entire duration of
the negotiation.

“Extraordinary Company Viability Process” (“PEVE”)

A PEVE begins with the presentation by the company, through a lawyer, to the competent

court, of an initial application with a written statement signed by the company’s management body
(managers in private limited companies and single-member limited companies, board of directors
or sole director in public limited companies) attesting that its situation is due to the COVID-19
pandemic. For the process to be activated, a viability agreement, signed by the company and the
majority of the creditors, must also be presented.

A list is also required, prepared in alphabetical order, with all the creditors, their addresses,

the value of the claims, due dates and the nature and guarantees they benefit from. This list must
have been prepared within the last 30 days and must be signed by the company’s management and
by a certified accountant or statutory auditor.

A PEVE does not involve the payment of any procedural fee. The company will be

responsible for payment of the remuneration of the provisional judicial administrator, but the
company will benefit from the protection of internal financing (which enjoys a general securities
credit privilege, thus escaping its classification as a subordinated credit) and tax advantages
(reduction or forgiveness of interest) associated with any plans accepted by the tax authority or
social security.

After the appointment of the provisional judicial administrator and until the judgment

(ratification or non-ratification of the agreement) has become final, no actions may be filed
claiming the payment of debts.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Portuguese law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance,

irrespective of whether the debtor has been declared insolvent (Impugnação Pauliana). The
Portuguese Civil Code offers creditors protection against the acts of the debtor which led to a
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a
third party or agrees to provide, or provides security for any of its obligations or a third party’s
obligations or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged by any of the debtor’s
creditors if: (i) the contested act has occurred after the creation of the credit (or before, if such act
was performed with the intention to damage the creditor’s means of recovery); (ii) the contested
act makes the recovery of the credit impossible or frustrates such recovery; and (iii) at the time the
act was performed both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have
known that the act would be detrimental to the creditor, unless the act was entered into for no
consideration, in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful
challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

Under the Portuguese Civil Code, a creditor may file a paulian action within a period of

five years as from the date on which the contested act took place. A creditor that successfully
challenges a debtor under such action, could have security governed by Portuguese law voided by


-----

a court. These provisions from the Portuguese Civil Code are still enforceable in case of insolvency
of the debtor. If a court considers that the issuance of the Collateral issued by the Portuguese
Guarantors involved a fraudulent conveyance that does not qualify for any defense under
applicable law, then the issuance of such Collateral could be declared unenforceable against third
parties or the creditor that lodged the claim.

**Independent Review Report to Arrow Global Group PLC**

**Conclusion**

We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly
financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2021 which comprises the condensed consolidated statement of
profit or loss and other comprehensive income, condensed consolidated statement of financial position,
condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity, condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and the
related explanatory notes.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2021 is not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK and the Disclosure
Guidance and Transparency Rules (“the DTR”) of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (“the UK FCA”).

**Scope of review**

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland)
2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the
Auditing Practices Board for use in the UK. A review of interim financial information consists of making
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and
other review procedures. We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and consider
whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed
set of financial statements.

A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**Directors’ responsibilities**

The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are
responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the DTR of the UK FCA.

As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European
Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted
international accounting standards. The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of financial
statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted for use in the UK.

**Our responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the
half-yearly financial report based on our review.

**The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the
Company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA. Our review has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company
for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

Note – There has been a reclassification between the two operating expense rows ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ and ‘other
operating expenses’ in the prior period. This change was made to better reflect the evolved nature of the Group’s business model and
presenting direct costs of the Group’s business lines is deemed to provide more relevant information. As such, we have reclassified
£13,895,000 from ‘other operating expenses’ to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ in the prior period. The total impact is £nil.
Further information can be found in note 8. This adjustment is in line with that made in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1. General Information**

The Company is incorporated in England and Wales. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements
(interim financial statements) of the Company as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2021 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’). The Group’s principal activity is to identify,
acquire and manage secured and unsecured non-performing and non-core loan portfolios and real estate from and
on behalf of financial institutions, such as banks, institutional fund investors and specialist lenders.

**2. Basis of preparation**

These interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as
adopted for use in the UK. They do not include all the information required for full annual financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year
ended 31 December 2020.

The annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted pursuant to
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU. As required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the interim financial statements have been prepared applying the
accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Company’s published
consolidated annual report for the year ended 31 December 2020.

The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 are not the complete version of the
Company’s statutory accounts for that financial year. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at
and for the year ended 31 December 2020 are available upon request from the Company’s registered office at
Belvedere, 12 Booth Street, Manchester, M2 4AW or online at www.arrowglobalir.net. Those accounts have
been reported on by the Company’s auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditor:

(i) was unqualified;

(ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying their report; and

(iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

The interim financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than
the fair value of derivative contracts and certain portfolio investments and the amortised cost accounting for other
financial assets and liabilities.

These interim financial statements were approved by the board of directors on 12 August 2021.

**Going concern**

In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate to adopt for the Group as at 30 June 2021, the
directors have undertaken a thorough review of the latest forecast cash flow models and scenarios for a period in
excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts, with the primary focus of detailed forecasting
running to the end of 2022.

A base case forecast and several downside scenarios have been prepared reflecting the Group’s current financial
position and expected future performance. Key items considered within each forecast were the future outlook for
HPI and unemployment, including the length and severity of any potential macroeconomic shock, and the impact
these may have on the Group’s cash flows. These cash flows were considered against the Group’s future liquidity
position, taking into account that there are no bond maturities until 2024. Adherence to the Group’s liquidity,
leverage and ERC loan to value covenants was also considered in all scenarios.

The results of this scenario analysis show that even in a severe but plausible downside scenario, after taking
reasonable management actions (such as cost reductions, slowing purchases and collection acceleration) as
required, the Group is able to maintain sufficient liquidity and cash reserves to operate within banking covenants,
and to continue as a going concern. This scenario was aligned to the severe downside forecasts outlined in note 10.

**2. Basis of preparation (continued)**

Finally, a reverse stress test has also been prepared, incorporating a plausible set of management actions, to
identify the magnitude of a downside stress that needs to occur to cause the group to breach its financial
covenants. It has been concluded that this represents an overly severe and implausible scenario. The directors
note the proposed acquisition by Sherwood Acquisitions Limited (a newly formed company owned by
investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP) (“Bidco”) to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share
capital of the Parent Company and, in particular, the statements that Bidco has made in the Offer Documents
regarding its intentions for the Group if that acquisition completes. In accordance with the Takeover Code, the
Directors only have access to this publicly available information.

The directors considered the impact of the proposed acquisition in the Group’s going concern assessment. They
note that should the acquisition complete, Bidco’s stated intentions do not depart significantly from the Group’s
existing strategy or present causes for concern that completion of the acquisition by Bidco would have an adverse
effect on the ability of the Group and Parent Company to continue as a going concern. Based on all of the above
indicators, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern
basis.

**3. Adoption of new standards**

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2021, which are deemed not to have a material impact on the results of the Group.

**4. Accounting policies, critical accounting judgements and estimates**

In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management have made judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

In preparing the interim financial statements, the accounting policies, areas of judgement, estimation and
assumption were the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2020.

1 In line with the requirements of IFRS 8:29, due to the change of the segmental reporting structure aligned to the Group now being
managed through an integrated asset manager model, the corresponding information for 2020 has also been restated. This is done on the
same basis as in the Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2020.
2 The split of total operating expenses has changed from the Interim results 30 June 2020, with a reclass between ‘collection activity and
fund management costs’ and ‘other operating expenses’, as part of the change in the segmental reporting structure aligned to the Group
now being managed through an integrated asset management model. The total operating expenses impact is £nil. The main movements
between the categorisation relate to allocation of internal staff costs and professional fees. This re-presented is on the same basis as done
in the Annual Report and Accounts 31 December 2020.

Other operating expense inclusive of depreciation, amortisation and forex totals £48,104,000 (H1 2020: £48,040,000).

**7. Taxation charge on ordinary activities**

The taxation charge for the period was £1,375,000 (H1 2020: £25,509,000 credit). The taxation before takeover
cost impacts was £2,296,000 with an effective consolidated tax rate for the six months ended 30 June 2021 was
10.0% (30 June 2020: (18.8)%). The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, which are subject to different
corporate tax rates during the interim period. The Group has therefore calculated an estimated average annual
effective tax rate for each jurisdiction, based on forecast profits and substantially enacted corporate tax rates
relevant to those jurisdictions, to determine the Group’s consolidated effective tax rate.

Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the tax losses and
temporary timing differences are expected to reverse. At Budget 2021, the government announced an increase to
the rate of UK corporation tax for the year starting 1 April 2023, setting the rate at 25% which was passed in the
Finance Act 2021 on 10 June 2021. A credit of £3,728,000 has been recorded to the profit and loss to reflect the
restatement of the UK deferred tax asset.

**Scenario modelling information**

To assist with the understanding of how the Group has modelled the future cash flows which ultimately drive the
valuation of the portfolio investment assets, the below table shows the probability that has been assigned to each
macroeconomic scenario when preparing the cash flow forecasts.

The key macroeconomic indicator for each segment is the level of unemployment for unsecured and HPI for
secured. These metrics are monitored at a national level with unemployment being the national unemployment
rate, and HPI the relevant index of house prices used to observe the relative change in house prices in each
country. The corresponding forecasts for unemployment and HPI are detailed on the following pages.
Unemployment represents the expected year-end unemployment rate under the different scenarios relative to
Base and HPI, the expected year-end growth rate under the different scenarios relative to Base.

In addition to these metrics, we also consider the impact of inflation and household indebtedness to provide
additional context regarding macroeconomic conditions, albeit we consider these factors to have a less significant
impact on performance.

When calculating the probability-weighted average for each country and asset class, the secured Base ERCs have
been determined to most closely align to the ‘Stagnation’ macroeconomic scenarios. The forecasting
methodology utilised for production of the unsecured Base ERCs, namely simulation methods, have an
underlying assumption of a static macroeconomic environment, reflecting economic uncertainty rather than the
anticipated macroeconomic improvements. To that end, the Group note that the unsecured Base ERCs have been
produced using assumptions which are in the range between ‘Stagnation’ and ‘Base’ macroeconomic scenarios.

Application of the probability-weighted average on this basis indicates an anticipated increase in the Base ERCs
as a result of future macroeconomic scenarios. However, given the continuing relative macroeconomic
uncertainty, no macroeconomic adjustment (increase) has been applied to the Base ERCs.

The directors consider that the carrying amounts of the current trade and other payables approximate to their fair
value on the basis that the balances are short term in nature. The contingent element of the non-current deferred
consideration has also been calculated at fair value.

**Senior secured notes**

The senior secured notes comprise three publicly issued Euro and Sterling senior notes secured by substantially
all of the assets of the Group; £320 million 5.125% fixed-rate notes due September 2024, €400 million floating
rate senior secured notes due April 2025 at a coupon of 3.75% over three-month Euribor and €360 million
floating rate senior secured notes, including the €75 million tap, due March 2026 at a coupon of 3.75% over
three-month Euribor. The Euro notes are subject to a zero percent floor on Euribor.

On 12 February 2021, Arrow Global Finance plc issued €75 million senior secured notes maturing 2026, at an
issue price of 99%. This tap issue of the existing €285 million senior secured floating rate bonds due 2026 means
that all terms and conditions of the new bonds are identical to those of the existing 2026 bonds, except for the
issue price. The proceeds from the transaction of €74,250,000 less transaction fees and expenses were used to
partially repay drawings under the Group’s revolving credit facility.

**Revolving credit facility**

The £285 million revolving credit facility, provided by a syndicate of banks, matures in January 2024. On
12 August 2020, the Group executed an amendment agreement with its lenders to amend the financial covenants
under the facility to reflect the potential impact on the business of COVID-19. The amendments to the financial
covenants are for the period from September 2020 up to and including June 2022 and provide suitable headroom
based upon the Group’s downside projections, including an amendment to the maximum permitted leverage and
minimum liquidity, and a move to a more dynamic margin calculation of between 2.50% and 3.25%.

**Asset Backed Securitisation**

The Group has two non-recourse committed asset-backed securitisation term loans.

The first loan of £54.7 million as at 30 June 2021, secured on UK unsecured assets, pays LIBOR plus 3.1%. The
Group initially established a £100 million asset-backed facility in April 2019 with £137 million of ERC being
sold to a wholly owned subsidiary, AGL Fleetwood Limited and further ERC has been sold to AGL Fleetwood
Limited at various times since the initial set up allowing further borrowings to be drawn.

Since 1 January 2020, there has been one such drawing. On 31 March 2020, the Group sold £30 million of ERC
into AGL Fleetwood Limited and on 2 April 2020 borrowed an additional £21 million non-recourse funding on
the same terms under the facility.

During July 2020, the Group entered into further arrangements in connection with the non-recourse facility to
mitigate potential balance sheet cash collections impacts of COVID-19. An additional £33 million of 84-month ERC
was sold into the structure with no additional borrowings made. In consideration of the additional ERC pledged, the
lender agreed to amend certain performance criteria. Since July 2020, no further drawings have been made.

**15. Share based payments**

The following awards were made in 2021:

**Share incentive plan scheme (SIP)**

In 2021, the Company offered to all UK employees the opportunity to participate in the SIP, where the Company
gives the participating employees one matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee
using the participating employees’ gross salaries. The shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they
are purchased, with employees required to stay in employment for the vesting period to receive the shares.

**Restricted share award and deferred bonus share awards**

A restricted share award was made in April 2021, which vests the day after the annual 2021 results are
announced.

**Accelerated share-based payment charge**

In light of the potential acquisition of the business by TDR Capital, £2,623,000 of share-based costs have been
accelerated, which would have otherwise not been incurred in the reporting period. The share-based payment
charge before takeover costs for the period was £949,000, with a total share-based payment charge for the period
of £3,572,000.

**16. Financial instruments**

**Fair value estimation**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted
market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values
using other valuation techniques.

For instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires
judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other
risks affecting the specific instrument.

**Valuation models**

The Group measures fair values using a fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in
making the measurements.

**Financial instruments measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy**

The following table analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the

**16. Financial instruments (continued)**

The fair value of amortised cost portfolio investments has been calculated by observing the compression in
market yields over time and applying the difference between current average market IRRs for the Group’s most
recent vintage and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach takes into
account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the consideration of the individual
characteristics of each portfolio. As this calculation is based on unobservable inputs, these fair values would be
categorised as level 3 values.

The fair value of portfolio investments has been calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The three main
influencing factors in calculating this are:

(i) estimated future cash flows, derived from management forecasts

(ii) the application of an appropriate exit multiple

(iii) discounting using a rate appropriate to the investment and the anticipated rate of return

The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows
using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 30 June 2021.

The fair value of contingent consideration has been estimating the expected future payments arising from the
consideration, and discounting this at Arrow’s weighted average cost of debt, as this is deemed to represent the
rate at which the market prices the credit risk of the Group for such payables.

The total 84-month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £343,998,000, with an
average discount rate of 14.4%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £2,393,000/(£2,393,000). An increase/decrease in the
discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at
FVTPL of (£5,261,000)/£5,465,000.

The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is £1,089,304,000, with an
average discount rate of 21.7%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £7,354,000/(£7,354,000). An increase/decrease
in the discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/ increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at
amortised of (£11,330,000)/£11,747,000. A full reconciliation between the opening and closing portfolio
investments held at FVTPL has been provided in note 10.

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**

**1. Our opinion is unmodified**

We have audited the financial statements of Arrow Global Group plc (“the Group”) for the year ended
31 December 2020 which comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,
consolidated and Parent Company statement of financial position, consolidated and Parent Company statement of
changes in equity, consolidated and Parent Company statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including the
accounting policies in note 3.

**In our opinion:**

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting
standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006;

- the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of, and as applied in accordance with the
provisions of, the Companies Act 2006; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation to the extent applicable.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient
and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.

We were first appointed as auditor by the Directors on 2 July 2014. The period of total uninterrupted engagement
is for the seven financial years ended 31 December 2020. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and
we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were
provided.

**2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of
the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not
due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the
key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with

F-23

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from
those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on
these matters.

**Key audit matter** **The risk** **Our response**


Our procedures included:

- **Controls design: We assessed the**
design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of controls over data
used in the cash flow forecasting
models including monitoring of debt
servicer collections, reconciliations of
system cash collected to actual
receipts, general IT controls over the
collection systems driving the
estimated future cash flows and
associated governance controls.

- **Our financial risk modelling**
**expertise: We assessed the**
implementation and methodology of
the most significant models used in
valuing the portfolio investments
using our own financial modelling and
valuation specialists. We specifically
assessed the appropriateness of
changes to the Group’s methodology
to estimate future cash flows by
consideration of recent cash flow
collections in light of COVID-19
macroeconomic uncertainty.

- **Our economic scenario expertise:**
We involved our economic specialists
to assist us through benchmarking to
industry consensus and wider market
to assess the appropriateness of the
Group’s judgement and methodology
for determining the economic
scenarios used and the probability
weightings applied to them.

- **Critical assessment of cash flows:**
We undertook a risk based selection
process to determine a sample to
critically assess the cash flow
forecasts and any manual adjustments
made by the Group. The assessment of
cash flows was made with reference to
actual historic collections, underlying
economic and operational conditions
and our understanding of the Group.
We also considered the methodology
against our knowledge of our industry
peers.

**Forecast based valuation:**

The measurement of portfolio investments
involves significant judgement and
estimation of the remaining cash
collections in each portfolio. The impact of
COVID-19 related macroeconomic
uncertainty has increased the level of
judgement and estimation related to the
measurement of portfolio investments.

The areas where we identified heightened
levels of judgement and estimation in the
measurement of portfolio investments and
therefore increased audit focus are:

- **Model estimations – inherently**
judgemental modelling is used to
estimate future cash flows. The
assumptions used in the models
include the probability and timing of
expected future cash flows for each
type of asset class within a portfolio or
at a portfolio level. The Group
adapted its cash-flow modelling in the
year to respond to COVID-19 related
macroeconomic uncertainty.

- **Economic scenarios – significant**
judgement is applied to determine the
economic scenarios used and the
probability weighting assigned to
each, particularly with COVID-19
related macroeconomic uncertainty.

- **Collection strategy – the estimate of**
remaining cash collections are
sensitive to changes in management’s
strategy in managing the portfolios.

- **Business plan assumptions – the**
estimation of remaining cash
collections for each portfolio
investment is underpinned by a
business plan. Significant judgement
and estimation is applied in
determining a portfolio investment
business plan, particularly in light of
COVID-19 related macroeconomic
uncertainty.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of
our risk assessment, we determined that
estimation of future cash collections from

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

**Key audit matter** **The risk** **Our response**



- **Recalculations: We recalculated the**
portfolio investment valuation for
each of the Group’s portfolios. We
performed sample testing over key
inputs, data and assumptions to assess
the reasonableness of economic
forecasts, weights, and model
assumptions applied.

- **Assessing transparency: We**
critically assessed the adequacy of the
disclosures regarding the degree of
estimation uncertainty involved in
arriving at the valuation and the
accounting judgements made in
determining the measurement basis
and valuation.

**Our results**

- We found the estimation of future
cash collections from portfolio
investments to fall within an
acceptable range and the related
disclosures to be acceptable (2019
result: acceptable).

Our procedures included:

- **Our sector experience: We**
considered the Directors’ assessment
of sources of risk for the Group’s and
Parent Company’s business and
financial resources compared with our
own understanding of the risks. We
considered the Directors’ plans to take
action to mitigate the risks.

- **Challenge of assumptions: We**
inspected the Group’s and Parent
Company’s forecasting and liquidity
plans to identify the key assumptions
within these. We challenged the
reasonableness of assumptions
underpinning the Group’s and Parent
Company’s forecasts. We compared
the accuracy of management prior
projections versus actuals.

- **Funding assessment: We evaluated**
management’s assessment of the
entity’s compliance with debt
covenants and evaluated the feasibility
of management actions to improve the
position should a material risk arise.

- **Sensitivity analysis: We challenged**
management’s sensitivities over the
level of available financial resources
indicated by the Group’s and Parent

all portfolio investments has a high degree
of estimation uncertainty, with a potential
range of reasonable outcomes greater than
our materiality for the financial statements
as a whole and possibly many times that
amount. The financial statements (note 24)
disclose the sensitivity estimated by the
Group.

**Disclosure quality**

The disclosures regarding the Group’s
application of IFRS-9 are key to explaining
the key judgements and estimation to the
portfolio valuation.

**Disclosure quality:**

The financial statements explain how the
Directors have formed a judgement that it
is appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of preparation for the Group and
Parent Company, with no material
uncertainty identified and disclosed.

That judgement is based on an evaluation
of the inherent risks to the Group’s and
Parent Company’s business model and how
those risks might affect the Group’s and
Parent Company’s financial resources over
a period of at least a year from the date of
approval of the financial statements in a
range of plausible stress scenarios.

The risk most likely to affect the Group’s
and Parent Company’s financial resources
over the period was the heightened
macroeconomic uncertainty, due to
COVID-19 effects. This could result in
reduced cash collections from the Group’s
portfolio investments. We considered
whether these risks could plausibly affect
covenant compliance in the going concern
period by assessing the directors’
sensitivities over the level of available
financial resources and covenant thresholds
indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts
taking account of severe, but plausible,

F-25


-----

continued

**Key audit matter** **The risk** **Our response**


Company’s financial forecasts, taking
account of reasonably possible, but
not unrealistic, adverse effects that
could arise from these risk
individually and collectively. We
critically assessed and challenged the
stress testing performed by
management.

- **Assessing transparency: We assessed**
the completeness and accuracy of the
matters covered in the going concern
disclosure within the financial
statements using our knowledge of the
relevant facts and circumstances
developed during our audit work
whilst considering the economic
outlook, key areas of estimation
uncertainty and mitigating actions
available to the Group and Parent
Company to respond to these risks.

**Our results**

- We found the going concern
disclosure without any material
uncertainty to be acceptable (2019:
acceptable).

We performed the tests below rather than
seeking to rely on any of the Parent
Company’s controls because the nature of
the balance is such that we would expect to
obtain audit evidence primarily through the
detailed procedures described.

Our procedures included:

- **Tests of detail: We compared the**
carrying amount of 100% of
investments with the relevant
subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet to
identify whether their net assets, being
an approximation of their minimum
recoverable amount, were in excess of
their carrying amount and assessing
whether those subsidiaries have
historically been profit-making.

We assessed 100% of group debtors to
identify, with reference to the relevant
debtors’ draft balance sheet, whether they
have a positive net asset value and
therefore coverage of the debt owed, as
well as assessing whether those debtor
companies have historically been profitmaking.

- **Assessing subsidiary audits: We**
assessed the ability of the subsidiary

adverse effects that could arise from these
risks individually and collectively.

The risk for our audit is whether or not a
material uncertainty exists that may cast
significant doubt on the ability of the
Group and Parent Company to continue as
a going concern. Had there been such an
uncertainty, then that fact would need to be
disclosed.

**Low risk, high value:**

The carrying amount of the Parent
Company’s investments in subsidiaries and
intra-Group debtor balance represents
100% (2019: 100%) of the Parent
Company’s total assets. Their
recoverability is not at a high risk of
significant misstatement or subject to
significant judgement. However, due to
their materiality in the context of the Parent
Company financial statements, this is
considered to be the area that had the
greatest effect on our overall Parent
Company audit.

to obtain liquid funds and therefore
the ability of the subsidiary to fund the
repayment of the receivable.

                                        - **Comparing valuations: For the**
investments where the carrying
amount exceeded the net asset value,
we compared the carrying amount of
the investment with the higher of the
Group’s fair value (using the market
capitalisation as a suitable
approximation) and the expected value
of the underlying business based on
discounted cash flows.

**Our results**

We found the Parent Company’s
conclusion that there is no impairment of
its investments in subsidiaries and intragroup debtor balances to be acceptable
(2019: acceptable).

**Changes to our risks**

We continue to perform procedures over fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations.
However, with no new business combinations in the current financial period, we have not assessed this as one of
the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this
year.

In the prior year we reported a key audit matter in respect of the impact of uncertainties due to the UK exiting the
European Union. Following the trade agreement between the UK and the EU, and the end of the EU-exit
implementation period, the nature of these uncertainties has changed. We continue to perform procedures over
material assumptions in forward looking assessments such as estimation of portfolio investment future cashflows and going concern, however, we no longer consider the effect of the UK’s departure from the EU to be a
separate key audit matter.

**3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit**

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £2.1m, determined with reference to a
benchmark of revenue, normalised by averaging over the last three years due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on business operations, to £289.6m of which it represents 0.75%. In the prior year, materiality was set
at £3.0m, determined with reference to group profit before tax, normalised to exclude £1.3m acquisition costs
and £6.9m related to the expansion of the fund management business, of which it represented 5%. We consider
total revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on year than group
profit before tax, in addition, the loss before tax reported in the current year is such that group profit before tax
no longer serves as a useful benchmark.

Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £1.6m (2019: £1.9m), determined
with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets, of which it represents 0.3% (2019: 0.4%).

In line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were
performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that
individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the
financial statements as a whole.

F-27


-----

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

Performance materiality was set at 65% (2019: 65%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which
equates to £1.4m (2019: £1.9m) for the group and £1.0m (2019: £1.2m) for the parent company. We applied this
percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an
elevated level of risk.

We agreed to report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements for the Group
financial statements exceeding £100,000 (2019: £150,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

**How we scoped our audit**

Of the Group’s 8 (2019: 3) reporting components, we subjected 7 (2019: 3) to full scope audits for Group
purposes and 1 to specified risk-focused audit procedures. For 2020, we changed the definition of components
from geographical location (in 2019) to reporting component for consolidation purposes.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.

The Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £0.1m to £1.8m (2019: £1.2m to
£2.7m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.

The work on the overseas components was performed by overseas component auditors. The audit of the UK
component (including the audit of the Parent Company), was performed by the Group team.

The Group team held video conference meetings with the overseas component auditors throughout the audit.
During these meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, key audit working
papers were reviewed, and any further work required to be performed by the component auditor was instructed
by the Group team.

**4. Going concern**

The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate
the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and
the Parent Company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no
material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for
at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).

F-29


-----

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

An explanation of how we evaluated management’s assessment of going concern is set out in the related key
audit matter in section 2 of this report.

**Our conclusions based on this work:**

- we consider that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate;

- we have not identified, and concur with the Directors’ assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty
related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;

- we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the
financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company’s use of that basis for the going concern
period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and

- the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page F-39 is materially consistent with the financial
statements and our audit knowledge.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes
that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are
not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.

**5. Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations–ability to detect**

**Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud**

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could
indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment
procedures included:

- Enquiring of Directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation to the
Group’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function,
and the Group’s channel for “whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual,
suspected or alleged fraud;

- Reading Board minutes and attending audit committee meetings;

- Considering remuneration incentive scheme and performance targets for management; and

- Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.

We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud
throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full scope component audit teams of
relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the
Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.

As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets and our
overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management
override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make
inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. On this audit we do
not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition, with the exception of revenue earnt from portfolio
investments, because the calculation of revenue is based on contractual terms and requires no judgement.

We also identified a fraud risk in response to pressure to meet profit targets related to the measurement of
expected cash collections for portfolio investments.

In determining the audit procedures we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating
effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.

F-30


-----

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

We also performed procedures including:

- Identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the
identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by members of the Executive
Committee or Board, those posted by unauthorised individuals, those posted to unusual or seldom accounts,
those containing key words, those entries which have a value of zero or are unbalanced and those posted by
individuals who rarely do during ordinary course of business, and

- Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.

We discussed with the audit committee matters related to actual or suspected fraud, for which disclosure is not
necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.

**Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and**
**regulations**

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors
and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and
legal correspondence and discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

As the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment
including the entity’s procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of
non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full-scope component
audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component
auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give
rise to a material misstatement at Group.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including
financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and
taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our
procedures on the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the
imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:
data protection, anti-bribery, consumer protection and certain aspects of Company legislation, recognising the
financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to
identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and
inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not
disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.

We discussed with the audit committee matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for
which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.

**Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation**

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently
limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.

F-31


-----

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit
procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance
or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**6. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report**

The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do
not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial
statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial
statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in
the other information.

**Strategic report and Directors’ report**

Based solely on our work on the other information:

- we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the Directors’ report;

- in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

- in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**Directors’ remuneration report**

In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability**

We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the
Directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial
statements and our audit knowledge.

Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- the Directors’ confirmation within the statement of viability on page 53 of the 2020 Annual Report that they
have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;

- the Principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified,
and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and

- the Directors’ explanation in the statement of viability of how they have assessed the prospects of the
Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

We are also required to review the statement of viability, set out on page 53 of the 2020 Annual Report under the
Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially
consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial
statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of
anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s longer-term
viability.

**Corporate governance disclosures**

We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the
Directors’ corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.

Based on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the
financial statements and our audit knowledge:

- the Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is
fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy;

- the section of the annual report describing the work of the audit committee, including the significant issues
that the audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were
addressed; and

- the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk
management and internal control systems.

We are required to review the part of Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group’s compliance with
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have
nothing to report in this respect.

**7. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**8. Respective responsibilities**

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 111 of the 2020 Annual Report, the Directors are
responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Note – There has been a reclassification between the two operating expenses rows ‘collection activity and fund
management costs’ and ‘other operating expenses’ in the prior year. This change was made to better reflect the
evolved nature of the Group’s business model and presenting direct costs of the Group’s business lines is deemed
to provide more relevant information. As such, we have reclassified £21,729,000 from ‘other operating expenses’
to ‘collection activity and fund management costs’ in the prior period. The total operating expenses impact is
£nil. Further information can be found in note 10.

The parent company’s profit after tax for the year was £8,330,000 (2019: £11,897,000).

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
**For the year ended 31 December 2020**

**1.1 General information**

Arrow Global Group plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated in England and Wales and is the ultimate
parent company of the Group. The address of the registered office is presented on the inside back cover. The
financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency. All amounts
have been rounded to the nearest thousand except when otherwise indicated. The Company’s subsidiaries, both
direct and indirect, at 31 December 2020 are listed in note 23.

The Group’s principal activity is to identify, acquire and manage secured and unsecured defaulted and non-core
loan portfolios and real estate from, and on behalf of financial institutions such as banks, institutional investors
and credit card companies.

**1.2 Basis of preparation, consolidation and going concern**

The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 have been prepared
in accordance with the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 (’Adopted IFRS’). The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior
periods, noting a refinement of approach to the valuation of the portfolio assets in response to the COVID-19
situation, which is set out in detail in note 4.

The Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation
(EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU.

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes of the
Company have not been presented in this annual report and accounts. As permitted by section 479c of the
Companies Act 2006, the Group has chosen to take the subsidiary companies audit exemption in the UK, with
the parent Company providing a declaration of guarantee for the year ended 31 December 2020. A full listing of
the subsidiaries availing of the guarantee and audit exemption is set out in note 23.

The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair
value of derivative contracts and certain portfolio investments and the amortised cost accounting for other
financial assets and liabilities.

**Going concern statement**

In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate to adopt for the Group as at 31 December 2020, the
directors have undertaken thorough analysis of forecast cash flow models and scenarios for a period of at least 12
months from the date of approval of these accounts, with the primary focus of detailed forecasting running to the
end of 2022.

Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 crisis and its anticipated impacts on Estimated Remaining
Collections (ERC), the Group has protected its liquidity and covenant position by raising additional funding and
has renegotiated its financial covenants with its revolving credit facility lenders, as set out further in note 29.

A base case forecast, and several downside scenarios, have been prepared reflecting the Group’s current financial
position and expected future performance. Key items considered within each forecast were the future outlook for
HPI and unemployment, including the length and severity of any potential macroeconomic shock, and the impact
these may have on the Group’s cash flows. These cash flows were considered against the Group’s future liquidity
position, taking into account that there are no bond maturities until 2024. Adherence to the Group’s liquidity,
leverage and ERC loan-to-value covenants was also considered in all scenarios.

The results of this scenario analysis show that even in a severe but plausible downside scenario, after taking
reasonable management actions (such as cost reductions, slowing purchases and collection acceleration) as
required, the Group is able to maintain sufficient liquidity and cash reserves to operate within banking covenants,
and to continue as a going concern. This scenario was aligned to the severe downside forecasts outlined in note
24.

Finally, a reverse stress test has also been prepared, incorporating a plausible set of management actions, to
identify the magnitude of a downside stress that needs to occur to cause the group to breach its financial

**1.2 Basis of preparation, consolidation and going concern continued**

covenants. It has been concluded that this represents an overly severe and implausible scenario. Based on all of
the above indicators, the directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a
going concern basis.

**2. Accounting standards**

**New standards**

The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year beginning 1 January 2020:

 - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards;

 - Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3);

 - Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8);

 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7); and

 - Extension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4).

The Group chose to early adopt the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and
IFRS 7’ early in 2019.

During 2020, these new standards and interpretations had an insignificant effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

**2.1 Standards issued but not yet adopted**

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2020 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements as they do not have a material effect on
the Group’s financial statements.

The following amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements:

 - COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16);

 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16);

 - Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37);

 - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020;

 - Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16);

 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3);

 - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts;

 - Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1); and

 - Amendments to IFRS 17.

**3. Significant accounting policies**

**Business combinations**

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the
Group.

The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets
acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is

F-40

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to
the issue of debt or equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss.

**Contingent consideration**

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay
contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is
remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

**Non-controlling interests (NCI)**

NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity
transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2020 and the comparative period.

‘Subsidiaries’ are entities controlled by the Group. The Group ‘controls’ an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the
elements of control. This includes circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a
lending relationship) become substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on
which control commences until the date on which control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed
of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with
those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on
consolidation. Also, see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee benefit trust’ (EBT).

**Securitisation vehicles**

Securitisation vehicles in which the Group holds an economic interest are usually operated according to
predetermined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles. The Group is exposed to variability of
returns from the vehicles through its holding of various securities in the vehicles.

Outside the day-to-day servicing of the receivables (which may be carried out by the Group under a servicing
contract), key decisions are usually required only when the intent of the participants regarding the design of the
economic structure or the strategy for the collection of the underlying assets changes.

In assessing whether it has control, the Group considers whether it manages the key decisions that most
significantly affect these vehicles’ returns, alongside its total variability related to its economic interests in the
vehicles. As a result, the Group has concluded that it controls some of these vehicles, but not all (for more
information on consolidated vehicles, see note 27).

F-41

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Investment funds**

The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds. Determining whether the Group controls such
an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the
fund (comprising any carried interests and expected management fees) and the investors’ rights to remove fund
manager. For all funds managed by the Group, the investors are able to vote by simple majority, less than ten
investors, to remove the Group as fund manager without cause.

In summary, the number of investors who are required to act together to remove the Group as fund manager
without cause is low. Although similar, the investment strategies of the Group and other investors in the fund are
different, with the Group having the option to not invest in certain circumstances. Therefore, despite the Group’s
variability of its aggregate economic interest in some cases being above 30% (depending on which items are
included/excluded), the Group has concluded that it acts as agent for the investors in all cases, and therefore has
not consolidated these funds.

For further disclosure in respect of unconsolidated securitisation vehicles and investment funds in which the
Group has an interest or for which it is a sponsor, see note 27.

**i. Loss of control**

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any
interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

**ii. Transactions eliminated upon consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency
transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment.

**Foreign Currency**

**i. Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the
spot exchange rates at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling, which
is also the presentational currency of the Group.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the
spot exchange rate at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference
between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest
and payments during the year and the carrying amount in the foreign currency, translated at the spot exchange
rate at the end of the year.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the
functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary
items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate
at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency differences arising on translation are generally recognised in profit or loss.

**ii. Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated into sterling at the spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses

F-42


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the monthly average exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve
(translation reserve).

When a foreign operation is disposed of in such a way that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the
translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on
disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation whilst
still retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI.

**Interest**

**i. Effective interest rate**

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective
interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected
life of the financial instrument to:

 - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or

 - the amortised cost of the financial liability.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated creditimpaired assets, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial
instrument, but not the expected credit loss (ECL).

For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated
using estimated future cash flows including ECL. This is the case for all the Group’s portfolio investments held
at amortised cost, recognised since the introduction of IFRS 9.

Additionally, for such assets, the future cash flows are forecast across the next 84 months following the balance
sheet date. This is the point by which substantially all of the cash flows will have been received from a normal
portfolio investment.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability, such as legal and due diligence fees.

**ii. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount**

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or
financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative
amortisation, using the effective interest method, of any difference between that initial amount and the expected
cash flows and, for financial assets, adjusted for any ECL allowance. The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial
asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any ECL allowance. However, for amortised
cost portfolio assets the concept of a separable ECL allowance is not applied, because due to the nature of the
portfolio assets, expected cash flows are forecast including an estimate of ECLs, including multiple economic
scenarios.

**iii. Calculation of interest income and expense**

The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition. In
calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the
asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is
revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating-rate instruments to reflect movements in

F-43


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date on
which amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins.

For financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is
calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no
longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, which includes all of the Group’s portfolio
investments held at amortised cost, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest
rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if
the credit risk of the asset improves. Subsequently, the carrying value of the portfolios is adjusted by updating
future cash receipts and discounting them using the original credit adjusted effective interest rate with the
subsequent remeasurement recognised as impairment through the statement of profit or loss.

Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in fair
value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL.

**Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL**

Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL represents all of the income and expenses relating to the
Group’s portfolio investments which are classified as FVTPL. The line item includes fair value changes, interest
and dividends.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established. Usually, this is the ex-dividend
date for quoted equity securities. Dividends are presented in fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL
or other income based on the underlying classification of the instrument.

**Leases**

**i. Group acting as a leasee**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price. However, for
leases of premises the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and
non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of
costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to
the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is
periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as
the discount rate.

F-44


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources
and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

 - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

 - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date;

 - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

 - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in
an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties
for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there
is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the Group’s estimate
of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of
whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed
lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of
the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset
has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other
payables’ in the statement of financial position.

**ii. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets**

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and
short-term leases, including leases of IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with
these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**iii. Group acting as a lessor**

None of the arrangements that the Group has entered into have been determined to constitute the Group acting as
a lessor under the definitions of IFRS 16.

**Taxation**

**i. Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that
it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments,
do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore has accounted for them under IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and has recognised the related expenses in ‘other expenses’.

**ii. Current tax**

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or
receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related
to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

F-45


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

**iii. Deferred tax asset**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognised for:

 - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

 - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the
foreseeable future; and

 - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future
taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of
taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits,
adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on business plans for individual
subsidiaries in the Group.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable
profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if
there is any.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the
Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this
purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through
sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities**

**i. Recognition and initial measurement**

The Group initially recognises portfolio investments, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities on the
date on which they are acquired. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of
financial assets) are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial
asset or financial liability not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue
of a financial asset or financial liability. The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is generally
its transaction price.

**ii. Classification**

**Financial assets**

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated
as at FVTPL:

 - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
and

 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest (SPPI).

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated
as at FVTPL:

 - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets; and

 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. No
such elections have been made by the Group. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the
requirements to be measured at amortised cost or as at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. No such designations have been made by the Group.

**Business model assessment**

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level
because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The
information considered includes:

 - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In
particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a
particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities
that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;

 - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;

 - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business
model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;

 - how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the
assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and

 - frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about
future sales activity.

However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of
how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The Group’s portfolio investments are comprised of various types of underlying credit positions. The majority of
investments are held by the Group for the primary purpose of collecting the underlying cash flows to the fullest
extent possible. Sales of such portfolio investments are not a common occurrence and are not part of
management’s strategy for such investments when they are purchased.

The Group’s co-investment alongside its Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to be held in a
different business model than ‘hold to collect’, as these portfolio investments are managed primarily on a fair
value basis, with reporting to senior management on the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis,
and key management remuneration being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such,
the business model of these assets is neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect
contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. As such, the Group’s co-investment alongside its Fund and
Investment Management business is classified as FVTPL.

**Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest**

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated
with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual
cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing
whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash
flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:

 - contingent events changing the amount and timing of cash flows;

 - leverage features;

 - prepayment and extension terms;

 - terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and

 - features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

Equity and similar instruments have contractual cash flows that do not meet the SPPI criterion. Accordingly, all
such financial assets are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI option is selected.

**Contractually linked instruments**

The Group has some investments in securitisations that are considered contractually linked instruments.
Contractually linked instruments each have a specified subordination ranking that determines the order in which
any cash flows generated by the pool of underlying investments are allocated to the instruments. Such an
instrument meets the SPPI criterion only if all of the following conditions are met:

 - the contractual terms of the instrument itself give rise to cash flows that are SPPI without looking through to
the underlying pool of financial instruments;

 - the underlying pool of financial instruments (i) contains one or more instruments that give rise to cash flows
that are SPPI; and (ii) may also contain instruments, such as derivatives, that reduce the cash flow
variability of the instruments under (i) and the combined cash flows (of the instruments under (i) and (ii))
give rise to cash flows that are SPPI; or align the cash flows of the contractually linked instruments with the
cash flows of the pool of underlying instruments under (i) arising as a result of differences in whether
interest rates are fixed or floating or the currency or timing of cash flows; and

 - the exposure to credit risk inherent in the contractually linked instruments is equal to or less than the
exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments.

**Reclassifications**

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group
changes its business model for managing financial assets.

**Financial assets**

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers
nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial
asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying
amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received
(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had
been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

F-48


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is
not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets
that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value
of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The
transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the
servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for
performing the servicing.

**Financial liabilities**

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.

**i. Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities**

If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified
asset are substantially different.

If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial
asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial
asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification
are accounted for as follows:

 - fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement
of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and

 - other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of
the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the
original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss
in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of
the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. The gain
or loss is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified
liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is
recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and
the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred,
if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as a derecognition, then the amortised cost of the
liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment
to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability
by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

**ii. Offsetting**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends
either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

F-49


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS Standards, or for gains and
losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.

**iii. Fair value measurement**

‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most
advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its
non-performance risk.

When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place
with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of
relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction
price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on
initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an
active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable
inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the difference, then the financial instrument is initially
measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the
transaction price.

Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument
but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed
out.

The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount
payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period
during which the change has occurred.

**iv. Impairment**

The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on financial assets that are debt instruments, and that are not
measured at FVTPL. No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments. The Group has not taken the low
credit risk exemption for any of its financial assets.

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for financial instruments (other
than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition
(excluding credit-impaired assets), for which they are measured as 12-month ECL.

12-month ECL are the portion of lifetime ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are
possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which 12-month ECL are
recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’. Financial instruments allocated to Stage 1 have not
undergone a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and are not credit-impaired.

Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial
instrument or the maximum contractual period of exposure. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are
recognised but that are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’. Financial
instruments allocated to Stage 2 are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition but are not credit-impaired.

F-50


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognised and that are credit-impaired are referred to as
‘Stage 3 financial instruments’.

**Measurement of ECL**

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

 - financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls
(i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash
flows that the Group expects to receive);

 - financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date, except POCI financial assets: as the difference
between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; or

 - POCI financial assets: the ECL is incorporated into the estimated future cash flows, therefore it is not
possible to separate this from a ‘gross carrying amount’ of these assets. As such, although ECL is
incorporated into the carrying amount, a separate loss allowance is not held for POCI financial assets. The
only material assets in this category are the portfolio investments held at amortised cost.

When discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:

 - financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets and lease
receivables: the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof;

 - POCI assets: a credit-adjusted effective interest rate; or

 - lease receivables: the discount rate used in measuring the lease receivable.

**Restructured financial assets**

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified, then an assessment is made of whether the financial
asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

 - If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash
flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the
existing asset; or

 - If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of
the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its
derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset
that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective
interest rate of the existing financial asset.

**Credit-impaired financial assets**

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired
(referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that
have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

 - significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;

 - a breach of contract such as a default or past-due event;

 - the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;

 - it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

 - the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

F-51

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**POCI financial assets**

POCI financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. For POCI assets, lifetime ECL are
incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate on initial recognition. Consequently, POCI assets do
not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognised as a loss allowance subsequent
to initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition of the asset.

**Designation at fair value through profit or loss**

The Group has not designated any financial assets or liabilities as FVTPL in either the current or previous
periods.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

‘Cash and cash equivalents’ include notes and coins on hand and highly liquid financial assets with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.

**Derivatives held for risk management purposes and hedge accounting**

All derivatives are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. The Group designates certain
derivatives held for risk management as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.

On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objective and strategy in undertaking the
hedge, together with the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.

The Group makes an assessment, both on inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the hedging instrument(s) is (are) expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair
value or cash flows of the respective hedged item(s) during the period for which the hedge is designated, and
whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80–125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast
transaction, the Group makes an assessment of whether the forecast transaction is highly probable to occur and
presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.

**Other assets**

No ECL has been recognised for intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents or trade and other receivables,
on the basis that the ECL on such items is deemed to be immaterial.

**Cash flow hedges**

When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable
to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or highly probable forecast transaction that
could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI
and presented in the hedging reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in the hedging reserve is
reclassified from OCI to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period as the hedged cash
flows affect profit or loss, and in the same line item in the statement of profit or loss and OCI.

If the hedging derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for
cash flow hedge accounting, or the hedge designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued
prospectively. However, if the derivative is novated to a central counterparty clearing house by both parties as a
consequence of laws or regulations without changes in its terms except for those that are necessary for the
novation, then the derivative is not considered expired or terminated. If the hedged cash flows are no longer

F-52

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

expected to occur, then the Group immediately reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit
or loss. For terminated hedging relationships, if the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur, then the
amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is not reclassified until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss; if
the hedged cash flows are expected to affect profit or loss in multiple reporting periods, then the Group
reclassifies the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss on a straight-line basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

**i. Recognition and measurement**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that
equipment.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised within other income in
profit or loss.

**ii. Subsequent expenditure**

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the
expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

**iii. Depreciation**

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated
residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in
profit or loss. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives of property and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

Furniture five years
Computer equipment three years
Leasehold improvements five years
Vehicles three years
Right-of-use assets based on contractual terms

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**Intangible assets and goodwill**

**i. Software licences and IT platforms**

Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Expenditure on internally developed software, such as IT platforms, is recognised as an asset when the Group is
able to demonstrate that the product is technically and commercially feasible, its intention and ability to complete
the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and that it can
reliably measure the costs to complete the development.

**Intangible assets and goodwill**

The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the
software plus capitalised borrowing costs and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is
stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

F-53


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as it is
incurred.

Software, including IT platforms, is amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful
life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and
comparative periods is three to ten years. Amortisation is disclosed within other expenses within the statement of
profit and loss.

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**ii. Customer intangibles**

When the Group acquires businesses which have material ongoing customer relationships, whether they are
contractual or not, the principles of IFRS 3 dictate that the fair value of such customer relationships must be
estimated and recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition date. The impact of this is to effectively reduce
the goodwill recognised on acquisition.

Subsequent to the initial recognition of such assets, they are amortised over the expected life of the customer
relationships with the Group. This amortisation is recognised within operating expenses.

The useful lives and carrying values of customer intangibles are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**iii. Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment
properties and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows
from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising
from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is based on the estimated future post-tax cash flows, discounted to their present value using a
post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The
Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one CGU. Corporate
assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing
of the CGUs to which the corporate assets are allocated.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a
pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

F-54

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are stated subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs
and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over
the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the
Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of
financial position date.

The Group classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the
substance of the contractual terms of the instruments.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation with an outflow of economic
resources. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the consideration required to settle that
obligation at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position and are discounted to present value.

**Employee benefits**

**i. Share-based payment transactions**

Share-based payment transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own
equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments.

The grant date fair value of the share-based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense,
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to
the awards.

The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect
the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be
met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the
related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

For share-based payments with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is
measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual
outcomes. Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, the costs
are recharged to the subsidiary in line with the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’.

**ii. Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)**

Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore,
reflected in these financial statements.

**iii. Retirement benefit costs**

Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as the employees provide services to the
Group.

The Group makes contributions to defined contribution plans to provide pension benefits for employees upon
retirement, and otherwise, has no residual obligation or commitments in respect of any defined benefit scheme.

**Inventories**

As part of the Group’s investment activities, it sometimes acquires real estate positions as part of a transaction.
Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a sale will immediately follow

F-55

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the asset, such investments fall under the scope of
IAS 2 – Inventories.

In line with IAS 2, all assets classified as inventories are held at initial cost, plus any subsequent cost of capital
expenditure. Such assets are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, but apart from this, no gain or loss
will be taken on the value of the assets until the point at which they are sold, or partially sold.

**Associates**

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and
operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the
voting power of another entity, or can demonstrate significant influence, or evidence through a number of aspects
such as representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making and decisions, material
transactions between the entity and investee, interchange of managerial personnel or provision of essential
technical information. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of the associate from the date that significant influence commences until the date that it ceases.

**Share capital and reserves**

**i. Share capital**

Incremental costs that are directly attributable to the issue of an equity instrument are deducted from the initial
measurement of the equity instruments.

**ii. Other reserves**

Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are
further explained in note 19.

**Intercompany receivables**

The Company holds material intercompany receivables within its statement of financial position.

These have been assessed under the IFRS 9 ECL criteria, measuring expected losses over the longest contractual
period the Company is exposed to credit risks. The Company has concluded that these assets have no material
ECL.

**Income from asset management and servicing**

**I. Servicing fees**

The Group undertakes various asset servicing and collection roles on behalf of its customers. The majority of this
activity is performed at a point in time, and the service is deemed to have been provided to the customer either
due to the passage of time, or upon the completion of an action such as making a collection or sending a
notification to the customer. Therefore, in accordance with IFRS 15, the revenue from asset management and
servicing activities is recognised either upon the completion of such actions. Where the Group is contracted to
perform activities over time, such as master servicing arrangements, the fee is recognised as the services are
performed, with time elapsed being the measure of progress.

**Ii. Asset management fees**

The Group earns management fees from its performance of asset management services. Management fees are
charged on third-party money managed by the Group and are based on an agreed percentage of either committed
money, invested money or net asset value (NAV), dependent on the fund. Management fees are variable fee

F-56

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

revenue streams, which relate to one performance obligation and contain a non-performance and performancerelated fee element. The non-performance element of the fee is recognised as the services are performed, with
time elapsed being the measure of progress. Performance related fees are discussed below.

**iIi. Performance-related fees**

Performance-related fees are recognised only where it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in
the future. This is generally near the end of the performance period or upon early liquidation of a fund.
Performance-related fees will only be crystallised when a performance hurdle is met. The estimate of
performance fees is made with reference to the liquidation profile for the fund, which factors in portfolio exits
and timeframes. A constraint is applied to the estimate to reflect uncertainty of future fund performance.

**iv. Contract balances**

In some instances, fees may be paid to a third party which are directly linked to the acquisition of a long-term
contract with a customer. In line with IFRS 15 requirements, such costs are taken to the balance sheet as a cost to
acquire a customer contract, and are released to the comprehensive statement of profit or loss over time, on a
profile corresponding with the period over which economic benefits will be derived from the contract. Further
Information on the Group’s contract balances can be found in note 6.

**Operating expenses**

Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated with collection activities. All operating costs are
accounted for on an accruals basis.

**Earnings per share**

The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the
profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss that is
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.

**Segment reporting**

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn
income and incur expenses, including income and expenses relating to transactions with any of the Group’s other
components, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker
(CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for
which discrete financial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the Group’s board (being
the CODM) include items that are directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a
reasonable basis.

**Deferred and contingent consideration**

During the normal course of business, the Group enters in agreements with third parties to purchase portfolios of
financial assets, and the consideration paid may include an element of deferred consideration. Such consideration
is discounted at the Group’s weighted average cost of debt to its present value at the point of initial recognition of
the acquired portfolio asset, and this discounted amount is included within the purchase price of the portfolio
asset. A liability for the discounted amount of deferred consideration is also recognised at this time. Subsequent
to this, the discount taken from the gross deferred consideration payable to the initial present value is recognised
in the income statement as a finance cost over time.

Usually as part of business acquisitions, the Group also enters into arrangements with third parties to pay
amounts in the future which are contingent on the outcome of a future event, such as the acquired business
meeting certain operational or financial targets. In such instances, the Group forms an initial estimation of the
fair value of such consideration by assessing the likelihood of paying out a range of amounts, and using this
analysis to calculate the probability-weighted average expected pay-out. This amount is then discounted at the

Group’s cost of debt to bring it to its present value at the point of acquisition. An assessment is made at this point
as to whether the payments constitute a post-employment benefit arrangement with former owners, or not. If this
is not the case, the present value is included within the consideration paid to acquire the business and within
goodwill, if relevant. Each period, the discount is unwound to the income statement as a finance cost, and the
liability is remeasured to its current fair value at that point in time.

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates**

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

**Judgements**

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is set out below.

**i. Classification of portfolio investment assets**

The Group holds the majority of its portfolio investments at amortised cost, due to the fact that management have
determined that these assets meet the SPPI criteria, and are held in a ‘hold to collect’ business model. The SPPI
criteria for each portfolio are assessed at the point each portfolio is being approved for purchase, and are based
on the nature of the underlying loans which are being purchased. This determination is made for each purchase
individually, unless it is a follow-on purchase of the same or very similar assets, which have already been
assessed.

Regarding the ‘hold to collect’ business model, the Group has determined that this is the most appropriate IFRS 9
business model classification for its general portfolio holding activities, as although in the past a small number of
portfolios have been sold outright to a third party, such sales do not comprise a material component of the
Group’s ERC at any point in time. Therefore, such infrequent sales activity is not deemed to invalidate the ‘hold
to collect’ business model which the Group employs for the majority of its portfolios.

Another judgement that has been made regarding the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets is that they all fall
within the POCI classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made by
the Group, based upon the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of the amortised cost
portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are credit impaired in
some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the fact that they are usually
purchased at a deep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit losses to date.

For some portfolio investments, the SPPI criteria is not met, or there is an element of subordination within the
holding structure. In such instances, these portfolio investments are held at FVTPL. Furthermore, some portfolio
investments, such as those involving real estate, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument for
accounting purposes. This leads to a portion of the Group’s portfolio investments being classified as
‘inventories’, under the scope of IAS 2.

The Group’s co-investment alongside its Fund and Investment Management business is deemed to be held in a
different business model than ‘hold to collect’, as these portfolios are managed primarily on a fair value basis,
with reporting to senior management on the performance of these assets being prepared on that basis, and key
management remuneration being linked to the performance of such assets on a fair value basis. As such, the
business model of these assets has been judged to be neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both
to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. As such, the Group’s co-investment alongside its
Fund and Investment Management business is classified as FVTPL.

**ii. Determination of control over investees**

Arrow holds an economic interest in a number of entities which it determines under IFRS 10, that it does not
control. As such, these entities are not consolidated into the Group’s financial statements, but rather, the

F-58


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued**

investment in such entities is recognised as a single asset within the appropriate balance sheet classification,
usually portfolio investments. Conversely, the Group also consolidates entities into its financial statements which
it does not have 100% ownership of, but the Group is judged to control regardless.

The judgement as to whether or not the Group has control over an entity is taken on a case-by-case basis by
management, and is firstly based upon whether the Group can exercise any power over the relevant activities of
the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between such power and the variability of
the Group’s returns which arise from the entity.

In many cases, the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply more judgement can
occur where the Group holds a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured entity, as well as providing
services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship capacity. In these cases, the Group mainly
assesses the relative share of marginal variable returns which flow to third parties versus the share which flows to
the Group as a primary indicator of whether the Group is exercising any power it may have to influence the
variable returns of the structured entity, either for its own benefit, or for the benefit of third parties in the
structure. In the case of the former, the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter, the entity
will usually not be consolidated.

**Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

**i. Carrying value of portfolio investments**

The carrying value of portfolio investments is £1,042,215,000 at 31 December 2020 (2019: £1,163,624,000). The
majority of these portfolio investments are measured at amortised cost. Given the speed and severity of the
economic changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about, the Group has further refined the method by
which ERCs and therefore portfolio valuations are calculated for the current accounting period.

As at 31 December 2019, a bottom-up approach was taken whereby each individual portfolio’s cash flow has
been modelled based on a number of factors, including balance sheet cash collections history and an array of data
concerning the status of the individual loans within these portfolios, for example account-specific balance sheet
cash collections history, account statuses, property statuses and valuations (for secured accounts), servicer
history, and supporting data from third parties such as credit files or geo-demographics. This data has then been
used in conjunction with the predicted effectiveness of any additional collection initiatives to forecast future
balance sheet cash collections for each portfolio.

These forecast balance sheet cash collections were then updated for balance sheet cash collections throughout
2020, before being used as the basis for the 31 December 2020 reforecast. Management believe the nature of the
current crisis has caused a temporary dislocation in how future balance sheet cash collections will trend, based on
balance sheet cash collections data to date. Accordingly, the Group has instead sought to determine how the
anticipated more volatile macroeconomic environment will impact the bottom-up portfolio-level ERC forecasts,
via a series of overlays, taking into account forecast future macroeconomic circumstances. To achieve this, each
of the Group’s portfolios were first divided into a specified number of risk segments, with each segment
containing loans of a similar nature (for example, UK unsecured loans).

In addition, individually material and/or complex portfolios were also considered separately as their own
‘segment’. For each segment, for the most relevant macroeconomic indicators, a range of possible future
outcomes was forecast, each representing either an upside, downside or severe downside scenario. The impact of
each scenario on the Group’s future cash flows was determined in conjunction with the Group’s internal experts
in the relevant segment, considering both past experience and knowledge about the current condition of the local
environment.

Using statistical methods, a probability was also assigned to each segment-level scenario, giving consideration to
updated external macroeconomic forecasts, balance sheet cash collections performance throughout the year and
local in-house knowledge. These probabilities assigned were then used to calculate a probability-weighted ERC
change for each segment, save for a small number of individual portfolios in which management judgement was
applied. The weighted segment-level adjustments were then applied to each portfolio within each respective
segment to allow the production of portfolio-level ERC curves.

F-59

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued**

The portfolio-level ERC curves were then discounted at the appropriate rate (EIR for amortised cost portfolios, a
rate reflective of assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset for FVTPL portfolios), to
obtain the revised NPV and hence carrying value of the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments. For
REO portfolio investments, the revised ERC curve was used to determine the net realisable value in assessing
each portfolio for potential impairment.

Numerical disclosures and sensitivities have been set out in note 24, to assist the users of these statements in
understanding the financial impact of the most recent reforecast.

In addition to the scenario modelling set out above, another key judgement that has been applied by management
is the probability weighting of each of these scenarios. The precise weightings used have been set out in note 24
and were based on management’s judgement on how each of its scenarios aligns to the macroeconomic forecasts
provided by third party experts, as well as the view of local internal experts in the relevant geography and asset
class. Such scenarios also take into account operational considerations that may impact balance sheet cash
collections in each individual geography, such as the functioning of local court systems or property markets for
example.

The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgement in these financial
statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of
the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments as at 31 December 2020 by +/- £9,810,000 (2019: +/£11,020,000). The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/judgement in these
financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period would increase/(reduce)
the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2020 by £8,637,000/(£11,012,000)
(2019: £12,453,000/(£17,326,000)). Note that there are a large number of inputs that are used to derive the ERC
and hence the carrying value of portfolios. However, many of these are factual historical data points which do not
individually involve significant estimation uncertainty, and as such, an overall combined sensitivity has been
provided.

**ii. Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations**

The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies.
Goodwill is the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore the fair
value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. The determination of
the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those
financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired portfolio investments
and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different
valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired
entities. Further detail on the valuation of acquired loan portfolios is given in section i. above. Note 30 provides
further detail on acquisitions and the net assets acquired on each.

**iii. Impairment assessment of goodwill balances**

The carrying amount of goodwill is £278,338,000 at 31 December 2020. In line with the Group’s accounting
policies, the goodwill balance is assessed for impairment at each annual reporting date. The impairment
assessment is carried out on a value in use basis, using discounted cash flow models for each cash generating unit
(CGU) to determine whether the ongoing value in use of each CGU is higher than its carrying amount. No
impairment was recognised as a result of the assessment performed as at 31 December 2020. This assessment is
sensitive to the discount rate applied, and management’s forecast future cash flows for each CGU. Further
information about the methodology applied and sensitivities to these factors are disclosed in note 13.

**5. Segmental reporting**

The Group launched its first fund in December 2019. As the Group moves increasingly to an integrated asset
manager model, it has aligned its segmental methodology during the year to the new business model. Segmental
information has been provided in line with what is reviewed on a regular basis by the chief operating decision
maker (CODM), which is the board of directors collectively, as defined in IFRS 8. In the Annual Report and
Accounts 2019, the Group reported under three separate reportable segments. Under the new segmental

F-60


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**5. Segmental reporting continued**

disclosure, the Group will now report under four separates reportable segments, with the Fund and Investment
Management business separated out from the Asset Management and Servicing business segment. The principal
business categories are as follows:

Balance Sheet business All portfolio investments that the Group owns, and the income and costs
associated with them.

Asset Management and Income and costs associated with managing debt portfolios on behalf of the
Servicing business (AMS) Group and external servicers.

Fund and Investment Income and costs associated with managing debt portfolios on behalf of our fund
Management business (FIM) clients and the Group’s Balance Sheet business.

Group functions Costs not directly associated with the other three segments, but relevant to overall
oversight and control of the Group’s activities.

These segments represent how the Group manages the wider business, and the organisational structure is aligned
to these segments. Therefore, this has been deemed to be the appropriate level of disaggregation to provide
information to the CODM. Further granularity, such as type of AMS contract, or type of Balance Sheet business
portfolio, is not how the business is managed or organised, and hence such further detail has not been presented
to the CODM, or in the segmental disclosures.

As part of the move to understand and provide more details over the segments under the integrated asset manager
model, further work has been completed to reallocate depreciation, amortisation and forex from the Group
functions to the relevant segments.

The intra-segment elimination column below removes charges made from the AMS business segment to the
Balance Sheet business segment and the FIM business segment on behalf of the Group for servicing and
collection of the Group and FIM’s portfolio investments and performance fees charged by the FIM business in
respect to its investments on behalf of the Group. The intra-segment charge is calculated on equivalent
commercial terms to charging third parties.

**6. Income from AMS and FIM**

**Asset management and servicing income**

Income from AMS contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a
customer. The Group recognises revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation related to a service it has
undertaken to provide to a customer.

Servicing income makes up the majority of AMS income, and in itself comprises a broad range of services,
including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realisation, legal title holding, due diligence
activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, securitisation vehicle set-up and ongoing
management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party
sub-servicer management.

In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time that corresponds to the satisfaction of the related
performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognised as the services
are provided to the customer, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract.

**Fund and investment management income**

Fund and investment management income encompasses services provided in relation to the discretionary and
semi-discretionary allocation and management of third-party capital. Fees for fund and investment management
services are normally calculated based on a fixed percentage of the value of assets managed and deducted from
the customer’s account balance on a regular basis. Income from fund and investment management services is
recognised over time as the services are provided.

**Contract balances**

At 31 December 2020, the Group had assets relating to contracts with customers in the amount of £8,765,000
(31 December 2019: £3,100,000). These assets fully relate to up-front costs which were incurred to acquire
customers within the Group’s Fund and Investment Management business, and will be released to the
comprehensive statement of profit and loss across the same period as the associated income will be recognised,
which is the lifetime of the related fund.

A key judgement made in recognising these costs which were incurred to acquire customers was whether or not
the investors in the fund met the definition of a customer in accordance with IFRS 15. Given the small number of
larger, institutional investors which were engaged with on an individual basis as part of the customer acquisition

process, this was deemed to meet the definition of a customer under IFRS 15 guidance. The weighted average
life remaining on these contract balances is 7 years and 9 months (31 December 2019: 8 years). The contract
balances have amortised in the period, resulting in a £655,000 of amortisation expensed to the comprehensive
statement of profit and loss during the year (2019: no impact).

The rate of UK corporation tax, as enacted under previous Finance Acts, was expected to reduce to 17% from
1 April 2020. The UK Government enacted legislation for the rate to remain at 19% and deferred tax recognised in
the UK has been restated accordingly, with a credit of £305,000 reflected during the year ended 31 December 2020.

In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands. Consequently, as of 1 January 2020,
the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands will be reduced from 25% to 21.7%. This change resulted in a gain of
€1,147,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group’s Dutch subsidiaries
being recognised during the year ended 31 December 2019. In September 2020, the Dutch Government
announced the reversal of this planned decrease, maintaining the rate at 25%. A credit of £1,147,000 has been
reflected in the year ended 31 December 2020, which reverses the prior year restatement.

**Deferred tax**

The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to losses of £27,683,000 (2019: £6,353,000), of which
£18,669,000 (2019: £nil) relate to the UK. The UK losses arose in the current period as a result of an impairment
of portfolio balances due to COVID-19. The underlying profitability of the Group has remained, and such losses
are expected to be utilised against future taxable profits.

The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £2,864,000 (2019: £2,634,000) of tax losses
carried forward, due to uncertainties over the future utilisation of the losses, including the future profitability of
the relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be available for offset against future profits and have no expiry date.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities.

The rate of UK corporation tax is expected to increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. Deferred taxation is measured
at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial
position date. As noted above, there is a significant UK deferred tax asset in relation to losses carried forward,
the restatement of which is expected to generate a statement of profit and loss tax credit once the applicable
legislation has been substantially enacted.

_Tax impact of the UK giving notice to withdraw from the EU_

Given that the UK has now exited the EU (at 31 January 2020), the Group has considered the impact of Brexit
from a tax perspective. The only impact foreseen is an increase in withholding tax (WHT) suffered on the
payment of interest and/or dividends from Portugal and Italy. Any WHT suffered is expected to be fully
creditable in the UK, with no cash tax impact from an overall group perspective (other than for timing purposes).

_Uncertainty over income tax treatments_

The current tax liability of £2,110,000 represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and
prior year periods, including a provision in relation to uncertain tax positions.

**11. Taxation continued**

As for most multi-nationals, the current tax environment is creating increasing levels of uncertainty and the
Group is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions. By their nature, these are often complex and
could take a significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. The Group estimates and accrues
taxes that will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed. The
levels of risk arising from tax audits may change as a result of legislative change, tax authority guidance or
practice and correspondence with the tax authorities during a specific audit. It is not possible to quantify the
impact that such future developments may have on the tax positions taken in the financial statements.

**13. Goodwill continued**

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit
from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to four aggregated CGUs on
the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes
and are not larger than the single operating segment defined under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments).

**Goodwill CGU allocation**

In relation to goodwill, the four CGUs identified are UK and Ireland, comprising all Group companies acquired
in the Capquest acquisition, Arrow Global Receivables Management Limited, Mars Capital, Bergen and
Drydens; Portugal, comprising all of the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar, Gesphone, Redrock and
Norfin acquisitions; Benelux, comprising all the Group companies acquired in the Vesting acquisition; and Italy,
comprising Zenith, Parr Credit and Europa Investimenti S.p.A. The UK and Ireland, Portugal, Benelux, and Italy
CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally from collections on acquired portfolio investments and
management and servicing of third-party debt.

Given the structure and operating model of the Group, it has been deemed appropriate to combine a number of
CGUs for impairment testing purposes. This is in line with the Group’s stated strategy of providing a range of
services in each geographic region in which the Group operates and represents the lowest level at which the
Group’s resources and assets are allocated internally.

The discount rate was a post-tax rate based on the yield of average European 10-year government bonds, adjusted
for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities generally and the systemic risk of the
specific CGU.

Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term growth rate into
perpetuity has been determined as the lower of the nominal gross domestic product rates for the countries in
which the CGU operates and the long-term compound annual profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation
growth rate estimated by management.

Budgeted profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation were based on expectations of future outcomes
taking into account past experience, adjusted for the anticipated revenue growth. Revenue growth was projected
taking into account the average growth levels experienced over the past five years and the estimated growth for
the next five years.

The key assumptions described above may change as economic and market conditions change. The Group
estimates that likely possible changes in these assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of any CGU
to decline below the carrying amount.

The Group’s goodwill balance has been assessed and no part of the overall balance is deemed to be deductible for
tax purposes.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:

**13. Goodwill continued**

An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2020 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The
goodwill was assessed to be appropriately stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGUs is
determined as the higher of fair value, less cost to sell and value in use. Discount rate and forward-looking
growth assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were as follows:

2020 2019

UK and Ireland Portugal Benelux Italy UK and Ireland Portugal Benelux Italy

Discount rate % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **8.9%** **9.3%** **8.4%** **9.4%** 8.6% 9.0% 8.2% 9.0%

forecasts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.0%** **2.2%** **2.0%** **1.7%** 2.0% 2.2% 2.0% 1.7%

**Discount rates**

Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Post-tax rates are used alongside post-tax cash flows, as the
post-tax discount rate is more readily derived from observable market information. Any potential differences
between post-tax discount rates and cash flows and the pre-tax method under IAS 36 – Impairment of assets have
been considered, and no material differences between approaches have been identified.

The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) and adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate.
The factors took into account the risks inherent in each of the CGUs; such as currency, regulatory, and economic
risks and the different operations in the CGUs were also considered.

In determining the appropriate WACC to use in the current impairment test, in line with advice from experts,
management took into account both the current and target leverage structure of the Group, as well as
pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 market conditions. An average of these approaches provided a balanced
view of the appropriate discount rate to use for the value in use calculation in the midst of the uncertainty created
by COVID-19.

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management
for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in
collection activity which in turn drive forecast collections and cost figures. These assumptions are in keeping
with the directors’ expectations of future growth. Appropriate tax rates are applied to the cash flow forecasts for
each CGU. The analysis has been prepared using post-tax cash flows and discount rates, as post-tax discount
rates can be more readily derived from observable market data. The Group is satisfied that this is materially equal
to performing the analysis on pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.

The result of the goodwill impairment review was that no impairment was deemed to exist as at 31 December
2020. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis over the key inputs used in the impairment test of the
CGU’s carrying value. The CGUs would become impaired based on a net post-tax cash flow reduction set out
below, or based on an increase in the discount rate noted below:

Deferred consideration on acquisition of subsidiaries has reduced as amounts were repaid in the period, alongside
remeasurements of deferred contingent consideration liabilities in the period which reduced their value. Deferred
consideration on portfolio investments have decreased in the period as significantly less portfolio acquisitions
had an element of deferred consideration outstanding at 31 December 2020 than 31 December 2019.

Included within other liabilities is €3,361,000 (£3,043,000) (2019: €2,463,000 (£2,095,000)) relating to deferred pay
for the Italian employees. The employees are part of statutory indemnity schemes, compulsory by law, that entitles
them to deferred pay, typically at the end of their employment, the ‘Trattamento di fine rapport’ (TFR). A liability is
recognised to reflect that the indemnity will be paid at a future date, when the employees leave employment. The
liability is included within trade and other payables on the statement of financial position and is calculated by an
independent expert through an actuarial valuation, the key assumptions used are detailed below:

**18. Contingent liabilities**

Through the ordinary course of business, the Group exposes itself to potential liabilities which at present it is not
aware of, and may or may not arise in the future. As such, it would not be practical to try and quantify their
future financial impact. However, set out below are broad areas of the Group’s ordinary business activities which
may in the future lead to potential claims or liabilities being incurred by the Group.

**Conduct and regulatory compliance**

Given the high level of scrutiny regarding financial institutions’ treatment of customers and business conduct
from regulatory bodies, the media and politicians, there is a possibility that certain aspects of the current or
historic business, including, amongst other things, collections practices and general treatment of customers, may
be determined by the FCA and other regulatory bodies or the courts as, in their opinion, not being conducted in
accordance with applicable laws or regulations, or fair and reasonable treatment.

**Contractual disputes**

In carrying out its ongoing business, the Group enters into numerous contracts in any given year with a various
third-party entities. There is always a risk that a contractual dispute may arise in the future, which may lead to a
claim against the Group in respect of any damages or losses incurred by the third party.

**Own shares**

Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The Company has an
employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.

Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds
and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the financial statements on
transactions in treasury shares.

In line with the Group’s near-term focus in Q1 2020, being the preservation of cash and liquidity, on the 6 April
2020, the Group announced its intention to withdraw its recommended final dividend for 2019, preserving
approximately £15.0 million of cash within the business.

The board has also not paid an interim dividend for H1 2020, however it expects to resume dividend payments at
year-end 2021.

**21. Leases**

The Group has leases for offices and production vehicles. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of
low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability. The Group classifies its right-of-use assets in a consistent manner to its property, plant and equipment
(see note 15).

Leases of vehicles are usually limited to a lease term of two to four years. Leases of property generally have a
lease term ranging from five years to ten years. Lease payments are generally fixed, however there are a limited
number of property leases where rentals are linked to annual changes in an index (either the retail price index or
consumer price index).

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset
to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Leases are either non-cancellable or may
only be cancelled by incurring a substantive termination fee. Some leases contain an option to purchase the
underlying leased asset outright at the end of the lease, or to extend the lease for a further term. The Group is
prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security. For leases over office buildings the
Group must keep those properties in a good state of repair and return the properties in their original condition at
the end of the lease. Further, the Group must insure items of property, plant and equipment and incur
maintenance fees on such items in accordance with the lease contracts.

The material receivable balance due from subsidiary undertakings from Arrow Global One Limited relates
primarily to final dividends declared by Arrow Global One Limited in 2018. In the current period, the movement
in this balance relate primarily to interest being charged on the loan. Balances relate to intercompany loans that
are repayable on demand, with this being the longest contractual period and are, therefore, held as current
liabilities or assets.

As a loan repayable on demand, expected credit losses were estimated on the assumption that repayment of the
loan is demanded at the reporting date. It was assessed that loan was not in default as (i) the repayment had not
been demanded, and (ii) the subsidiary was considered to be performing.

The maximum period over which expected impairment losses were measured was the period needed to transfer
the cash once demanded.

As at 31 December 2020, Arrow Global One Limited could repay the outstanding balance of the receivable in
full within three months, with the majority of the payment being received immediately. Accordingly there is no
material expected credit loss.

During the year, there were no other related party transactions other than discussed above.

- Subsidiaries which have chosen to take the subsidiary companies audit exemption permitted by section 479c of the Companies Act 2006,
with Arrow Global Group plc providing a declaration of guarantee.

All subsidiaries are included in the Group consolidation, including where the Group does not own 100% of the
ordinary shares of the Company. This may arise where the Group exercises control over the relevant activity of
the entity and can use this control to impact the variability of returns from the entity. The Group, at times, must
exercise judgement as to whether the combination of control and exposure to variability of returns arising from
an entity means it is acting primarily as an agent, or as a principal for its own interests and should therefore
consolidate the entity into the results of the Group. There have been no instances in the period where significant
judgement was applied to reach a conclusion over whether or not an entity should be consolidated or not. The
Group did not consolidate any entity which individually had material non-controlling interest balances, and, as
such, no further disclosure on non-controlling interests have been provided in this note.

Transfer between categories represents positions where the Group has originally held one type of instrument
relating to a portfolio, and subsequently increased or changed its interest in the portfolio, leading to the
requirement to consolidate the underlying structure onto the Group’s balance sheet. This leads to a change in the
classification of the portfolio investment held. The ‘portfolio restructure’ represents the restructure of a leveraged
structured deal to move to a de-levered position, and hence change the nature of the holding whilst extinguishing
related liabilities. Note that for real estate inventories, which are not financial instruments, the balance sheet cash
collections figure above is analogous to total sales of inventories, and the net of balance sheet cash collections
and income from portfolio investments – real estate inventories, is analogous to cost of sales of inventories. Sales
of inventories are accounted for as revenue under IFRS 15, as they are not financial instruments, but are
presented alongside the other portfolio investments for ease of reference.

**Incorporation of forward-looking information**

Note 4 includes a description of how the future cash flows are estimated for the Group’s portfolio investments.
Additionally, the Group incorporates forward-looking information in the measurement of portfolio investments
held at amortised cost. The Group formulates three economic scenarios: a base case, which is the central
scenario, developed based on consensus forecasts, and two less likely scenarios – one upside and one downside
scenario.

These scenarios are calculated by an external and independent macroeconomic forecasting company and are
reviewed internally before being used in the Group’s models. To derive these scenarios, multiple sources of
information are considered, including economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and
monetary authorities in the countries where the Group operates, supranational organisations such as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund, and
selected private-sector and academic forecasts.

The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk for its portfolio investments and, using an
analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and
credit losses. The key drivers for credit risk for portfolio investments are: HPI’s and unemployment rates, with
all countries using the international labour organisation definition across countries. For exposures to specific
regions, the key drivers also include relevant real estate prices.

**Scenario modelling information**

To assist with the understanding of how the Group has modelled the future cash flows which ultimately drive the
valuation of the portfolio investment assets, the below table shows the probability that has been assigned to each
macroeconomic scenario when preparing the cash flow forecasts. Note that the comparatives for 2019 have not
been presented alongside the 2020 scenario modelling information, as the approach to incorporating forward
looking macroeconomic forecasts has been refined in the current year.

In conjunction with the scenario probability, the information set out below can be used to determine the Group’s
expected range of macroeconomic environments, along with the probability-weighted average environment for
each key segment and indicator. Note that where a HPI forecast is shown, these are calculated relative to the
relevant pre-COVID 31 December 2019 position in the index (where pre-COVID is equal to 100%), therefore the
trough in the table below might be before or after the 30 December 2020. Unemployment forecasts represent
absolute levels of unemployment as a percentage of population.

**Key sensitivities**

The estimated future cash flows generated by portfolio investments are the key estimates/judgements in these
financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by -1/+1% would impact the closing carrying
value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2020 by £9,700,000 (31 December 2019: £11,020,000).
Note that this sensitivity applies only to ‘amortised cost’ and ‘FVTPL’ portfolio investments, as this is not a
critical estimate for real estate portfolio assets.

A key input into the estimate of future cash flows is the probability assigned to each of the ‘base’, ‘downside’
and ‘severe’ cases. If 100% probability was assigned to the most optimistic/pessimistic scenario, the impact is
shown in the below table, split by geography and asset class. Note that this sensitivity applies only to ‘amortised

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments**

**Risk management**

_Credit risk_

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of non-performing and non-core consumer and
commercial unsecured, secured and real estate portfolios. Most portfolios by their nature are impaired at
acquisition and the Group continually monitors balance sheet cash collections that in turn inform the ERCs on
which the portfolio carrying value is calculated. The ongoing risk is managed through a portfolio valuation
process including modelling current expectations of recoverability based on historical information of debt types,
also factoring in sale recoveries from collateral held on the secured portfolios. Further details of the forecasting
process are given in note 4.ii.

An investment credit committee process is in place to approve investments on the Arrow balance sheet and in
respect of Arrow’s participation in fund investments through its separately managed account, which includes at
least two members of the executive committee as well as other key members from relevant areas of the business,
including oversight by the risk management function. The Group also monitors its exposure to geographic
concentration of assets. This process exists to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational
and regulatory risk through to the financial assumptions and maximum bid price.

Where portfolio investments are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, as part of the regular
monitoring process, the future cash flows in the ERCs are updated, with impairment gains/losses as a result of
changes to the estimated cash flows discounted at the EIR rate. Where portfolio investments are measured at
FVTPL, they are measured using a discounted cash flow model.

With the introduction of IFRS 9 in 2018, the Group’s management of credit risk is now further enhanced through
the modelling of multiple economic scenarios and the impact this is expected to have on future balance sheet
cash collections performance. All of the Group’s portfolio investments have been classified as POCI, due to their
credit-impaired nature at the date of purchase. Therefore, no consideration has been given to the staging
requirements of IFRS 9 for the Group’s portfolio assets.

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

In the UK, the Group constructed its own proprietary data repository in 2005 and has added additional historic
data on credit performance in the markets in which it operates. It now has tens of millions of records. This is used
to inform balance sheet cash collections strategies and to help establish affordable repayment plans and
settlements with our customers across all geographies. Given the nature of the portfolios the Group purchases,
most arrangements entered into with our customers are of a non-contractual nature, where we work to establish,
or re-establish, suitable payment plans that are affordable and sustainable.

The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management
framework. The Group’s day-to-day working capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents.

**Credit quality analysis**

The Group’s purchased portfolio investments have been classified as purchased or originated as credit impaired
(POCI) as they include financial instruments that were credit-impaired at initial recognition, irrespective of
whether they are still credit-impaired at the reporting date. Expected credit losses (ECL) against POCI exposures
are always calculated on a lifetime basis (cumulative changes in ECL since initial recognition), and are reflected
in the credit-adjusted effective interest rate at initial recognition. As a result, no loss allowance is recognised at
inception. Subsequently, any changes in lifetime ECL after initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss.
The ECL calculation for POCI assets is based on an ECL over 84-months.

In determining ECLs, the assessment of forward-looking economic assumptions, which are sourced from an
independent specialist forecasting company, the Group considers a number of macroeconomic scenarios,
including assumptions on unemployment, interest rates and CPI, and where appropriate, HPI. These scenarios are
probability weighted according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios include a central scenario, based on the
current economic environment, as well as upside and downside scenarios. The estimation and application of this
forward-looking information requires significant judgement and is subject to appropriate internal governance.

Impairment gains/losses are changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt
portfolios as a result of reassessments of their estimated future cash flows and are recognised in the line item
‘impairment gains on portfolio investments at amortised cost’. There are generally no credit risk mitigants
relating to the Group’s unsecured portfolio investments.

As all of the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets are POCI, the cash flows are subject to reassessment each
period. For any portfolios that may be sold to a third party from time to time, these are first subject to a cash flow
reassessment. Expected cash flows in such a scenario would be linked to the likely sale proceeds, meaning that
all such assets would be written to their expected selling price via an impairment gain/loss, before being sold.

The following tables sets out information about the credit quality of financial assets measured at amortised cost.

Portfolio balances are based on the customer’s country of domicile.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on portfolio investments is considered equal to the current
carrying balance of such portfolio investments.

**Information on collateral held against amortised cost secured loans**

The following table stratifies credit exposures from secured portfolio investments held at amortised cost by
ranges of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. LTV is calculated as the ratio of the gross amount of the loan – or the
amount committed for loan commitments – to the value of the collateral. The valuation of the collateral excludes
any adjustments for obtaining and selling the collateral. The value of the collateral is based on the most recent
appraisals. LTV stratification is deemed a more relevant measure of the value of collateral held against secured
loans than gross collateral values held, which may include an amount which is not due to the Group upon
realisation.

**Other types of credit enhancements**

In addition to the collateral included in the tables above, the Group holds other types of collateral and credit
enhancements, such as second charges and floating charges for which specific values are not generally available.

**Assets obtained by taking possession of collateral**

There have been no instances of financial or non-financial assets, obtained by the Group during the year, by
taking possession of collateral held as security against portfolio investments.

The Group’s policy is to pursue timely realisation of the collateral in an orderly manner. The Group does not
generally use the non-cash collateral for its own operation.

**Significant increase in credit risk**

There are no significant increases or decreases in credit risk since origination as all portfolio investments have
been deemed to be purchased or originated credit impaired on initial recognition.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

As part of credit risk, the Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on
deposit with banks and foreign currency and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk with debt sellers
is managed through contractual arrangements and warranties.

The Group generally deposits cash and undertakes currency and derivative transactions with highly rated banks,
with limits on the level of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used
with board approval.

No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial derivatives. The maximum credit risk on
derivatives and trade receivables is the full carrying amount. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as
follows:

The table represents a worst-case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to. The 31 December
2020 balance is spread across a number of counterparties with the top five accounting for 65% of the total (2019:
44%). The maximum exposure to one counterparty is £75 million (2019: £16 million). The 2019 balance has been
re-presented to include £26,611,000 of cash which may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be
remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitisation structure awaiting a payment date. See note 16 on page F-73
for more detail.

The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institution counterparties whose external credit
ratings, by either S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s Investor Service, are as follows:

**Treasury-related risks**

The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board
delegates certain responsibilities to the asset and liability committee, which is chaired by the Group chief
financial officer, and is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority. Treasury activities and
compliance with treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic
independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main
financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and market
risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the Group is properly funded, that
financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risks are managed
within set limits. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.

The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency
contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the
Group’s business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken, and written options may
only be used when matched by purchased options. No written options were entered into during 2020 (2019: £nil).

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by cash or another financial asset.

The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business
and its future plans for growth. The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a
specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities and cash and cash equivalents to meet
contractual maturities on borrowing facilities plus an operational headroom. In addition, the Group aims to
ensure that leverage is within the target range of 3.0 to 3.5 times, there is an appropriate refinancing profile with
phased maturity dates and it has diversified funding sources with no over-reliance on a single or small group of
lenders or type of funding. At 31 December 2020, the Group’s senior secured notes, revolving credit facility and
asset-backed security transaction had an average period to maturity of 3.7 years (2019: 4.8 years). Total cash and
undrawn facilities, which excludes cash that may be subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be
remitted, were £174.6 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: £152.9 million).

The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review
meetings. Management has well-established models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this
represents a key performance indicator of the business. The Group is highly cash generative with regular cash
receipts and portfolio purchases (except forward flows) are discretionary, which helps to mitigate liquidity risk.

The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is liquidity headroom, which includes cash and
cash equivalents and the headroom under the two committed facilities, being the revolving credit facility and the
asset-backed security facility. Liquidity headroom excludes cash which may be subject to constraints regarding
when the balance can be remitted, such as cash in a consolidated securitisation structure awaiting a payment date.
Details of the liquidity headroom as at the reporting date and during the reporting period were as follows:

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

As part of the management of liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, the Group holds liquid assets
comprising cash and cash equivalents which can be readily used to meet liquidity requirements. In addition, the
Group maintains agreed lines of credit with other banks.

For more detail on the cash and cash equivalents re-presentation, see note 31 on page F-112.

The non-derivative financial liabilities and financial assets are calculated based upon the undiscounted cash
flows, which include estimated interest payments. The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for
borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where borrowings are subject to a
floating rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the
statement of financial position date.

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined with reference to
the projected interest rates as illustrated by the interest rate yield curves existing at the statement of financial
position date.

The derivative financial instruments are held across a number of counterparties; the largest net cash flow
exposure to a single counterparty at 31 December 2020 is £0.03 million (2019: £0.2 million).

**Financial assets pledged as collateral**

See note 29 on page F-108 for more information.

**Market risk**

Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk and are
considered further below. Note that the Group does not hold any trading portfolios for the purposes of these
disclosures.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on its borrowings, principally
on the floating rate senior secured notes, and therefore seeks to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of
techniques to fix interest rate costs, including fixed-rate funding (predominantly longer-term bond funding), bank
borrowing loan draw down periods and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the
interest rate costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time. Most hedging is for up to three
years.

**Exposure to interest rate risk**

The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of
the Group is as follows:

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:

- the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative
financial instruments;

- where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging
instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates; and

- changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

**Currency risk**

The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income
statement exposure.

**Cash flow exposure**

The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are
highly likely to arise in the following 12 months. Where cash flow hedges have been entered into, they are
designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.

**Net asset exposure**

A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The Group limits its exposure to currency risk
on non-functional funding through forward currency contracts. The statement of financial position is reported in
Sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the
net assets of the Group. The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in Euro by funding
portfolio assets with Euro denominated borrowings where possible.

**Income statement exposure**

As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in Euro but translated into Sterling for
reporting purposes. The result for the period is translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk
therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative to the Euro will have an impact on the
consolidated result for the period. This risk is managed by the Group matching Euro asset purchases with Euro
funding wherever possible, to achieve an element of natural hedging.

If foreign exchange rates had been 10% stronger than Sterling than those at the statement of financial position
date and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net assets and net profit for each significant
denomination of currency would increase as follows:


2019
£000

**298** 9,800

The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are
naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability).

**(244)** (8,018)

The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are
naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability).

**Capital risk management**

The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the
business. The Group is currently not required to hold regulatory capital but seeks to maintain leverage (calculated
as secured net debt over Adjusted EBITDA) of between 3.0 and 3.5 times. During the impacts of COVID-19,
leverage increased to 5.1 times as at 31 December 2020, above the target range.

The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong statement of financial position but at
the same time is providing a good return on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure
that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash, cash equivalents debt and equity.

Management reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis. As part of this review, management considers the
cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group’s position as at 31 December 2020 was:

**Fair value estimation**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted
market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values
using other valuation techniques.

For instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and required
judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other
risks affecting the specific instrument.

**Valuation models**

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the
inputs used in making the measurements.

Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments.

F-97


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**26. Financial assets and liabilities continued**

Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in
active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are
considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly
observable from market data.

Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique
includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar
instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect the differences
between the instruments.

**Application to the Group’s financial assets and liabilities**

The fair value of amortised cost portfolio investments has been calculated by observing the compression in
market yields over time and applying the difference between current average market IRRs for the Group’s most
recent vintage, and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach takes into
account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the consideration of the individual
characteristics of each portfolio. As this calculation is based on unobservable inputs, these fair values would be
categorised as level 3 values. The primary unobservable input to which this valuation is sensitive to is the current
market rates for portfolios. A 1% rise/fall in this rate would lead to a reduction/uplift in fair value of
£(12,192,000)/£12,636,000.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and the revolving credit facility are deemed to be equal to their
carrying amount.

The carrying value of other receivables and payables classified as financial assets/liabilities is deemed to be a
good approximation of their fair value, due to their short maturity and low credit risk. These would be considered
as level 3 fair values.

The carrying value of asset-backed loans is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Given the
significant collateral underpinning the asset-backed loans, it is deemed appropriate to not adjust the carrying
value for expected credit losses when deriving the fair value of the loans. Additionally, the market rate is not
deemed to have materially changed since the issuance of the asset-backed loans. The fair value would be
categorised as a level 3 value.

The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes that are based on
observable market inputs and therefore would be included as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy table should the
liability have been held at fair value.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as
a result of the derivative transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature,
the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

**Financial instruments measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy**

The following table analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the
fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values

There have been no transfers between level 2 or level 3. However, it has been determined that contingent
consideration liabilities qualify as level 3 financial liabilities held at FVTPL. As such, they are now included
within this disclosure.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows
using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 2020.

Total gains on portfolio investments recognised at FVTPL have been presented in the income statement as ‘Fair
value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL’. The fair value of portfolio investments recognised as FVTPL
has been calculated by using a discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the
calculation of portfolio investments categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy are estimated future cash
flows (ERCs) derived from management forecasts and the discount rate appropriate to the investment and the
anticipated rate of return.

The total 84-month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £249,551,000, with an
average discount rate of 13.1%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £1,874,000/ (£1,874,000). An increase/decrease in the
discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at
FVTPL of (£3,543,000)/£3,664,000.

The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is £1,169,286,000, with an
average discount rate of 21.5%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £7,936,000/(£7,936,000). An increase/decrease
in the discount rate of 1% would lead to a decrease/increase in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at
amortised of (£12,192,000)/£12,636,000. A full reconciliation between the opening and closing portfolio
investments held at FVTPL has been provided in note 24. For a fuller description of how the future cash flows
are estimated, please refer to note 4.

The reconciliation of portfolio investments held at FVTPL can be seen as part of the total portfolio investments
reconciliation table in note 24 on page F-83.

Contingent consideration has arisen as a result of business combinations in the prior periods. Of the remaining 2020
balance, £475,000 relates to the acquisition of Drydens and has a minimum/maximum pay-out of £nil/£500,000. In

2019, the contingent consideration was remeasured, partly due to the renegotiation of the terms of the deferred
consideration in the period. Of the closing balance in 2019, €10 million relates to the acquisition of Norfin and has a
minimum/maximum pay-out of €5 million/€10 million (subject to the performance of the business). The remainder
relates to the acquisition of Drydens, with a minimum/maximum pay-out of £nil/£5 million (subject to the
performance of the business).

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy**

The following table analyses financial instruments not measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in
the fair value hierarchy into which the measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values
recognised in the statement of financial position.

**Forward foreign exchange contracts**

It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency
payments, receipts and exposure to currency rate fluctuations. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign
currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2020 is £nil (2019: nil). During the year, £nil
(2019: £8,000) was recycled from equity to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,
within finance costs, as a result of maturity of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year and an
amount of £nil has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2019:
£100,000).

There have been no transfers in or out of level 3. However, it has been determined that deferred consideration
liabilities qualify as level 3 financial liabilities held at amortised cost. The statement of financial position value
of the Group’s portfolio investments not measured at fair value, is derived from discounted cash flows generated
by an internal model. For a fuller description of how the future cash flows are estimated, please refer to note 4.
Following acquisition, the fair value will move directionally in line with carrying amount but may deviate as
market conditions change.

The Group has an established control framework covering the measurement of portfolio investment carrying
values. This includes regular monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee,
which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a semiannual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, approves the latest ERC forecast, assesses the
carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition. A reconciliation of the opening to closing
balances for the year of the portfolio investments can be seen in note 24.

The Company did not hold any other financial instruments not measured at fair value for which a fair value needs
to be calculated (2019: none).

**Interest rate hedging**

The Group has Euro interest rate swaps, which hedge floating 3-month Euribor with a zero percent floor to a
fixed rate and have been designated as cash flow hedges, in place for a Sterling equivalent notional amount of
£161,734,000 (2019: £340,237,000). In 2019 and 2020, these interest rate swaps covered current borrowings,
being the floating rate senior secured Euro notes. An amount of £427,000 has been credited to equity for the
Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2019: £286,000 credit). All hedge relationships have been
effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed based upon the relative changes in cash flows arising from the specified portion
of the Group’s floating rate borrowings, relative to the change in cash flows of the interest rate swaps (using the
hypothetical derivative method). The hedges are deemed to be highly effective in the current and prior period. In
such hedge relationships, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is counterparty credit risk, of both
parties, including the Group. There are no other material sources of hedge ineffectiveness.

Interest rate swaps in place at the statement of financial position date are designated, and are effective under
IFRS 9, as cash flow hedges, and their fair value has been recognised in the hedging reserve. All interest rate
swaps are categorised as highly effective and no ineffectiveness charge has been made to the statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income in the year (2019: no charge). No re-classifications into or out of the
hedging reserve were made in relation to interest rate swaps.

The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: £nil). The interest
payable and receivable under the interest rate swaps are expenses directly to the statement of profit and loss and
no charge has been made to the Company’s equity.

The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and
Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to Euribor under the European Union Benchmarks
Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor after 1 January 2020 for both existing and
new contracts. The Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable
future. The Group does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. For these reasons, the
Group does not consider its cash flow hedges of the Euribor benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by the
interest rate benchmark reform at 31 December 2020. No hedge relationships have any exposure to LIBOR.

At 31 December 2020, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates.

**27. Unconsolidated structured entities**

Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that the Group has an interest in, but does not
control. The Group uses structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate acquisitions of portfolios
in accordance with local law, to allow co-investment with other parties, or to implement the financing required to
acquire portfolios.

In addition to exposures to unconsolidated structured entities, the Group also undertakes Asset Management and
Servicing activities for certain structured entities in which the Group has no other interests. Such activities are
charged at a market rates, on terms normal for the industry, and are considered to be a typical customer/supplier
relationship per the meaning of this term set out in ‘IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’.

The maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of the instruments summarised above, due to the nature of
the Group’s holdings at the fact that no additional support has been provided or committed to the vehicles.

Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group holds an interest are typically financed by a form of junior
profit participation note, and in some instances also have senior secured or senior unsecured liabilities to which
the junior positions are subordinated.

**28. Share-based payments – Group and Company**

**Share incentive plan (SIP)**

In 2020 (and previously April 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014), the Company offered to all UK
employees the opportunity to participate in a SIP, where the Company gives the participating employees one
matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using the participating employees’
gross salaries. The shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees
required to stay in employment for the vesting period to receive the shares.

On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant
date price per share of £2.29 as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vested in 2017, with
restrictions attached to these shares ceasing to have effect from the vesting date.

**Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)**

On 25 June 2020, nil-cost share options and conditional awards were granted to eligible employees based on a
maximum of 200% of base salary. The LTIP awards vest at the end of three years, subject to the achievement of
performance conditions.

On 20 June 2019, nil-cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 200% of
base salary. The LTIP awards vest at the end of three years subject to the achievement of performance
conditions. On the same dates, tax-qualifying options were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’)
to eligible UK employees.

On 27 June 2018, 31 March 2017, 8 April 2016 and 19 May 2016, 30 June 2015 and 15 June 2015, nil-cost share
options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. The LTIP awards vest
at the end of three years subject to the achievement of performance conditions. On the same dates, CSOP options
were granted as part of the LTIP awards to eligible UK employees.

Each CSOP option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If
a CSOP option is exercised at a gain, the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated
nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced at exercise by the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value
of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant of the CSOP option.

Awards granted on or after 27 June 2018 awards do not include the right to receive a dividend equivalent.

**2020 LTIP award criteria**

For each eligible employee, 33.3% of the LTIP awards are subject to the following ROE criteria:

Performance condition Percentage vesting

**Senior secured notes**

The senior secured notes comprise three publicly issued Euro and Sterling senior notes secured by substantially
all of the assets of the Group; £320 million 5.125% fixed-rate notes due September 2024, €400 million floating
rate senior secured notes due April 2025 at a coupon of 3.75% over three-month Euribor and €285 million
floating rate senior secured notes due March 2026 at a coupon of 3.75% over three-month Euribor. The Euro
notes are subject to a zero percent floor on Euribor.

**Revolving credit facility**

On 26 February 2019, the £285 million revolving credit facility was extended to 2024, with no change to the
2.5% margin.

On 12 August 2020, the Group executed an amendment agreement with its lenders under the revolving credit
facility to amend the financial covenants under the facility to reflect the potential impact on the business of
COVID-19. The amendments to the financial covenants are for the period from September 2020 up to and
including June 2022 and provide suitable headroom based upon the Group’s downside projections, including an
amendment to the maximum permitted leverage and minimum liquidity, and a move to a more dynamic margin
calculation.

**Asset-backed securitisation**

On 30 April 2019, the Group entered into a £100 million non-recourse committed asset-backed securitisation
facility with an advance rate of 55% of 84-month ERC. On the same date, the Group sold £137 million of ERC
into AGL Fleetwood Limited, a wholly owned Arrow Global Group subsidiary, and borrowed an initial amount
of £75 million non-recourse funding at LIBOR plus 3.1%, under the facility.

**29. Borrowings and facilities continued**

On 31 July 2019, the Group sold a further £44 million of ERC into AGL Fleetwood Limited and subsequently
borrowed an additional £25 million non-recourse funding on the same terms under the facility.

On 31 March 2020, the Group sold a further £30 million of ERC into AGL Fleetwood Limited and on 2 April
2020 borrowed an additional £21 million non-recourse funding on the same terms under the facility. As at 2 April
2020, the amount drawn under the facility was £100 million. The facility had a five-year term comprising an
initial two-year revolving period followed by a three-year amortising period with an option to extend the
revolving period by one-year subject to lender consent.

During July 2020, the Group entered into further arrangements in connection with the non-recourse facility to
mitigate potential balance sheet cash collections impacts of COVID-19. An additional £33 million of 84-month
ERC was sold into the structure with no additional borrowings made. In consideration of the additional ERC
pledged, the lender agreed to amend certain performance criteria.

During July 2020, a second non-recourse amortising loan of €104,700,000 was fully drawn during the month.
The second loan was secured against €356 million of Portuguese 84-month ERC at a margin of 4.25%.

As at 31 December 2020, £299,117,000 of the portfolio investments, set out in note 24, are pledged as collateral
for the asset-backed securitisations.

**Current year acquisitions**

There were no acquisitions during the year to 31 December 2020.

**Prior year acquisition**

_Drydens Limited (Drydens)_

On 8 April 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Drydens. Drydens is a provider of legal
services, the acquisition of which will broaden the Group’s UK range of servicing capabilities and skills across
consumer and commercial litigation, probate and insolvency. The total undiscounted consideration for the
acquisition is £11,115,000 including deferred and contingent consideration.

**30. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued**

Contingent consideration is payable at various times within two years from completion of the transaction upon
the satisfaction of three mutually exclusive conditions which are based upon the business achieving certain
targets around future volumes and the successful migration of Group accounts. The targets for contingent
consideration are not linked to the post-acquisition employment status of the sellers, and is not considered to be a
post-employment benefit arrangement with the former owners.

Of the £4,262,000 contingent consideration, the gross undiscounted amounts are made up as follows:

 - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the successful migration of Arrow accounts. The payment range could
be anywhere between £nil and £2,000,000 with the final amount to be agreed upon in April 2020;

 - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the performance of Arrow placed accounts against the jointly agreed
business plan. The payment range could be anywhere between £nil and £2,000,000 with the final amount to
be agreed upon in April 2021; and

 - £1,000,000 is contingent upon winning Proceeds of Crime Act servicing deal from the UK Government
before 8 April 2020. If the deal is not won the payment is forfeited.

**Effect of the acquisition**

The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.
Acquisition related costs are expensed in the profit or loss in the reporting period:

An intangible asset of £688,000 has been recognised at acquisition, being the fair value after appropriate
discounting, of expected cash flows arising from existing customer relationships. The gross contractual
outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ were materially equal to their carrying amount, with no
material balances not expected to be collected upon.

Goodwill of £14,519,000 was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reason for the acquisition was to
broaden the Group’s range of servicing capabilities in the UK.

**30. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued**

In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2019, Drydens contributed income of £3,650,000 and profit after
tax contribution of £1,165,000 to the consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on
1 January 2019, Group total income would have been higher by an estimated £1,167,000 and profit after tax
would have been lower by an estimated £24,000.

means that all terms and conditions of the new bonds are identical to those of the existing 2026 bonds, except for
the issue price. The proceeds from the transaction of €74,250,000 less transaction fees and expenses will be used
to partially repay drawings under the Group’s revolving credit facility.

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**

**1. Our opinion is unmodified**

We have audited the financial statements of Arrow Global Group plc (“the Company”) for the year ended
31 December 2019 which comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss & other comprehensive income,
consolidated & parent company statement of financial position, consolidated & parent company statement of
changes in equity, consolidated & parent company statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including the
accounting policies in note 3.

**In our opinion:**

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);

- the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient
and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.

We were first appointed as auditor by the directors on 2 July 2014. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is
for the 6 financial years ended 31 December 2019. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we
remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard
as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.

allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the
key audit matters in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those
matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were
addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of,
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are
incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Unprecedented levels of uncertainty:**

All audits assess and challenge the
reasonableness of estimates, in particular as
described in ‘Estimation of future cash
collections from portfolio investments’
below, and related disclosures and the
appropriateness of the going concern basis
of preparation of the financial statements
(see below). All of these depend on
assessments of the future economic
environment and the Group’s future
prospects and performance.

In addition, we are required to consider the
other information presented in the Annual
Report including the principal risks
disclosure and the viability statement and
to consider the Directors’ statement that the
annual report and financial statements
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the
information necessary for shareholders to
assess the Group’s position and
performance, business model and strategy.

Brexit is one of the most significant
economic events for the UK and its effects
are subject to unprecedented levels of
uncertainty of consequences, with the full
range of possible effects unknown.

F-114


We developed a standardised firm-wide
approach to the consideration of the
uncertainties arising from Brexit in
planning and performing our audits. Our
procedures included:

- **Our Brexit knowledge: We**
considered the directors’ assessment
of Brexit-related sources of risk for
the Group’s business and financial
resources compared with our own
understanding of the risks. We
considered the Directors’ plans to take
action to mitigate the risks;

- **Sensitivity analysis: When addressing**
‘Estimation of future cash collections
from portfolio investments’ and other
areas that depend on forecasts, we
compared the Directors’ analysis to our
assessment of the full range of
reasonably possible scenarios resulting
from Brexit uncertainty and, where
forecast cash flows are required to be
discounted, considered adjustments to
discount rates for the level of
remaining uncertainty;

- **Assessing transparency: As well as**
assessing individual disclosures as part
of our procedures on estimation of
future cash collections from portfolio
investments we considered all of the
Brexit related disclosures together,
including those in the strategic report,
comparing the overall picture against
our understanding of the risks;

**Our results**

- As reported under ‘Estimation of future
cash collections from portfolio
investments’, we found the resulting
estimates and related disclosures of the
impact of uncertainties due to the UK
exiting the European Union and
disclosures in relation to going concern
to be acceptable. However, no audit
should be expected to predict the
unknowable factors or all possible future
implications for a company and this is
particularly the case in relation to Brexit.

**Forecast based valuation:**

The Group’s estimate of the remaining
future cash collections (ERCs) from
portfolio investments is the key variable in
determining the portfolio carrying amount
and any subsequent revenue adjustments.
Portfolio investments comprise of
amortised cost portfolios, fair value
portfolios and real estate owned
inventories.

The Group uses cash flow forecasting
models to calculate an initial estimate of
future collections. The assumptions used in
the models include the value, probability
and timing of ERCs for each type of asset
class within a portfolio or at a portfolio
level. These estimates are subject to
ongoing review by management to assess
reasonableness, comparing observed
performance against previous forecasts.

Given the diverse nature of the Group’s
Portfolio Investments, estimation of future
cash collections for more bespoke assets
involves a greater degree of management
judgement. Dependent on the level of
complexity of the asset, management use
various forecasting models to derive the
ERCs.

The ERCs are most sensitive to
management’s strategy in managing the
portfolios (e.g. changes in collection
policies or use of specialist collectors). Due
to the level of subjectivity inherent in the
assumptions used in the cash flow
forecasting models this is a key judgement
area for our audit.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of
our risk assessment, we determined that
estimation of future cash collections from
Portfolio Investments has a high degree of
estimation uncertainty, with a potential
range of reasonable outcomes greater than
our materiality for the financial statements
as a whole.

F-115


Our procedures included:

- **Controls design: We assessed the**
design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of controls over data
used in the cash flow forecasting
models including monitoring of debt
servicer collections, reconciliations of
system cash collected to actual
receipts, and general IT controls over
the collection systems driving the
estimated future cash flows;

- **Governance controls: We assessed**
the design and implementation of
approval controls such as the portfolio
review committee that cover the
outputs of the models and manual
adjustments to inform the extent of
our substantive testing.

- **Methodology implementation: We**
assessed the methodology and
implementation of the cash flow
forecasting models used in valuing the
portfolio investments, incorporating
our own IT, modelling and valuation
specialists to consider the
appropriateness of the most significant
models, review model code and
challenge certain specific inputs into
the forecasting models;

- **Critical assessment of cash flows:**
Informed by our assessment of the
controls and models noted above, we
assessed the modelled cash flows by
portfolio to identify those portfolios
where more judgement may have been
exercised (for example due to changes
in approach by management to
managing the portfolios) and/or where
we consider greater risk may exist (for
example due to under/overperformance against historic
forecasts). Taking into account these
risk factors and our cumulative audit
experience, we undertook a risk based
selection process to critically assess
the cash flow forecasts and any
manual adjustments made by the
Group with reference to actual historic
collections and our understanding of
the Group; and

- **Assessing transparency: We**
critically assessed the adequacy of the
disclosures regarding the degree of
estimation uncertainty involved in

**Forecast based valuation:**

On 8 April 2019, the Group acquired
Drydens Limited in the UK for £10.2m,
with the assets and liabilities purchased
accounted for at fair value at the date of
acquisition.

The Group prepared the acquisition balance
sheets based on its estimate of the fair
value of assets and liabilities acquired. In
particular, the Group prepared a discounted
cash flow model to arrive at its estimates of
the acquired intangible assets including
customer contracts.

This required the Group to exercise
judgement in determining the expected
cash flows from the assets and the discount
rates to be applied.

F-116


Our procedures included:

- **Accounting analysis: We assessed**
the Group’s accounting policy against
the requirements of the relevant
accounting standard including the
acquisition date and the recognition of
intangible assets;

- **Our sector experience: We**
challenged the completeness of the
acquired net assets and associated
assumptions with reference to our
business understanding of the acquired
entity and testing of the Directors’
assessments. We challenged the
assumptions including value,
probability and timing of cash flows,
made in calculating the fair value
assigned to intangibles with reference
to the business plan, existing customer
contracts and actual performance
achieved;

- **Sensitivity analysis: We performed**
sensitivity analysis on the Group’s key
assumptions being the forecast future
cash flows and discount rate applied to
help us assess their reasonableness
and identify areas of potential
additional focus including any
management bias in their judgement;
and

- **Assessing transparency: We assessed**
the adequacy of the Group’s
disclosures about the degree of
estimation and judgement involved in
arriving at the fair value.

**Our results**

- We found the fair value of the
acquired intangible assets to be
acceptable (2018 result: acceptable).

**Low risk, high value:**

The carrying amount of the parent
company’s investment in subsidiaries and
intra-group debtor balance due from Group
entities represents 100% (2018: 100%) of
the company’s total assets.

Their recoverability does not contain an
inherent high risk of significant
misstatement or subject to significant
judgement. However, due to their
materiality in the context of the parent
company financial statements, this is
considered to be the area that had the
greatest effect on our overall parent
company audit.


Our procedures included:

- **Test of detail: We compared the**
carrying amount of the investments,
representing 100% (2018: 100%) of
the total investment balance, with the
relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance
sheet to identify whether their net
assets, being an approximation of their
minimum recoverable amount, were in
excess of their carrying amount and
assessing whether those subsidiaries
have historically been profit-making;

- We risk assessed 100% of Group
debtors to identify, with reference to
the relevant debtors’ draft balance
sheet, whether they have a positive net
asset value and therefore coverage of
the debt owed, as well as assessing
whether those debtor companies have
historically been profit-making;

- **Assessing subsidiary audits: We**
relied upon the work we performed on
those subsidiaries and considered the
results of that work, on those
subsidiaries profits and net assets; and

- **Our sector experience: For the**
investments where the carrying
amount exceeded the net asset value,
we compared the carrying amount of
the investment with the expected cash
flows of the underlying subsidiaries.

**Our results**

- We found the parent company’s
assessment of the recoverability of the
their investment in subsidiaries and
intra-group debtor balances to be
acceptable (2018 result: acceptable).


**3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit**

Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £3.0m (2018: £3.3m), determined with
reference to a benchmark of profit before tax normalised to provide a more stable measure year on year by
excluding £1.5m acquisition costs and £6.9m in relation to the expansion of the fund management business
(2018: profit before tax normalised to exclude £14.7m of costs in relation to acquisitions and £18.7m in relation
to the Group’s bond finance), of which it represents 5.0% (2018: 4.4%).

Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at £1.9m (2018: £1.6m), determined
with reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 0.4% (2018: 0.4%).

We agreed to report to the audit committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements for the Group
financial statements exceeding £150,000 (2018: £165,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

**How we scoped our audit**

Of the group’s 3 (2018: 10) reporting components, we subjected 3 (2018: 6) to full scope audits for group
purposes.

The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.

The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant
risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.

The Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £1.2m to £2.7m (2018: £1.6m to
£2.6m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.

The work on the overseas components was performed by overseas component auditors. The audit of the UK
component (including the audit of the parent company), was performed by the Group team.

The Group team visited the 3 (2018: 3) key overseas locations, being Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands (2018:
Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands) to assess the audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were
also held with the overseas component auditors throughout the audit. During these visits and meetings, the
findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, key audit working papers were reviewed, and
any further work required by the Group team to be performed by the component auditor was instructed.

**4. We have nothing to report on going concern**

The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate
the Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Company’s and the
Group’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).

Our responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ conclusions and, had there been a
material uncertainty related to going concern, to make reference to that in this audit report. However, as we
cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are
inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a
material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the Group and the Company will continue in
operation.

In our evaluation of the Directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Group’s and Company’s
business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s financial resources or
ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely
affect the Group’s and Company’s available financial resources over this period was significant reduction of cash
collections due to macroeconomic slow down impacting the Group’s ability to comply with financing covenants.

As this was a risk that could potentially cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, we considered sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated
by the Group’s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible (but not unrealistic) adverse effects that
could arise from these risks individually and collectively and evaluated the achievability of the actions the
Directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise.

Based on this work, we are required to report to you if:

- we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement in Note 3 to the
financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least twelve
months from the date of approval of the financial statements; or

- the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 102 of the 2019 Annual Report is materially
inconsistent with our audit knowledge.

We have nothing to report in these respects, and we did not identify going concern as a key audit matter.

**5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report**

The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do
not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial
statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial
statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in
the other information.

_Strategic report and Directors’ report_

Based solely on our work on the other information:

- we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the Directors’ report;

- in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

- in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

_Directors’ remuneration report_

In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

_Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability_

Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing material to add or
draw attention to in relation to:

- the Directors’ confirmation within the statement of viability, on page 39 of the 2019 Annual Report, that
they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;

- the Principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being
managed and mitigated; and

- the Directors’ explanation in the statement of viability of how they have assessed the prospects of the
Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the statement of viability. We have nothing to report in this
respect.

Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial
statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in
outcomes that are inconsistent with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of
anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s longer-term viability.

Corporate governance disclosures

We are required to report to you if:

- we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our financial
statements audit and the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and financial
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or

- the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement does not properly disclose a departure
from the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**7. Respective responsibilities**

_Directors’ responsibilities_

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 103 of the 2019 Annual Report, the directors are
responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditor’s responsibilities_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion
in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

_Irregularities – ability to detect_

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors
and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and
legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures
regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout
our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included
communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at group
level.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial
reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation
legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on
the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the
imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group’s licence to operate. We identified the following areas as
those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, employment law, certain aspects of company legislation
and customer conduct, recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group’s activities and its legal form.
Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and
regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal
correspondence. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance and
considered the effect as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. The identified actual or
suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit to result in our response being identified
as a key audit matter.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our
audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely
the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit,

F-122


-----

**Independent auditor’s report to the members of Arrow Global Group plc**
continued

there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing
non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**1. General information**

Arrow Global Group Plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and is the ultimate parent company of
the Group. The address of the registered office is presented on the inside back cover. The financial statements are
presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the
nearest thousand except when otherwise indicated.

The Company’s subsidiaries, both direct and indirect, at 31 December 2019 are listed in note 23.

The Group’s principal activity is to identify, acquire and manage secured and unsecured defaulted and non-core
loan portfolios and real estate from, and on behalf of financial institutions such as banks, institutional investors
and credit card companies.

The Group’s and the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 have been prepared
in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the EU, and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IFRS
Regulation. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior periods, except for
the new standards discussed in note 2.

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes of the
Company have not been presented in this annual report and accounts.

**2. Accounting standards**

**New standards**

The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year beginning 1 January 2019:

 - IFRS 16 Leases;

 - IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments;

 - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9);

 - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28);

 - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments to IAS 19);

 - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 Cycle – various standards; and

 - IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.

The Group also chose to early adopt the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and
IFRS 7’ in the period.

During 2019, these new standards and interpretations had an insignificant effect on the consolidated financial
statements, apart from IFRS 16 which is discussed in note 2.1.

**2.1 IFRS 16 ‘Leases’**

IFRS 16 replaces the previous standard IAS 17 ‘Leases’, bringing a number of leases on balance sheet, which
were previously off-balance sheet and accounted for as operating leases under IAS 17.

As lessee, under IFRS 16, in respect of leased properties previously accounted for as operating leases the Group
now recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available
for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost.

The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the
shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with leases with a
lease term of twelve months or less and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense in profit or loss
on a straight-line basis.

The Group is not required to restate comparatives on the initial adoption of IFRS 16, and has applied the
modified retrospective approach. The Group has applied exemptions where appropriate for short-term leases of

twelve months or less and low value assets to be expensed and has also applied ‘grandfathering’ to all IAS 17
judgements previously made, including lease terms. The incremental borrowing rates used to measure lease
liabilities at initial application ranged between 4.2% and 7.2%, with a weighted average of 5.8%.

Transition to this new standard has led to a one-off opening 2019 reserves reduction of £0.9 million, a
right-of-use asset disclosed in property, plant and equipment of £23.7 million and a lease liability of
£27.3 million and a release of lease accruals of £2.6 million, both of which are classified in trade and other
payables.

**2.2 Standards issued but not yet adopted**

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements as they do not have a material effect on
the Group’s financial statements.

The following amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements:

 - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards;

 - Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3); and

 - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.

**3. Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation and consolidation**

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and the
Group financial statements also comply with EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair
value of derivative contracts and certain portfolio investments and the amortised cost accounting for other
financial assets and liabilities.

The Group has elected to present the statement of financial position on a liquidity basis. Assets and liabilities
have been presented in order of liquidity as this method of presentation is more relevant to the sector which the
Group operates within.

**Business combinations**

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the
Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets
acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is
recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if they are related to
the issue of debt or equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are recognised in profit or loss.

**Contingent consideration**

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay
contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is
remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Non-controlling interests (NCI)**

NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity
transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 2019 and the comparative period.

‘Subsidiaries’ are entities controlled by the Group. The Group ‘controls’ an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the
elements of control. This includes circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a
lending relationship) become substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on
which control commences until the date on which control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed
of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with
those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on
consolidation. Also see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee benefit trust’ (EBT).

**Securitisation vehicles**

Securitisation vehicles in which the Group holds an economic interest are usually operated according to
predetermined criteria that are part of the initial design of the vehicles. The Group is exposed to variability of
returns from the vehicles through its holding of various securities in the vehicles.

Outside the day-to-day servicing of the receivables (which may be carried out by the Group under a servicing
contract), key decisions are usually required only when the intent of the participants regarding the design of the
economic structure or the strategy for the collection of the underlying assets changes.

In assessing whether it has control, the Group considers whether it manages the key decisions that most
significantly affect these vehicles’ returns, alongside its total variability related to its economic interests in the
vehicles. As a result, the Group has concluded that it controls some of these vehicles, but not all (for more
information on consolidated vehicles, see Note 27).

**Investment funds**

The Group acts as fund manager to a number of investment funds. Determining whether the Group controls such
an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the
Fund (comprising any carried interests and expected management fees) and the investors’ rights to remove the
Fund manager. For all funds managed by the Group, the investors are able to vote by simple majority to remove
the Group as fund manager without cause.

Given the low number of investors who are required to act together to remove the Group as Fund manager
without cause, despite the Group’s aggregate economic interest is some cases being above 30% (depending on
which items are included/excluded), the Group has concluded that it acts as agent for the investors in all cases,
and therefore has not consolidated these funds.

For further disclosure in respect of unconsolidated securitisation vehicles and investment funds in which the
Group has an interest or for which it is a sponsor, see Note 27.

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

_i. Loss of control_

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and
any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any
interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

_ii. Transactions eliminated upon consolidation_

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency
transaction gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment.

**Going concern**

The directors have undertaken a thorough review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios for a period in
excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these accounts. These forecasts have been subject to stress
testing, and downside scenarios have been considered including several hard-Brexit scenarios. This is set out in
more detail in the statement of viability.

In scenarios considered to be reasonable by management, as well as in a severe stress situation, after taking
management actions as required, the Group maintains sufficient cash and banking covenant headroom to
continue as a going concern.

Following this review, and in the light of current cash availability, economic conditions and information
available about future risks and uncertainties, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the
Group financial statements on a going concern basis.

**Foreign Currency**

_i. Foreign currency transactions_

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the
spot exchange rates at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the Group is pounds sterling, which
is also the presentational currency of the Group.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the
spot exchange rate at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference
between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest
and payments during the year and the carrying amount in the foreign currency, translated at the spot exchange
rate at the end of the year.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the
functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary
items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate
at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency differences arising on translation are generally recognised in profit or loss.

_ii. Foreign operations_

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated into sterling at the spot exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses
of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the monthly average exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve
(translation reserve).

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

When a foreign operation is disposed of in such a way that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the
translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on
disposal. If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation whilst
still retaining control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI.

**Interest**

_i. Effective interest rate_

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective
interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected
life of the financial instrument to:

 - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or

 - the amortised cost of the financial liability.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated creditimpaired assets, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial
instrument, but not ECL.

For purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated
using estimated future cash flows including ECL. This is the case for all the Group’s portfolio investments held
at amortised cost, recognised since the introduction of IFRS 9.

Additionally, for such assets, the future cash flows are forecast across the next 84 months following the balance
sheet date. This is the point by which substantially all of the cash flows will have been received from a normal
portfolio investment, and the point at which the Group is comfortable in forecasting to.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability, such as legal and due diligence fees.

_ii. Amortised cost and gross carrying amount_

The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or
financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative
amortisation, using the effective interest method, of any difference between that initial amount and the expected
cash flows and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any
expected credit loss allowance. However, for amortised cost portfolio assets the concept of a separable expected
credit loss allowance is not applied, because due to the nature of the portfolio assets, expected cash flows are
forecast including an estimate of expected credit losses, including multiple economic scenarios.

_iii. Calculation of interest income and expense_

The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition. In
calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the
asset (when the asset is not credit impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is
revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating-rate instruments to reflect movements in
market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date on
which amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins. For financial assets that have become credit-impaired
subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the
amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest
income reverts to the gross basis.

F-133

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, which includes all of the Group’s portfolio
investments held at amortised cost, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest
rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if
the credit risk of the asset improves.

Interest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL are presented in fair
value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL.

**Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL**

Fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL represents all of the income and expenses relating to the
Group’s portfolio investments which are classified as FVTPL. The line item includes fair value changes, interest
and dividends.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established. Usually, this is the ex-dividend
date for quoted equity securities. Dividends are presented in fair value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL
or other income based on the underlying classification of the equity investment.

**Leases**

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative
information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The details of
accounting policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are disclosed separately.

_i. Group acting as a leasee_

Policy applicable from 1 January 2019

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

This policy is applied to contracts entered into (or changed) on, or after 1 January 2019.

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone price. However, for
leases of premises the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for the lease and
non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of
costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to
the end of the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is
periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as
the discount rate.

F-134


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by analysing its borrowings from various external sources
and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of asset leased.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

 - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

 - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date;

 - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and

 - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in
an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties
for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there
is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s
estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its
assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised
in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of
the right-of-use asset. The adjustment is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset
has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘trade and other
payables’ in the statement of financial position.

_ii. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and
short-term leases, including leases of IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with
these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_iii. Policy applicable before 1 January 2019_

For contracts entered into before 1 January 2019, the Group determined whether the arrangement was or
contained a lease based on the assessment of whether:

 - fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and

 - the arrangement had conveyed a right to use the asset.

The Group did not have any finance leases under IAS 17.

Assets held under other leases were classified as operating leases and were not recognised in the Group’s
statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases were recognised in profit or loss on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received were recognised as an integral part of the
total lease expense, over the term of the lease.

_iv. Group acting as a lessor_

None of the arrangements which the Group has entered into have been determined to constitute the Group acting
as a lessor under the definitions of IFRS 16.

**Taxation**

_i. Income tax_

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that
it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments,
do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore has accounted for them under IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and has recognised the related expenses in ‘other expenses’.

_ii. Current tax_

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year and any
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or
receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related
to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

_iii. Deferred tax asset_

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognised for:

 - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

 - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the Group is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the
foreseeable future; and

 - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future
taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of
taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits,
adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on business plans for individual
subsidiaries in the Group.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable
profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to
income taxes, if there is any.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the
Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this
purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through
sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities**

_i. Recognition and initial measurement_

The Group initially recognises portfolio investments, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities on the
date on which they are acquired. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of
financial assets) are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL,
transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. The fair value of a financial instrument at
initial recognition is generally its transaction price.

_ii. Classification_

Financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated
as at FVTPL:

 - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;
and

 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest (SPPI).

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated
as at FVTPL:

 - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets; and

 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. No
such elections have been made by the Group.

All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the
requirements to be measured at amortised cost or as at FVOCI as FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly
reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. No such designations have been made by the Group.

**Business model assessment**

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level
because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The
information considered includes:

 - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In
particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a
particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities
that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;

 - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;

 - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business
model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;

F-137


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

 - how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the
assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and

 - the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations
about future sales activity.

However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of
how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

The Group’s portfolio investments are comprised of various types of underlying credit positions. These
investments are held by the Group for the primary purpose of collecting the underlying cash flows to the fullest
extent possible. Sales of such portfolio investments are not a common occurrence and are not part of
management’s strategy for such investments when they are purchased.

_Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest_

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated
with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and
costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the
instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the
timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment,
the Group considers:

 - contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;

 - leverage features;

 - prepayment and extension terms;

 - terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and

 - features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

Equity and similar instruments have contractual cash flows that do not meet the SPPI criterion. Accordingly, all
such financial assets are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI option is selected.

**Contractually linked instruments**

The Group has some investments in securitisations that are considered contractually linked instruments.
Contractually linked instruments each have a specified subordination ranking that determines the order in which
any cash flows generated by the pool of underlying investments are allocated to the instruments. Such an
instrument meets the SPPI criterion only if all of the following conditions are met:

 - the contractual terms of the instrument itself give rise to cash flows that are SPPI without looking through to
the underlying pool of financial instruments;

 - the underlying pool of financial instruments (i) contains one or more instruments that give rise to cash flows
that are SPPI; and (ii) may also contain instruments, such as derivatives, that reduce the cash flow
variability of the instruments under (i) and the combined cash flows (of the instruments under (i) and (ii))
give rise to cash flows that are SPPI; or align the cash flows of the contractually linked instruments with the
cash flows of the pool of underlying instruments under (i) arising as a result of differences in whether
interest rates are fixed or floating or the currency or timing of cash flows; and

 - the exposure to credit risk inherent in the contractually linked instruments is equal to or less than the
exposure to credit risk of the underlying pool of financial instruments.

F-138

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Reclassifications**

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group
changes its business model for managing financial assets.

**Financial assets**

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor
retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying
amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received
(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had
been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is
not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets
that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

In transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognise the asset to
the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value
of the transferred asset.

In certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The
transferred asset is derecognised if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognised for the
servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for
performing the servicing.

**Financial liabilities**

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.

_i. Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities_

If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified
asset are substantially different.

If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial
asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and a new financial
asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification
are accounted for as follows:

 - fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement
of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and

 - other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of
the financial asset, then the Group first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the
original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss
in profit or loss. Any costs or fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of
the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset. The gain
or loss is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified
liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is

F-139


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and
the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred,
if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as a derecognition, then the amortised cost of the
liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment
to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability
by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

_ii. Offsetting_

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends
either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS Standards, or for gains and
losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.

_iii. Fair value measurement_

‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most
advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its
non-performance risk.

When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active
market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place
with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of
relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique
incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction
price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Group determines that the fair value on
initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an
active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable
inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the difference, then the financial instrument is initially
measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the
transaction price.

Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument
but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed
out.

The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount
payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period
during which the change has occurred.

_iv. Impairment_

The Group recognises loss allowances for ECL on financial assets that are debt instruments, and that are not
measured at FVTPL. No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments. The Group has not taken the low
credit risk exemption for any of its financial assets.

F-140


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for financial instruments (other
than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition
(excluding credit-impaired assets), for which they are measured as 12-month ECL.

12-month ECL are the portion of lifetime ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are
possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which 12-month ECL are
recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’. Financial instruments allocated to Stage 1 have not
undergone a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and are not credit-impaired.

Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial
instrument or the maximum contractual period of exposure. Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are
recognised but that are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’. Financial
instruments allocated to Stage 2 are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition but are not credit-impaired.

Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognised and that are credit-impaired are referred to as
‘Stage 3 financial instruments’.

**Measurement of ECL**

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

 - financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls
(i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash
flows that the Group expects to receive);

 - financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date, except POCI financial assets: as the difference
between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; or

 - POCI financial assets: the ECL is incorporated into the estimated future cash flows, therefore it is not
possible to separate this from a ‘gross carrying amount’ of these assets. As such, although ECL is
incorporated into the carrying amount, a separate loss allowance is not held for POCI financial assets. The
only material assets in this category are the portfolio investments held at amortised cost.

When discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:

 - financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets and lease
receivables: the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof;

 - POCI assets: a credit-adjusted effective interest rate; or

 - lease receivables: the discount rate used in measuring the lease receivable.

**Restructured financial assets**

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified, then an assessment is made of whether the financial
asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:

 - If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash
flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the
existing asset; or

 - If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of
the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its
derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset
that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective
interest rate of the existing financial asset.

F-141


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Credit-impaired financial assets**

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired
(referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that
have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a
financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

 - significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;

 - a breach of contract such as a default or past-due event;

 - the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;

 - it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

 - the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

**POCI financial assets**

POCI financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. For POCI assets, lifetime ECL are
incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate on initial recognition. Consequently, POCI assets do
not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognised as a loss allowance subsequent
to initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition of the asset.

**Designation at fair value through profit or loss**

The Group has not designated any financial assets or liabilities as FVTPL in either the current or previous
periods.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

‘Cash and cash equivalents’ include notes and coins on hand and highly liquid financial assets with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost in the statement of financial position.

**Derivatives held for risk management purposes and hedge accounting**

All derivatives are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. The Group designates certain
derivatives held for risk management as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.

On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objective and strategy in undertaking the
hedge, together with the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.

The Group makes an assessment, both on inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the hedging instrument(s) is (are) expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair
value or cash flows of the respective hedged item(s) during the period for which the hedge is designated, and
whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80–125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast
transaction, the Group makes an assessment of whether the forecast transaction is highly probable to occur and
presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit or loss.

**Other assets**

No ECL has been recognised for intercompany loans, cash and cash equivalents or trade and other receivables,
on the basis that the ECL on such items is deemed to be immaterial.

F-142

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

**Cash flow hedges**

When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable
to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or highly probable forecast transaction that
could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI
and presented in the hedging reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in the hedging reserve is
reclassified from OCI to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period as the hedged cash
flows affect profit or loss, and in the same line item in the statement of profit or loss and OCI.

If the hedging derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for cash flow
hedge accounting, or the hedge designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. However, if
the derivative is novated to a CCP by both parties as a consequence of laws or regulations without changes in its terms
except for those that are necessary for the novation, then the derivative is not considered expired or terminated. If the
hedged cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the Group immediately reclassifies the amount in the hedging
reserve from OCI to profit or loss. For terminated hedging relationships, if the hedged cash flows are still expected to
occur, then the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is not reclassified until the hedged cash flows affect profit or
loss; if the hedged cash flows are expected to affect profit or loss in multiple reporting periods, then the Group reclassifies
the amount in the hedging reserve from OCI to profit or loss on a straight-line basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

_i. Recognition and measurement_

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised within other income in
profit or loss.

_ii. Subsequent expenditure_

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the
expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

_iii. Depreciation_

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated
residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in
profit or loss. Land is not depreciated.

The estimated useful lives of property and equipment for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

Furniture five years
Computer equipment three years
Leasehold improvements five years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

**Intangible assets and goodwill**

_i. Software licences and IT platforms_

Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

F-143

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Expenditure on internally developed software, such as IT platforms, is recognised as an asset when the Group is
able to demonstrate that the product is technically and commercially feasible, its intention and ability to complete
the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and that it can
reliably measure the costs to complete the development.

The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the
software plus capitalised borrowing costs and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is
stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as it is
incurred.

Software, including IT platforms, is amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over its estimated useful
life, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software for the current and
comparative periods is three to ten years. Amortisation is disclosed within other expenses within the statement of
profit and loss.

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

_ii. Customer intangibles_

When the Group acquires businesses which have material ongoing customer relationships, whether they are
contractual or not, the principles of IFRS 3 dictate that the fair value of such customer relationships must be
estimated and recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition date. The impact of this is to effectively reduce
the goodwill recognised on acquisition.

Subsequent to the initial recognition of such assets, they are amortised over the expected life of the customer
relationships with the Group. This amortisation is recognised within operating expenses.

The useful lives and carrying values of customer intangibles are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
appropriate.

_iii. Goodwill_

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment
properties and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows
from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising
from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use is based on the estimated future post-tax cash flows, discounted to their present value using a
post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset or CGU.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.

The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one CGU.
Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of
the testing of the CGUs to which the corporate assets are allocated.

F-144


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro
rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**Borrowings**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of any transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are stated subsequently at amortised cost; any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs
and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over
the expected life of the borrowings using the EIR. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the
Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of
financial position date.

The Group classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the
substance of the contractual terms of the instruments.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation with an outflow of economic
resources. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the consideration required to settle that
obligation at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position and are discounted to present value.

**Employee benefits**

_i. Share-based payment transactions_

Share-based payment transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own
equity instruments are accounted for as equity settled share-based payments.

The grant date fair value of the share-based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense,
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to
the awards.

The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect
the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be
met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the
related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

For share-based payments with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is
measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual
outcomes. Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, the costs
are recharged to the subsidiary in line with the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’.

_ii. Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)_

Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore,
reflected in these financial statements.

_iii. Retirement benefit costs_

Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as the employees provide services to the
Group.

F-145

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**3. Significant accounting policies continued**

The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, made contributions to defined contribution
plans to provide pension benefits for employees upon retirement, and otherwise, has no residual obligation or
commitments in respect of any defined benefit scheme.

**Inventories**

As part of the Group’s investment activities, it sometimes acquires real estate positions as part of a transaction.
Where such real estate is acquired for the purposes of immediate resale, or where a sale will immediately follow
a period of time where capital expenditure is being applied to the asset, such investments fall under the scope of
IAS 2 – Inventories.

In line with IAS 2, all assets classified as inventories are held at initial cost, plus any subsequent cost of capital
expenditure. Such assets are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, but apart from this, no gain or loss
will be taken on the value of the assets until the point at which they are sold, or partially sold.

**Associates**

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and
operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the
voting power of another entity, or can demonstrate significant influence, or evidence through a number of aspects
such as representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making and decisions, material
transactions between the entity and investee, interchange of managerial personnel or provision of essential
technical information. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity
movements of the associate from the date that significant influence commences until the date that it ceases.

**Share capital and reserves**

_i. Share capital_

Incremental costs that are directly attributable to the issue of an equity instrument are deducted from the initial
measurement of the equity instruments.

_ii. Other reserves_

Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are
further explained in note 19.

**Intercompany receivables**

The Company holds material intercompany receivables within its statement of financial position. These have
been assessed under the IFRS 9 ECL criteria, measuring expected losses over the longest contractual period the
Company is exposed to credit risks. The Company has concluded that these assets have no material ECL.

**Operating expenses**

Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated with collection activities. All operating costs are
accounted for on an accruals basis.

**Earnings per share**

The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the
profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss that is
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.

**Segment reporting**

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with any of the Group’s
other components, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker
(CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for
which discrete financial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the Group’s Board (being
the CODM) include items that are directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a
reasonable basis.

**Deferred and contingent consideration**

During the normal course of business, the Group enters in agreements with third-parties to purchase portfolios of
financial assets, and the consideration paid may include an element of deferred consideration. Such consideration
is discounted at the Group’s weighted average cost of debt to its present value at the point of initial recognition of
the acquired portfolio asset, and this discounted amount is included within the purchase price of the portfolio
asset. A liability for the discounted amount of deferred consideration is also recognised at this time.
Subsequent to this, the discount taken from the gross deferred consideration payable to the initial present value is
recognised in the income statement as a finance cost over time.

Usually as part of business acquisitions, the Group also enters into arrangements with third-parties to pay
amounts in the future which are contingent on the outcome of a future event, such as the acquired business
meeting certain operational or financial targets. In such instances, the Group forms an initial estimation of the
fair value of such consideration by assessing the likelihood of paying out a range of amounts, and using this
analysis to calculate the probability-weighted average expected pay out. This amount is then discounted at the
Group’s cost of debt to bring it to its present value at the point of acquisition. An assessment is made at this point
as to whether the payments constitute a post-employment benefit arrangement with former owners, or not. If this
is not the case, the present value is included within the consideration paid to acquire the business and within
goodwill, if relevant. Each period the discount is unwound to the income statement as a finance cost, and the
liability is remeasured to its current fair value at that point in time.

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates**

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

**Judgements**

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is set out below.

_i. Classification of amortised cost financial assets_

The Group holds the majority of its portfolio investments at amortised cost, due to the fact that management have
determined that these assets that meet the SPPI criteria, and are held in a ‘hold to collect’ business model. The
SPPI criteria for each portfolio are assessed at the point each portfolio is being approved for purchase, and are
based on the nature of the underlying loans which are being purchased. This determination is made for each
purchase individually, unless it is a follow-on purchase of the same or very similar assets, which have already
been assessed.

Regarding the ‘hold to collect’ business model, the Group has determined that this is the most appropriate IFRS 9
business model classification for its general portfolio holding activities, as although in the past a small number of
portfolios have been sold outright to a third-party, such sales do not comprise a material component of the
Group’s ERC at any point in time. Therefore, such infrequent sales activity is not deemed to invalidate the ‘hold
to collect’ business model which the Group employs for the vast majority of its portfolio assets.

F-147


-----

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued**

Another judgement which has been made regarding the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets is that they all
fall within the POCI classification for IFRS 9 impairment measurement purposes. This judgement has been made
by the Group, based upon the fact that historic purchase history and the current composition of the amortised cost
portfolio investments shows that such assets tend to be bought at a point in time where they are credit impaired in
some manner. This is supported by not only the nature of the assets, but by the fact that they are usually
purchased at a deep discount, which is reflective of their incurred credit losses to date.

_ii. Determination of control over investees_

Arrow holds an economic interest in a number of entities which it has been deemed to not control. As such, these
entities are not consolidated into the Group’s financial statements, but rather, the investment in such entities is
recognised as a single asset within the appropriate balance sheet classification, usually within portfolio
investments. Conversely the Group also consolidates entities into its financial statements which it does not have
100% ownership of, but the Group has been judged to control such entities regardless.

The judgement as to whether or not the Group has control over an entity is taken on a case-by-case basis by
management, and is firstly based upon whether the Group can exercise any power over the relevant activities of
the entity, and if this is the case, whether there is deemed to be a link between such power and the variability of
the Group’s returns which arise from the entity.

In many cases the determination of control is clear. Cases where management must apply more judgement can
occur where the Group holds a minority equity-level financial interest in a structured entity, as well as providing
various services to these entities in a typical supplier-customer relationship capacity. In these cases, the Group
mainly assesses the relative share of marginal variable returns which flow to third-parties versus the share which
flows to the Group as a primary indicator of whether the Group is exercising any power it may have to influence
the variable returns of the structured entity primarily for its own benefit, or for the benefit of third-parties in the
structure. In the case of the former fact pattern, the entity will usually be consolidated, whereas under the latter,
the entity will usually not be consolidated.

**Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

_i. Fair value of net assets acquired as part of business combinations_

The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies.
Goodwill is the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Therefore the fair
value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. The determination of
the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management judgement, particularly for those
financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired portfolio investments
and customer intangibles where valuations reflect estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows. Different
valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to the post-acquisition performance of the acquired
entities. Further detail on the valuation of acquired loan portfolios is given in section ii. below. Note 30 provides
further detail on acquisitions in the period and the net assets acquired on each.

_ii. Carrying value of portfolio investments_

The carrying value of portfolio investments is £1,163,624,000 at 31 December 2019 (2018: £1,087,030,000). The
majority of these portfolio investments are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of the portfolio
investments are based on cash flow forecasts that are prepared for each portfolio. Typically, these forecasts cover
an 84-month period, except in the case of a number of FVTPL portfolios where it is necessary to forecast cash
flows over a 120-month period to capture all of the material cash flows. The 84-month period is deemed to be the
most appropriate time frame over which expected cash flows are measured, as this is the point that modelling
accuracy begins to fall below a supportable threshold.

The cash flow (ERC) forecasts are generated using a mixture of asset-specific forecasts and statistical models,
incorporating a number of factors, including predictions of probability to pay, which is informed by customer and
account level data, credit agency data and our historical experience with accounts which have similar key

F-148

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued**

attributes. A further key model input is previous payments made by a customer. Additionally, estimates are made
of the movement of accounts from non-paying to paying, and vice-versa, either through breakdown of the
account or settlement/pay down of the balances due. In relation to non-paying accounts, assumptions will be
made as to which operational strategy is the most appropriate to move the account to paying status, which may
include placing these accounts into litigation. Operational factors that may impact future estimated ERCs are also
considered, such as improved collections processes and systems.

Management also review the model on a portfolio basis to take into account external factors, which have
impacted historical, or will impact future performance and where necessary portfolios are calibrated to take into
account these known factors. Known or estimated factors such as HPI increases/decreases, or planned litigation
action are examples of key assumptions which are made that impact management’s forecast of ERCs. The
assumptions and estimates made are specific to the particular characteristics of each portfolio.

The ERCs created from the ERC forecasting models are regularly bench-marked at a portfolio level against
actual performance, and this helps to inform the decision as to whether an impairment gain/loss may be required.
Furthermore, with the introduction of IFRS 9 in 2018, ERCs also include specific consideration of multiple
economic scenarios and the impact these are likely to have on collections in the future. For further information
on this please see note 25.

The estimated future cash flows generated by the above process are the key estimate/judgement in these financial
statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by +1/-1% would impact the closing carrying value of
the amortised cost and FVTPL portfolio investments as at 31 December 2019 by +/- £11,020,000 (2018: +/£10,870,000). The forecasting period over which ERCs are calculated is also a key estimate/ judgement in these
financial statements. Adding or removing six months to the cash flow forecasting period would increase/(reduce)
the closing carrying value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2019 by £12,453,000/(£17,326,000)
(2018: £13,796,000/(£16,360,000)). Note that there are a large number of inputs which are used to derive the
ERC and hence the carrying value of portfolios. However, many of these are factual historical data points which
do not individually involve significant estimation uncertainty, and as such, an overall combined sensitivity has
been provided.

_iii. Impairment assessment of goodwill balances_

The carrying amount of goodwill is £267,700,000 at 31 December 2019. In line with the Group’s accounting
policies, the goodwill balance is assessed for impairment at each annual reporting date. The impairment
assessment is carried out on a value in use basis, using discounted cash flow models for each cash generating unit
(CGU) to determine whether the ongoing value in use of each CGU is higher than its carrying amount. No
impairment was recognised as a result of the assessment performed as at 31 December 2019. This assessment is
sensitive to the discount rate applied, and management’s forecast future cash flows for each CGU. Further
information about the methodology applied and sensitivities to these factors are disclosed in note 13.

**5. Segmental reporting**

The Group reports under three separate reportable segments. Segmental information has been provided in line
with what is reviewed on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is the board of
directors collectively, as defined in IFRS 8. The principal business categories are as follows:

Investment Business (IB) All portfolio investments that the Group owns, and the income and costs associated
with them


Asset Management and
Servicing Business
(AMS)


Income and costs associated with managing debt portfolios on behalf of the Group
and external servicers. Our Fund Management business is reported under this
segment.


Group functions Costs not directly associated with either the Investment or Asset Management and
Servicing Business, but relevant to overall oversight and control of the Group’s
activities

F-149

**Notes to the Financial Statements**
Continued

**5. Segmental reporting continued**

These segments represent how the Group manages the wider business, and the organisational structure is aligned
to these segments. Therefore, this has been deemed to be the appropriate level of disaggregation to provide
information to the CODM. Further granularity, such as type of AMS contract, or type of IB portfolio, is not how
the business is managed or organised, and hence such further detail has not been presented to the CODM, or in
the segmental disclosures.

The intra-segment elimination column below removes charges made from the AMS business segment to the IB
segment on behalf of the Group for servicing and collection of the Group’s portfolio investments. The intrasegment charge is calculated on equivalent commercial terms to charging third parties. For further information on
adjusting items, please see the additional information section.

Income from contracts with customers has been disaggregated on a geographical basis, as a similar set of services
are provided to customers across the geographies, and therefore this was deemed to be the most appropriate level
of disaggregation for this disclosure.

Non-current assets are assets with a useful life of more than one year with the exception of deferred tax which
has been excluded.

Gross AMS income includes commission income, debt collection, due diligence, real estate management,
advisory fees and intra-Group income for these services.

**6. Income from asset management and servicing**

Income from Asset Management and Servicing (AMS) contracts with customers is measured based on the
consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Group recognises revenue when it satisfies a
performance obligation related to a service it has undertaken to provide to a customer.

**Asset management and servicing income**

Servicing income makes up the majority of AMS income, and in itself comprises a broad range of services,
including secured and unsecured collection activity, real estate asset realisation, legal title holding, due diligence
activities, initial platform migration and on-boarding activities, securitisation vehicle set-up and ongoing
management activities, new origination activities, litigation and court process management and third-party
sub-servicer management.

In all material cases, the services are provided at a point in time which corresponds to the satisfaction of the
related performance obligations. As such, revenue arising from servicing income is normally recognised as the
services are provided to the customer, with no deferral or acceleration of revenue across the life of the contract.

**Fund management income**

Fund management income encompasses services provided in relation to the discretionary and semi-discretionary
allocation and management of third-party capital. Fees for fund management services are normally calculated
based on a fixed percentage of the value of assets managed and deducted from the customer’s account balance on
a regular basis. Revenue from fund management services is recognised over time as the services are provided.

**Contract balances**

At 31 December 2019, the Group had assets relating to contracts with customers in the amount of £3.1m
(31 December 2018: £nil). These assets relate to up-front costs which were incurred to acquire customers, and
will be released to the income statement across the same period as the associated revenue will be recognised. The
weighted average life remaining on these contract balances is 8 years (31 December 2018: n/a). None of the
contract balances have impacted the Group’s income to date.

The rate of UK corporation tax, as enacted under previous Finance Acts, was expected to reduce to 17% from
1 April 2020. Although the UK Government has announced its intention to pass revised legislation under which
the rate would remain at 19%, no legislation has been introduced at the balance sheet date and therefore deferred
tax balances in relation to the UK have been calculated using a rate of 17%.

In December 2019, a new corporate tax law was enacted in the Netherlands. Consequently, as of 1 January 2020,
the corporate tax rate in the Netherlands will be reduced from 25% to 21.7%. This change resulted in a gain of
€1,147,000 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group’s Dutch subsidiaries
being recognised during the year ended 31 December 2019.

**Deferred tax**

The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £2,560,000 (2018: £859,000) of tax losses carried
forward, due to uncertainties over the future utilisation of the losses, including the future profitability of the
relevant subsidiaries. These losses may be available for offset against future profits and have no expiry date.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities.

_Tax impact of the UK giving notice to withdraw from the EU_

Given that the UK has now exited the EU (at 31 January 2020), the Group has considered the impact of Brexit
from a tax perspective. The UK is in a transition period until 31 December 2020, during which time all EU
directives will continue to be in force. As such, no impact to the Group’s tax position is expected in 2020.

It is too soon to know what the arrangements may be with the EU from 1 January 2021 onwards, however the
Group does not expect there to be any significant impact from a tax perspective.

_Uncertainty over income tax treatments_

The current tax liability of £7,645,000 represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and
prior year periods, including a provision in relation to uncertain tax positions.

As for most multinationals, the current tax environment is creating increasing levels of uncertainty and the Group
is potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions. By their nature, these are often complex and could take a
significant period of time to be agreed with the tax authorities. The Group estimates and accrues taxes that will
ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of tax returns are completed. The levels of risk
arising from tax audits may change as a result of legislative change, tax authority guidance or practice and
correspondence with the tax authorities during a specific audit. It is not possible to quantify the impact that such
future developments may have on the tax positions taken in the financial statements.

1. See note 30 for a detailed analysis of additions to goodwill during the year.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit
from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to four aggregated CGUs on
the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes
and are not larger than the single operating segment defined under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments).

**Goodwill CGU allocation**

In relation to goodwill, the four CGUs identified are UK and Ireland, comprising all Group companies acquired
in the Capquest acquisition, Arrow Global Receivables Management Limited, Mars Capital, Bergen and
Drydens; Portugal, comprising of all the Group companies acquired in the Whitestar, Gesphone, Redrock and
Norfin acquisitions; Benelux, comprising all the Group companies acquired in the Vesting acquisition; and Italy,
comprising Zenith, Parr Credit and Europa Investimenti S.p.A. The UK and Ireland, Portugal, Benelux, and Italy
CGUs, represent the cash flows generated principally from collections on acquired portfolio investments and
management and servicing of third-party debt.

Given the structure and operating model of the Group, it has been deemed appropriate to combine a number of
CGUs for impairment testing purposes. This is in line with the Group’s stated strategy of providing a range of
services in each geographic region in which the Group operates and represents the lowest level at which the
Group’s resources and assets are allocated internally.

The discount rate was a post-tax rate based on the yield of average European 10-year government bonds, adjusted
for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities generally and the systemic risk of the
specific CGU.

Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term growth rate into
perpetuity has been determined as the lower of the nominal GDP rates for the countries in which the CGU
operates and the long-term compound annual profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation growth rate
estimated by management.

Budgeted profit before taxes, depreciation and amortisation were based on expectations of future outcomes
taking into account past experience, adjusted for the anticipated revenue growth. Revenue growth was projected
taking into account the average growth levels experienced over the past five years and the estimated growth for
the next five years.

**13. Goodwill continued**

The key assumptions described above may change as economic and market conditions change. The Group
estimates that likely possible changes in these assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of any CGU
to decline below the carrying amount.

The Group’s goodwill balance has been assessed and no part of the overall balance is deemed to be deductible for
tax purposes.

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:

An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2019 that resulted in no impairment to goodwill. The
goodwill was assessed to be appropriately stated. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGUs is
determined as the higher of fair value, less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations were as follows:

2019 2018

UK and Ireland Portugal Benelux Italy UK and Ireland Portugal Benelux Italy

Discount rate % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **8.6%** **9.0%** **8.2%** **9.0%** 8.5% 8.9% 8.2% 8.9%

forecasts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.0%** **2.2%** **2.0%** **1.7%** 2.0% 2.2% 2.0% 1.7%

**Discount rates**

Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Post-tax rates are used alongside post-tax cash flows, as the
post-tax discount rate is more readily derived from observable market information. Any potential differences
between post-tax discount rates and cash flows and the pre-tax method under IAS 36 – Impairment of assets have
been considered, and no material differences between approaches have been identified.

The starting point for determining the discount rates for each CGU was to use the Group’s weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) and adjust this for specific factors for each of the CGUs to derive a market participant’s rate.
The factors took into account the risks inherent in each of the CGUs; such as currency, regulatory, and economic
risks and the different operations in the CGUs were also considered.

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management
for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity. The forecasts assume growth rates in
collection activity which in turn drive forecast collections and cost figures. These assumptions are in keeping
with the directors’ expectations of future growth. Appropriate tax rates are applied to the cash flow forecasts for
each CGU. The analysis has been prepared using post-tax cash flows and discount rates, as post-tax discount
rates can be more readily derived from observable market data. The Group is satisfied that this is materially equal
to performing the analysis on pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value. The CGUs
would become impaired based on a net post-tax cash flow reduction set out below, or based on an increase in the
discount rate noted below:

Other receivables includes contract balances of £3.1 million and £3.4 million of receivables related to contracts
with customers. Bank balances not classified as cash and cash equivalents are those cash balances which, while
controlled by the Group, are not readily available for immediate use by the Group. This is usually because the
cash payments are subject to constraints regarding when the balance can be remitted, such as in a securitisation
structure awaiting a payment date.

Included within other liabilities is €2,463,000 (£2,095,000) (31 December 2018: €1,970,000 (£1,771,000))
relating to deferred pay for the Italian employees. The employees are part of statutory indemnity schemes,
compulsory by law, that entitles them to deferred pay, typically at the end of their employment, the ‘Trattamento
di fine rapport’ (TFR). A liability is recognised to reflect that the indemnity will be paid at a future date, when
the employees leave employment. The liability is included within trade and other payables on the statement of
financial position and is calculated by an independent expert through an actuarial valuation, the key assumptions
used are detailed below:

**18. Contingent liabilities**

Through the ordinary course of business, the Group exposes itself to potential liabilities which at present it is not
aware of, and may or may not arise in the future. As such, it would not be practical to try and quantify their
future financial impact. However, set out below are broad areas of the Group’s ordinary business activities which
may in the future lead to potential claims or liabilities being incurred by the Group.

**Conduct and regulatory compliance**

Given the high level of scrutiny regarding financial institutions’ treatment of customers and business conduct
from regulatory bodies, the media and politicians, there is a possibility that certain aspects of the current or
historic business, including, amongst other things, collections practices and general treatment of customers, may
be determined by the FCA and other regulatory bodies or the courts as, in their opinion, not being conducted in
accordance with applicable laws or regulations, or fair and reasonable treatment.

**Contractual disputes**

In carrying out its ongoing business, the Group enters into numerous contracts in any given year with a various
third-party entities. There is always a risk that a contractual dispute may arise in the future, which may lead to a
claim against the Group in respect of any damages or losses incurred by the third-party.

**Own shares**

Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The Company has an
employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.

Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds
and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the financial statements on
transactions in treasury shares.

**Nature and purpose of reserves**

**Hedging reserve**

The hedging reserve comprises the net cumulative fair value adjustments on the derivative contracts used in the
Group’s hedging activities which are deemed to be effective.

**Own share reserve**

The own share reserve comprises the cost of the Company’s ordinary shares held by the Group. At 31 December
2019, the Company held 628,874 ordinary shares of 1p each (2018: 1,030,766 ordinary shares of 1p each) held in
an employee benefit trust. This represents 0.4% of the Company’s share capital as at 31 December 2019.

**Translation reserve**

The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial
statements of foreign operations.

**Merger reserve**

The merger reserve represents the reserve generated upon consolidation of the Group following the Group
reconstruction as part of the IPO where Arrow Global became the parent company.

**20. Dividends**

The following dividends were recognised as distributions to owners during the year ended 31 December 2019:


**2019**
**£000**


2018
£000


Interim dividend 2019: 4.4p per ordinary share (2018: 4.0p) . . . . . . . . . . **7,751** 7,002

**23,062** 21,158

The 2019 interim dividend was declared at 50% of the 2018 final dividend. A final dividend for 2019 has been
proposed of 8.7p, bringing the total dividend for the year to 13.1p being 40% of underlying profit after tax. The
proposed final dividend is subject to approval at the annual general meeting and has, therefore, not been included
as a liability in these financial statements.

**20. Dividends continued**

The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 11 June 2020, with a record date of 12 June 2020 and a payment
date of 17 July 2020. Shareholders will have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase
existing shares in the Company through a dividend reinvestment plan with an election date of 26 June 2020. The
dividend has not been recognised as a liability and there are no tax consequences.

**21. Leases**

The Group has leases for offices and production vehicles. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of
low-value underlying assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability. The Group classifies its right-of-use assets in a consistent manner to its property, plant and equipment
(see note 15).

Leases of vehicles are usually limited to a lease term of two to four years. Leases of property generally have a
lease term ranging from five years to ten years. Lease payments are generally fixed, however there are a limited
number of property leases where rentals are linked to annual changes in an index (either RPI or CPI).

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset
to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Leases are either non-cancellable or may
only be cancelled by incurring a substantive termination fee. Some leases contain an option to purchase the
underlying leased asset outright at the end of the lease, or to extend the lease for a further term. The Group is
prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets as security. For leases over office buildings the
Group must keep those properties in a good state of repair and return the properties in their original condition at
the end of the lease. Further, the Group must insure items of property, plant and equipment and incur
maintenance fees on such items in accordance with the lease contracts.

**Right-of-use assets**

Right-of-use assets relate to leased office premises and vehicles that are presented within property, plant and
equipment (see note 15).

**21. Leases continued**

The primary difference between the total future minimum lease payment as at 31 December 2018 and the
opening right of use assets recognised on adoption to IFRS 16 relates to the phasing of the IAS 17 charge,
including recognition of rent-free periods over the lease term, as opposed to the straight line depreciation of an
opening right of use balance, which was determined by discounting the future lease payments at the incremental
cost of borrowing relating to a particular lease. This resulted in a timing difference on the recognition of the lease
expense between IAS 17 and IFRS 16.

**Amounts recognised in profit or loss**

(1,367) (686) 222,331 40 220,318

The material receivable balance due from subsidiary undertakings from Arrow Global One Limited relates
primarily to final dividends declared by Arrow Global One Limited in 2018. In the current period, the movement
in this balance relate primarily to the partial settlement in cash of this receivable. Balances relate to intercompany
loans that are repayable on demand and are therefore held as current liabilities or assets. No ‘other’ transactions
occurred between the related parties, excluding those disclosed above.

As a loan repayable on demand, expected credit losses were estimated on the assumption that repayment of the
loan is demanded at the reporting date. It was assessed that loan was not in default as (i) the repayment had not
been demanded, and (ii) the subsidiary was considered to be performing.

The maximum period over which expected impairment losses were measured was the period needed to transfer
the cash once demanded. As at 31 December 2019, Arrow Global One Limited could repay the outstanding
balance of the receivable within six months, with the majority of the payment being received immediately.
Therefore, the expected credit loss was limited to the effect of discounting the amount due on the balance over
this period. As the expected repayment schedule is short, discounting at the receivable’s effective interest rate did
not result in a material expected credit loss.

During the year there were no other related party transactions other than discussed above.

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**23. Investments in subsidiaries and associate continued**

All subsidiaries are included in the Group consolidation, including where the Group does not own 100% of the
ordinary shares of the Company. This may arise where the Group exercises control over the relevant activity of
the entity and can use this control to impact the variability of returns from the entity. The Group at times, must
exercise judgement as to whether the combination of control and exposure to variability of returns arising from
an entity means it is acting primarily as an agent, or as a principal for its own interests and should therefore
consolidate the entity into the results of the Group. There have been no instances in the period where significant
judgement was applied to reach a conclusion over whether or not an entity should be consolidated or not. The
Group did not consolidate any entity which individually had material non-controlling interest balances, and as
such, no further disclosure on non-controlling interests have been provided in this note.

**Financial support given to structured entities**

During the year, the Group issued no guarantees (2018: nil) to holders of notes issued by structured entities that
the Group consolidates.

Transfer between categories represents positions where the Group has originally held one type of instrument
relating to a portfolio, and subsequently increased or changed its interest in the portfolio, leading to the
requirement to consolidate the underlying structure onto the Group’s balance sheet. This leads to a change in the
classification of the portfolio investment held. The ‘portfolio restructure’ represents the restructure of a leveraged
structured deal to move to a de-levered position, and hence change the nature of the holding whilst extinguishing
related liabilities. Note that for real estate inventories, which are not financial instruments, the collections figure
above is analogous to total sales of inventories, and the net of collections and income from portfolio investments
– real estate inventories, is analogous to cost of sales of inventories. Sales of inventories are accounted for as
revenue under IFRS 15, as they are not financial instruments, but are presented alongside the other portfolio
investments for ease of reference.

The impact of IFRS 9 shown above is pre-tax. The post-tax impact is £14,000,000. The closing IFRS 9 position
has not been shown in the table above, as post-implementation the impact of IFRS 9 is subsumed within the net
impairment gain, and within income from portfolio investments at amortised cost.

The estimated future cash flows generated by portfolio investments are the key estimates/judgements in these
financial statements. Flexing the expected future gross cash flows by -1/+1% would impact the closing carrying
value of the portfolio investments as at 31 December 2019 by £11,020,000 (31 December 2018: £10,870,000).
Note that this sensitivity applies only to ‘Amortised Cost’ and ‘FVTPL’ portfolio investments, as this is not a
critical estimate for Real Estate portfolio assets.

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments**

**Risk management**

_Credit risk_

The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of non-performing and non-core consumer and
commercial unsecured, secured and real estate portfolios. Most portfolios by their nature are impaired at
acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections that in turn inform the ERCs on which the
portfolio carrying value is calculated. The ongoing risk is managed through a portfolio valuation process
including modelling current expectations of recoverability based on historical information of debt types, also
factoring in sale recoveries from collateral held on the secured portfolios. Further details of the forecasting
process are given in note 4.ii.

A pricing credit committee is in place which includes at least two members of the executive committee as well as
other key members from appropriate areas of the business, including oversight by the risk management function.
The Group also monitors its exposure to geographic concentration of assets. This process exists to scrutinise all
aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk through to the financial assumptions and
maximum bid price.

Where portfolio investments are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method, as part of the regular
monitoring process, the future cash flows in the ERCs are updated, with impairment gains/losses as a result of
changes to the estimated cash flows discounted at the EIR rate. Where portfolio investments are measured at
FVTPL, they are measured using a discounted cash flow model.

With the introduction of IFRS 9 in 2018, the Group’s management of credit risk is now further enhanced through
the modelling of multiple economic scenarios and the impact this is expected to have on future collections
performance. All of the Group’s portfolio investments have been classified as POCI, due to their credit-impaired
nature at the date of purchase. Therefore, no consideration has been given to the staging requirements of IFRS 9
for the Group’s portfolio assets.

In the UK, the Group constructed its own proprietary data repository in 2005 and has added additional historic
data on credit performance in the markets in which it operates. It now has tens of millions of records. This is used
to inform collections strategies and to help establish affordable repayment plans and settlements with our
customers across all geographies.

The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management
framework. The Group’s day-to-day working capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents.

**Credit quality analysis**

The Group’s purchased portfolio investments have been classified as purchased or originated as credit impaired
(POCI) as they include financial instruments that were credit-impaired at initial recognition, irrespective of
whether they are still credit-impaired at the reporting date. Expected credit losses (ECL) against POCI exposures
are always calculated on a lifetime basis (cumulative changes in ECL since initial recognition), and are reflected
in the credit-adjusted effective interest rate at initial recognition. As a result, no loss allowance is recognised at

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

inception. Subsequently, any changes in lifetime ECL after initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss.
The ECL calculation for POCI assets is based on an ECL over 84 months.

In determining ECLs the assessment of forward-looking economic assumptions, which are sourced from an
independent specialist forecasting company, the Group considers a number of macroeconomic scenarios,
including assumptions on unemployment, interest rates and CPI, and where appropriate HPI. These scenarios are
probability weighted according to their likely occurrence. The scenarios include a central scenario, based on the
current economic environment, as well as upside and downside scenarios. The estimation and application of this
forward-looking information requires significant judgement and is subject to appropriate internal governance.

Impairment gains/losses are changes to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt
portfolios as a result of reassessments of their estimated future cash flows and are recognised in the line item
‘impairment gains on portfolio investments at amortised cost’.

As all of the Group’s amortised cost portfolio assets are POCI, the cash flows are subject to reassessment each
period. For any portfolios which may be sold to a third-party from time to time, these are first subject to a cash
flow reassessment. Expected cash flows in such a scenario would be linked to the likely sale proceeds, meaning
that all such assets would be written to their expected selling price via an impairment gain/loss, before being
sold.

The following table sets out information about the credit quality of financial assets measured at amortised cost.

**Information on collateral held against amortised cost secured loans**

The following table stratifies credit exposures from secured portfolio investments held at amortised cost by
ranges of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. LTV is calculated as the ratio of the gross amount of the loan – or the
amount committed for loan commitments – to the value of the collateral. The valuation of the collateral excludes
any adjustments for obtaining and selling the collateral. The value of the collateral is based on the most recent
appraisals. LTV stratification is deemed a more relevant measure of the value of collateral held against secured
loans than gross collateral values held, which may include an amount which is not due to the Group upon
realisation. Comparative information for 2018 was not available in a comparable format.

In addition to the collateral included in the tables above, the Group holds other types of collateral and credit
enhancements, such as second charges and floating charges for which specific values are not generally available

**Assets obtained by taking possession of collateral**

There have been no instances of financial or non-financial assets obtained by the Group during the year by taking
possession of collateral held as security against portfolio investments.

The Group’s policy is to pursue timely realisation of the collateral in an orderly manner. The Group does not
generally use the non-cash collateral for its own operation.

**Significant increase in credit risk**

There are no significant increases or decreases in credit risk since origination as all portfolio investments have
been deemed to be purchased or originated credit impaired on initial recognition.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

As part of credit risk, the Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on
deposit with banks and foreign currency and derivative financial instruments. Counterparty risk with debt sellers
is managed through contractual arrangements and warranties.

The Group generally deposits cash and undertakes currency and derivative transactions with highly rated banks,
with limits on the level of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used
with board approval.

No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial derivatives. The maximum credit risk on
derivatives and trade receivables is the full carrying amount. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as

**Incorporation of forward looking information**

Note 4 includes a description of how the future cash flows are estimated for the Group’s portfolio investments.
Additionally, the Group incorporates forward looking information in the measurement of portfolio investments
held at amortised cost. The Group formulates six economic scenarios: a base case, which is the central scenario,
developed based on consensus forecasts, and five less likely scenarios – two upside, one stagnation and two
downside scenarios.

These scenarios are calculated by an external and independent macroeconomic forecasting company, and are
reviewed internally before being used in the Group’s models. To derive these scenarios, multiple sources of
information are considered, including economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and
monetary authorities in the countries where the Group operates, supranational organisations such as the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund, and
selected private-sector and academic forecasts.

The Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk for its portfolio investments and, using an
analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and
credit losses. The key drivers for credit risk for portfolio investments are: CPI growth, price indices,
unemployment rates and interest rates. For exposures to specific regions, the key drivers also include relevant
real estate prices.

The Group estimates each key driver for credit risk over the active forecast period of four years. This is followed
by a period of mean reversion of three years. A limitation of the approach which has been taken by the Group in
estimating the impact of multiple economic scenarios is that the correlations between macro-economic variables
and credit risk have been calculated using UK macro-economic data and UK historic portfolio performance but
applied to the wider population of amortised cost portfolios held across Europe. The exception to this is in
Portugal for secured assets, where specific correlations between Portuguese HPI and credit risk have been
calculated and used. Despite such limitations, the Group believes that this approach provides a materially correct
estimate of the impact of future economic scenarios across the Group.

Predicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on various portfolios of financial
assets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the past 10 years. Where correlations have not
been calculated for a specific country in which the Group operates, the closest comparable correlation from
another country is used.

**Treasury related risks**

The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board
delegates certain responsibilities to the Asset and Liability committee, which is chaired by the Group chief
financial officer, and is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority. Treasury activities and
compliance with treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic
independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main
financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and market
risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure the Group is properly funded, that
financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risks are managed
within set limits. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.

The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and
forward currency contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks
arising from the Group’s business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken, and written

options may only be used when matched by purchased options. No written options were entered into during 2019
(2018: £nil).

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by cash or another financial asset.

The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business
and its future plans for growth. The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a
specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt facilities and cash and cash equivalents to meet
contractual maturities on borrowing facilities plus an operational headroom. In addition, the Group aims to
ensure that leverage is within the target range of 3.0 to 3.5 times, there is an appropriate refinancing profile with
phased maturity dates and it has diversified funding sources with no over-reliance on a single or small group of
lenders or type of funding. At 31 December 2019, the Group’s senior secured notes, revolving credit facility and
asset backed security transaction had an average period to maturity of 4.8 years (2018: 5.8 years). Total cash and
undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2019 were £153 million (2018: £131 million).

The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review
meetings. Management has well established models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this
represents a key performance indicator of the business. The Group is highly cash generative with regular cash
receipts and portfolio purchases (except forward flows) are discretionary, which helps to mitigate liquidity risk.

The key measure used by the Group for managing liquidity risk is liquidity headroom, which includes cash and
cash equivalents and the headroom under the two committed facilities, being the revolving credit facility and the
asset backed security facility. Details of the liquidity headroom as at the reporting date and during the reporting
period were as follows.

The above tables includes a maturity analysis for financial assets that it holds as part of managing liquidity risk –
e.g. financial assets that are expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities – to
enable the user to evaluate the nature and extent of the Group’s and the Company’s liquidity risk

As part of the management of liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, the Group holds liquid assets
comprising cash and cash equivalents which can be readily used to meet liquidity requirements. In addition, the
Group maintains agreed lines of credit with other banks.

The non-derivative financial liabilities and financial assets are calculated based upon the undiscounted cash
flows, which include estimated interest payments. The analysis above includes the contractual cash flow for
borrowings and the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan. Where borrowings are subject to a
floating rate, an estimate of interest payable is taken. The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the
statement of financial position date.

The rate is derived from interest rate yield curves at the statement of financial position date.

In addition to the above, the Group has entered into certain forward flow agreements to which it has committed
to pay an estimated £24,600,000 (2018: £6,257,000) over the next five years.

**25. Risks arising from financial instruments continued**

The above table shows the gross contractual undiscounted cash flows receivable and payable on the derivative
financial instruments.

When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined with reference to
the projected interest rates as illustrated by the interest rate yield curves existing at the statement of financial
position date.

The derivative financial instruments are held across a number of counterparties; the largest net cash flow
exposure to a single counterparty at 31 December 2019 is £0.2 million (2018: £0.3 million).

**Financial assets pledged as collateral**

On 30 April 2019, the Group entered into a £100 million non-recourse committed asset backed securitisation
facility with an advance rate of 55% of 84-month ERC.

On the same date, the Group sold £137 million of ERC into AGL Fleetwood Limited, a wholly owned Arrow
Global Group subsidiary, and borrowed an initial amount of £75 million non-recourse funding at Libor plus
3.1%, under the facility. The assets of AGL Fleetwood Limited are pledged as security against the non-recourse
funding.

On 31 July 2019, the Group sold a further £44 million of ERC into AGL Fleetwood Limited and subsequently
borrowed an additional £25 million non-recourse funding on the same terms under the facility. The facility has a
five year term comprising an initial two year revolving period followed by a three year amortising period with an
option to extend the revolving period by one year, subject to lender consent.

As at 31 December 2019, the Group had pledged £94.2 million (2018: £nil) of portfolio investments as security
in connection with the non-recourse committed asset backed securitisation.

**Market risk**

Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk and are
considered further below. Note that the Group does not hold any trading portfolios for the purposes of these
disclosures.

**Interest-rate risk**

The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates on its borrowings, principally
on the floating rate senior secured notes, and therefore seeks to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of
techniques to fix interest rate costs, including fixed rate funding (predominantly longer-term bond funding), bank
borrowing loan draw down periods and interest rate hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the
interest rate costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time. Most hedging is for up to three
years.

If interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points this would have the following
impact:

Reduction in profit before taxation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(1,369)** (849)

This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:

 - the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative
financial instruments;

 - where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging
instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates; and

 - changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

**Currency risk**

The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income
statement exposure.

**Cash flow exposure**

The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are
highly likely to arise in the following 12 months. Where cash flow hedges have been entered into, they are
designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.

**Net asset exposure**

A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The Group limits its exposure to currency risk
on non-functional funding through forward currency contracts. The statement of financial position is reported in
Sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the
net assets of the Group. The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in Euro by funding
portfolio assets with Euro denominated borrowings where possible.

**Income statement exposure**

As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in Euro but translated into Sterling for
reporting purposes. The result for the period is translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk

therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative to the Euro will have an impact on the
consolidated result for the period. This risk is managed by the Group matching Euro asset purchases with Euro
funding wherever possible, to achieve an element of natural hedging.

If foreign exchange rates had been 10% stronger than Sterling than those at the statement of financial position
date and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s net assets and net profit for each significant
denomination of currency would increase/(decrease) as follows:


2018

**2019**
**£000**


**Currency**

**9,800** 6,837

The above assumes that there is no impact on retained earnings or equity arising from those items which are
naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability).

If foreign exchange rates had been 10% weaker than Sterling at the statement of financial position date and all
other variables were held constant, the Group’s net assets and net profit for each significant denomination of
currency would increase/(decrease) as follows:

**Capital risk management**

The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the
business. The Group is currently not required to hold regulatory capital but seeks to maintain leverage (calculated
as Secured Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA) of between 3.0 and 3.5 times.

The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong statement of financial position but at
the same time is providing a good return on equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure
that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of cash, cash equivalents debt and equity.

**Fair value estimation**

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted
market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values
using other valuation techniques.

For instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and required
judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other
risks affecting the specific instrument.

**Valuation models**

The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the
inputs used in making the measurements.

Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments.

Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in
active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are
considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly
observable from market data.

Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique
includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the
instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar
instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect the differences
between the instruments.

**Application to the Group’s financial assets and liabilities**

The fair value of amortised cost portfolio investments has been calculated by observing the compression in
market yields over time and applying the difference between current average market IRRs for the Group’s most
recent vintage, and applying this as a premium or discount to prior years’ vintages. This approach takes into

F-185

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**26. Financial assets and liabilities continued**

account changes in market pricing factors over time, while retaining the consideration of the individual
characteristics of each portfolio. As this calculation is based on unobservable inputs, these fair values would be
categorised as level 3 values. The primary unobservable input to which this valuation is sensitive to is the current
market rates for portfolios. A 1% rise/fall in this rate would lead to an uplift/reduction in fair value of
£20,251,000/(£19,438,000).

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and the revolving credit facility are deemed to be equal to their
carrying amount, and is considered a level 1 fair value.

The carrying value of other receivables and payables classified as financial assets/liabilities is deemed to be a
good approximation of their fair value, due to their short maturity and low credit risk. These would be considered
as a level 3 fair values.

The carrying value of asset-backed loans is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Given the
significant collateral underpinning the asset-backed loans, it is deemed appropriate to not adjust the carrying
value for expected credit losses when deriving the fair value of the loans. Additionally, the market rate is not
deemed to have materially changed since the issuance of the asset-backed loans. The fair value would be
categorised as a level 3 value.

The fair value of the senior secured notes has been calculated by reference to broker quotes that are based on
observable market inputs and therefore would be included as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy table should the
liability have been held at fair value.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as
a result of the derivative transaction. For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature,
the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

**Financial instruments measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy**

The following table analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the
fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values

There have been no transfers between level 2 or level 3. However, in the year it has been determined that
contingent consideration liabilities qualify as level 3 financial liabilities held at FVTPL. As such, they are now
included within this disclosure.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows
using interest rate yield curves and forward foreign exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 2019.

Total gains on portfolio investments recognised at FVTPL have been presented in the income statement as ‘Fair
value gains on portfolio investments at FVTPL’. The fair value of portfolio investments recognised as FVTPL
has been calculated by using a discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the
calculation of portfolio investments categorised as Level 3 In the fair value hierarchy are estimated future cash
flows (ERCs), derived from management forecasts and the discount rate appropriate to the investment and the
anticipated rate of return.

The total 84 month ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at FVTPL is £255,844,000, with an
average discount rate of 12.4%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at FVTPL of £1,698,000/ (£1,698,000). An increase/decrease in the
discount rate of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held at
FVTPL of (£5,325,000)/£5,637,000.

The total ERC value for the Group’s portfolio investments held at amortised cost is ££1,428,163,000, with an
average discount rate of 22.9%. An increase/decrease in ERC of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the
carrying value of portfolio investments held at amortised costs of £9,322,000/(£9,322,000). An increase/decrease
in the discount rate of 1% would lead to an increase/decrease in the carrying value of portfolio investments held
at amortised of (£14,114,000)/£14,613,000. A full reconciliation between the opening and closing portfolio
investments held at FVTPL has been provided in note 24. For a fuller description of how the future cash flows
are estimated, please refer to note 4.

Contingent consideration has arisen as a result of business combinations in the prior periods. In the current
period, the contingent consideration was remeasured, partly due to the renegotiation of the terms of the deferred
consideration in the period. Of the closing balance, €10 million relates to the acquisition of Norfin and has a
minimum/maximum pay-out of €5 million/€10 million. The remainder relates to the acquisition of Drydens, with
a minimum/maximum pay-out of £nil/£5 million.

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy**

The following table analyses financial instruments not measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in
the fair value hierarchy into which the measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values
recognised in the statement of financial position. All of the Group’s financial instruments not measured at fair
value fall into hierarchy level 3.

**Forward foreign exchange contracts**

It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency
payments and receipts and exposure to currency rate fluctuations. The total notional amount of outstanding
foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2019 is £nil (2018: £35,300,000). As
at 31 December 2018, these comprise foreign currency contracts to sell Sterling and purchase Euros for a total
notional of £35,300,000 and had maturity dates to March 2019. These contracts were designated and were
effective as cash flow hedges under IFRS 9 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof was deferred in equity and the
fair value recycled to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income during 2019. In such hedge
relationships, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is counterparty credit risk, of both parties,
including the Group. There are no other material sources of hedge ineffectiveness. During the year, £8,000

(2018: £1,202,000) was recycled from equity to the statement of profit or loss, within finance costs, and other
comprehensive income as a result of maturity of the short dated foreign exchange swaps during the year and an
amount of £100,000 has been charged to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2018:
£291,000).

There have been no transfers in or out of level 3. However, in the year it has been determined that deferred
consideration liabilities qualify as level 3 financial liabilities held at amortised cost. As such, they are now
included within this disclosure. The statement of financial position value of the Group’s portfolio investments not
measured at fair value, is derived from discounted cash flows generated by an internal model. For a fuller
description of how the future cash flows are estimated, please refer to note 4. Following acquisition, the fair
value will move directionally in line with carrying amount but may deviate as market conditions change.

The Group has an established control framework covering the measurement of portfolio investment carrying
values. This includes regular monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee,
which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a semiannual basis, reviews actual against forecast gross money multiple, approves the latest ERC forecast, assesses
the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition. A reconciliation of the opening to
closing balances for the year of the portfolio investments can be seen in note 24.

The Company did not hold any other financial instruments not measured at fair value for which a fair value needs
to be calculated (2018: none).

**Interest rate hedging**

The Group has Euro interest rate swaps, which hedge floating 3 month Euribor with a zero percent floor to a
fixed rate and have been designated as cash flow hedges, in place for a Sterling equivalent notional amount of
£340,237,000 (2018: £453,811,000). In 2018 and 2019, these interest rate swaps covered current borrowings,
being the floating rate senior secured Euro notes. An amount of £286,000 has been credited to equity for the
Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2018: £291,000 charge). All hedge relationships have been
effective in the year and are expected to maintain effectiveness.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed based upon the relative changes in cash flows arising from the specified portion
of the Group’s floating rate borrowings, relative to the change in cash flows of the interest rate swaps (using the
hypothetical derivative method). The hedges are deemed to be highly effective in the current and prior period. In
such hedge relationships, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is counterparty credit risk, of both
parties, including the Group. There are no other material sources of hedge ineffectiveness.

Interest rate swaps in place at the statement of financial position date are designated, and are effective under
IFRS 9, as cash flow hedges, and their fair value has been recognised in the hedging reserve. All interest rate

F-188

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**26. Financial assets and liabilities continued**

swaps are categorised as highly effective and no charge has been made to the statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income in the year (2018: no charge). No re-classifications into or out of the hedging reserve
were made in relation to interest rate swaps.

The Company did not hold any interest rate swaps at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: £nil). No charge
has been made to the Company’s equity.

The calculation methodology of Euribor changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and
Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to Euribor under the European Union Benchmarks
Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use Euribor after 1 January 2020 for both existing and
new contracts. The Group expects that Euribor will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable
future. The Group does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. For these reasons, the
Group does not consider its cash flow hedges of the Euribor benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by the
interest rate benchmark reform at 31 December 2019. No hedge relationships have any exposure to LIBOR.

At 31 December 2019, the Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates.

**27. Unconsolidated structured entities**

Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that the Group has an interest in, but does not
control. The Group uses structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate acquisitions of portfolios
in accordance with local law, to allow co-investment with other parties, or to implement the financing required to
acquire portfolios.

In addition to exposures to unconsolidated structured entities, the Group also undertakes Asset Management and
Servicing activities for certain structured entities in which the Group has no other interests. Such activities are
charged at a market rates, on terms normal for the industry, and are considered to be a typical customer/supplier
relationship per the meaning of this term set out in ‘IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’.

The maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of the instruments summarised above, due to the nature of
the Group’s holdings at the fact that no additional support has been provided or committed to the vehicles.

Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group holds an interest are typically financed by a form of junior
profit participation note, and in some instances also have senior secured or senior unsecured liabilities to which
the junior positions are subordinated.

**Share incentive plan (SIP)**

In 2019 (and previously April 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014), the Group offered to all UK employees the
opportunity to participate in a SIP, where the Company gives the participating employees one matching share for
each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using the participating employees’ gross salaries. The
shares vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees required to stay in
employment for the vesting period to receive the shares.

On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant
date price per share of £2.29 as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vested in 2017, with
restrictions attached to these shares ceasing to have effect from the vesting date.

**Long - term incentive plan (LTIP)**

On 20 June 2019, nil-cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 200% of
base salary. The LTIP awards vest at the end of three years subject to the achievement of performance
conditions. On the same dates, tax-qualifying options were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’)
to eligible UK employees.

On 27 June 2018, 31 March 2017, 8 April 2016 and 19 May 2016, 30 June 2015 and 15 June 2015, nil-cost share
options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. The LTIP awards vest
at the end of three years subject to the achievement of performance conditions. On the same dates, tax-qualifying
options were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’) to eligible UK employees.

Each CSOP option is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost option part of the awards. If
a CSOP option is exercised at a gain, the number of shares that may be delivered under the above associated
nil-cost option under the LTIP will be reduced at exercise by the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value
of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant of the CSOP option. Awards
granted on or after 27 June 2018 awards do not include the right to receive a dividend equivalent.

existing £220 million 5.125% fixed rate notes due 2024. As part of the transaction Arrow Global Finance Plc also
redeemed its €230 million 4.75% over three-month EURIBOR floating rate senior secured notes.

The proceeds were used to fund the purchase price for the acquisition of Parr Credit, partially repay drawings
under the revolving credit facility and to fund transaction costs and the redemption of the 2023 notes.

In 2018, bond refinancing costs comprised £18,658,000 incurred on the early redemption of the €230 million
notes due 2023, of which £13,623,000 was a cash cost related to the call premium. The remaining £5,035,000
was due to a non-cash write-off of related transactions fees, relating to the 2023 notes.

The Euro senior notes and Sterling senior notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Group.

**Revolving credit facility**

On 4 January 2018 the commitments under the revolving credit facility were increased from £215 million to
£255 million. The maturity of the facility was extended to 2 January 2023 and the margin reduced to 2.5%.

On 1 November 2018, the commitments under the revolving credit facility were increased from £255 million to
£285 million.

On 26 February 2019, the revolving credit facility was extended to 2024, with no change in margin.

**Asset backed securitisation**

On 30 April 2019, the Group entered into a £100 million non-recourse committed asset backed securitisation
facility with an advance rate of 55% of 84-month ERC. On the same date, the Group sold £137 million of ERC
into AGL Fleetwood Limited, a wholly owned Arrow Global Group subsidiary, and borrowed an initial amount
of £75 million non-recourse funding at Libor plus 3.1% under the facility.

On 31 July 2019, the Group sold a further £44 million of ERC into AGL Fleetwood Limited and subsequently
borrowed an additional £25 million non-recourse funding on the same terms under the facility. The facility has a
five year term comprising an initial two year revolving period followed by a three year amortising period with an
option to extend by one year, subject to lender consent.

**30. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking**

**Current year acquisitions**

_a. Drydens Limited (Drydens)_

On 8 April 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Drydens. Drydens is a provider of legal
services, the acquisition of which will broaden the Group’s UK range of servicing capabilities and skills across
consumer and commercial litigation, probate and insolvency. The total undiscounted consideration for the
acquisition is £11,115,000 including deferred and contingent consideration.

Contingent consideration is payable at various times within two years from completion of the transaction upon
the satisfaction of three mutually exclusive conditions which are based upon the business achieving certain
targets around future volumes and the successful migration of Group accounts. The targets for contingent
consideration are not linked to the post-acquisition employment status of the sellers, and is not considered to be a
post-employment benefit arrangement with the former owners.

Of the £4,262,000 contingent consideration the gross undiscounted amounts are made up as follows:

 - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the successful migration of Arrow accounts. The payment range could
be anywhere between £nil and £2,000,000 with the final amount to be agreed upon in April 2020;

 - Up to £2,000,000 is contingent upon the performance of Arrow placed accounts against the jointly agreed
business plan. The payment range could be anywhere between £nil and £2,000,000 with the final amount to
be agreed upon in April 2021; and

 - £1,000,000 is contingent upon winning Proceeds of Crime Act servicing deal from the UK Government
before 8 April 2020. If the deal is not won the payment is forfeited.

**Effect of the acquisition**

The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.

**30. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued**

An intangible asset of £688,000 has been recognised at acquisition, being the fair value after appropriate
discounting, of expected cash flows arising from existing customer relationships. The gross contractual
outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ was materially equal to their carrying amount, with no
material balances not expected to be collected upon.

Goodwill of £14,519,000 was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reason for the acquisition was to
broaden the Group’s range of servicing capabilities in the UK.

In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2019, Drydens contributed income of £3,650,000 and profit after
tax contribution of £1,165,000 to the consolidated results for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on
1 January 2019, Group total income would have been higher by an estimated £1,167,000 and profit after tax
would have been lower by an estimated £24,000.

**Prior year acquisitions**

undiscounted consideration for the acquisition is €24,924,000 (£21,917,000) including deferred and contingent
consideration.

Contingent consideration is split into three tranches and is based on the three future anniversaries of the
transaction. It is included at its fair value, at the amount contractually agreed. The contingent consideration is
based on the business meeting certain income targets each year.

after tax contribution of £2,100,000 to the consolidated results for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on
1 January 2018, Group total income would have been higher by an estimated £2,600,000 and profit after tax
would have been lower by an estimated £400,000.

Goodwill of £5,164,000 was created as a result of this acquisition. The primary reason for the acquisition was to
enable the Group to take advantage of opportunities in the small ticket UK commercial real estate secured loan
market.

The gross contractual outstanding amounts of ‘trade and other receivables’ was materially equal to their carrying
amount, with no material balances not expected to be collected upon. In the period from acquisition to
31 December 2018, Bergen contributed no material income or profit after tax contribution to the consolidated
results for the year.

**Measurement period**

Whilst the Group believes the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments to be complete, IFRS 3 allows a
measurement period of up to one year after acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and
circumstances that were made available to the Group at the acquisition date. Certain adjustments in respect of the
fair value of the opening balance sheets acquired and the discounted fair value of consideration paid on EI and
Norfin have been made in the period (see note 13). If any additional changes are required within this
measurement period, these will be reflected in the 2020 half year results of the Group.
