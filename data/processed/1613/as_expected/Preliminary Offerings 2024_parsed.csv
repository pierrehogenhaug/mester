1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1097,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1097.1,,1097.1.1,,"In this offering memorandum, we present certain historical financial data of the Issuer and the AMC business. This offering memorandum contains the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). This offering memorandum also contains the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business. The AMC business includes historically a product group of Micro Focus International Limited (“Micro Focus”) and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OpenText Connectivity business (“OT Connectivity”), a product group of OpenText. OpenText acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus on January 31, 2023 (the “MF Acquisition”). The AMC business has historically operated as part of Micro Focus or, following acquisition thereof, OpenText and not as a standalone company. The audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are presented on a “carve-out” basis from (i) Micro Focus’s accounting records for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 and (ii) OpenText’s accounting records for the period from and after February 1, 2023, using the historical results of operations, cash flows, assets and liabilities of the AMC business. For the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023, the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business exclude OT Connectivity. The audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business include allocations of corporate expenses and shared expenses from Micro Focus for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 (prior to the MF Acquisition) and OpenText for the period from and after February 1, 2023 (following the MF Acquisition). These allocations reflect significant assumptions and the combined financial statements may not fully reflect what the AMC business’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had it been a standalone company during the periods presented. As a result, the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are not necessarily indicative of the AMC business’s future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as expressly noted, OpenText has not prepared or reviewed any information about the AMC business or the combined business for this offering memorandum or confirmed the accuracy of the information included in this offering memorandum. Additionally, the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business that are included in this offering memorandum have not been separately filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by OpenText.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We have included certain financial measures that are not based on GAAP in this offering memorandum, including Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue, Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit, EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion with respect to the Issuer and the AMC business, as applicable (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Metrics”). We believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating ----- performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We believe that they provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures. We use these measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. Certain of our Non-GAAP Metrics have been calculated utilizing accounting principles not consistent with GAAP, including recognizing revenue on an Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) basis rather than in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). A primary difference between ARR and ASC 606 is the accounting for license revenue in our subscription or term license arrangements, which is annualized and recognized over the contract term under our ARR method, while recognized at a point in time, generally at the inception of the contract term, under ASC 606. Our use of the Non-GAAP Metrics varies from others in our industry. Our Non-GAAP Metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), revenue or other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows or as measures of liquidity. Our Non-GAAP Metrics have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - non-cash compensation, including in connection with certain acquisitions, is and will remain an element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - such measures reflect estimated cost savings and synergies that may not be achieved; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In this offering memorandum, we disclose the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the Issuer and the AMC business on a standalone and pro forma basis, as applicable. Some of the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business were prepared by us based on certain financial information obtained through our financial diligence process. The methodology for preparing such financial information is different than the methodology used by OpenText to prepare the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business (including with respect to the allocation of shared costs) and such Non-GAAP Metrics should therefore not be viewed as substitutes for the AMC business’s results as reported under GAAP. OpenText neither prepared nor reviewed these Non-GAAP Metrics, and OpenText does not utilize any such Non-GAAP Metrics in its own reporting with respect to the AMC business. We have not yet closed the AMC Acquisition, and the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business are therefore subject to certain adjustments and changes after we close the AMC Acquisition and integrate the AMC business into our own business. ----- For a more detailed discussion and reconciliations of our Non-GAAP Metrics to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, see “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.” The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, in particular with respect to (a) the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures (as described above) and (b) the presentation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” In addition, in “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information,” the “Pro Forma” information presented under the “Pro Forma” column for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects certain adjustments as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” that were not applied to the “Pro Forma” information presented under the “Historical” columns for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, including Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin and certain other Non-GAAP Metrics. These metrics are therefore not fully comparable. Furthermore, the Non-GAAP Metrics that include the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not include the same pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as set forth in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and represent a management combined presentation whereby the Non-GAAP Metrics of the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 were added together with the Non-GAAP Metrics of Rocket for the same year, with certain adjustments as described in “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"Rocket is a leading global enterprise software provider with a broad portfolio of products that help corporations, government agencies, and other organizations run their mission-critical IT operations. We enable small and large enterprises in many industries to maximize their data, systems and infrastructure to deliver critical services that power our modern world. Our software runs, optimizes and protects our customers’ applications, servers and databases, and integrates these core platforms with the rest of the enterprise, while providing a full-stack of modernization solutions. Our products enable customers to carry out their most mission-critical business functions, such as processing payment transactions at global financial institutions and maintaining healthcare records at hospitals and insurance companies. Since our founding over 30 years ago, we have cultivated a customer-centric culture with strategic investments in research and development (“R&D”) that provide a wide range of solutions to meet customers’ evolving needs. We have evolved from solely maintaining legacy infrastructure to facilitating modernization journeys to connect mainframe to the hybrid cloud environment. We have accomplished this evolution through substantial R&D efforts, highlighted by over $500 million in investments into R&D since 2020, as well as multiple acquisitions that have expanded our modernization offering. Given our focus on supporting our customers’ mission-critical business functions, our products address deeply embedded technologies that sit at the core of enterprise IT infrastructure. These systems have evolved over multiple decades and, particularly for our largest customers, represent billions of dollars of cumulative custom application development and IT infrastructure investment. As enterprises look to the future, hybrid remains vital to enabling the deployment of cloud environments as it incorporates client server computing, cloud-based platforms, and modern connectivity and portability. We seek to enable our customers to experience the best of both the cloud and the mainframe, putting relevant workloads in the cloud while leveraging the mainframe for its best features – security, reliability, and governance. Our strategy is to modernize without disruption, meeting customers where they are in their modernization journey. By utilizing our product portfolio, customers can modernize effectively, even incrementally, integrating new technologies while preserving and leveraging the robust foundation already in place for a seamless technological evolution. We believe this approach dramatically lowers risk and improves success rates of IT system modernization projects. As the pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, we believe our customers will increasingly look to us to extract greater value from existing IT systems and applications through innovation, integration, optimization and modernization. Today, Rocket is organized into three main business units focused on Infrastructure Modernization, Data Modernization and Application Modernization. While each business unit has its own technical requirements and products, we go to market using a holistic approach to solving our customers’ problems, utilizing solutions across our business units to help drive operating efficiencies among overlapping buying centers to best position us to drive future growth. These business units are as follows: _Infrastructure Modernization: Our Infrastructure Modernization business unit represents approximately_ 55% of our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It comprises software solutions built for integrating and optimizing mainframe workloads, mitigating security and compliance risks and optimizing storage. Organizations can leverage our range of solutions to support mainframe security and ----- compliance in the face of new threats and deliver optimized mainframe performance management and interoperability. The mainframe continues to be an integral part of modern-day IT infrastructure and provides a reliable architecture for high-volume data processing and transactions. Mainframes provide a level of five 9s of availability (99.999%), which is several orders of magnitude higher than alternative distributed servers, making mainframes the optimal platform for mission-critical processes. Additionally, mainframes are uniquely engineered to process millions of input and output calculations per second, which is a key difference from distributed servers that are designed to be more general purpose, limiting their ability to perform a specialized task extremely well. Consequently, mainframes provide a range of advantages over distributed systems that are likely to persist, and we believe organizations in regulated and data intensive industries will continue to rely on mainframe systems to process high-volume, missioncritical activity at the core of their IT infrastructures. _Data Modernization: Our Data Modernization business unit represents approximately 18% of our_ standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It provides software solutions to connect mission-critical data residing on the mainframe and distributed systems to advanced applications and compute workloads running on private and public cloud environments. As organizations increasingly adopt a hybrid cloud infrastructure approach to operations, effectively navigating the complexities of data governance and compliance while maximizing data utilization is critical. Our solutions address this challenge by eliminating data siloes to enhance decision-making and customer experience while maintaining strong data governance, security, scalability and dynamic availability. For example, one of our key products, Mobius, enables customers to integrate seamlessly with third-party repositories, facilitating secure and efficient data movement between modern and legacy systems. Our track record of successfully integrating acquisitions within this business unit highlights our commitment to providing an end-to-end offering that reframes customer engagement strategies and paves the way for future growth. _Application Modernization: Our Application Modernization business unit represents the remaining 27% of_ our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It is comprised of a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for legacy applications. While Application Modernization covers both distributed offmainframe platforms and mainframe environments, many of the most important back-end applications for large enterprises still reside on the mainframe and have yet to be modernized. With key offerings including database management, DevOps, and low-code application development platforms, we enable organizations to efficiently deliver reliable, scalable and secure applications to support their core business needs. One of our key innovations has been to enable enterprise adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern development practices even for legacy systems. Across these three business units, we serve over 12,500 end-user customers, pro forma for the AMC Acquisition. Our customer base spans every major industry vertical and includes some of the largest companies in the world, including 43 of the Fortune 50, as of 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). Our customer base is highly diversified with the top ten Rocket-led customers representing just 14% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). In addition to these deeply embedded and long-term customer relationships, we have also cultivated a number of partnerships that are critical to our business. Our largest partnership is with IBM. We generate approximately 23% of our revenue through IBM-led sales. Through a series of organic R&D investments, acquisitions, joint development efforts and a strong go-to-market (“GTM”) partnership, we have become one of IBM’s most trusted software partners. This partnership has evolved over 30 years and is driven primarily by our expertise in mainframe and mid-range servers of which IBM is a major manufacturer. Our software enhances and creates efficiencies for IBM’s customers and extends the life of IBM’s core platforms. In partnership with IBM, we develop and support core software offerings in their portfolio, freeing IBM to redirect their R&D spend to other areas. As part of our partnership with IBM, numerous Rocket products are re-branded as IBM products and sold through their global salesforce. While we are committed to remaining a high-quality business partner to IBM and extending the lifetime value of core IBM-led products, we are working to increase the share of Rocket-led sales to further diversify our revenue. Our Rocket-led GTM strategy, whether executed directly or through our channel partners, allows us to provide best-in ----- class support to our customers in managing their mainframe and modernization journey, particularly as they move towards a hybrid cloud environment. We are headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and maintain a large global footprint with significant operations in North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. As of December 31, 2023 we had 2,200 employees (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition) worldwide with a presence in 13 global offices. Following the AMC Acquisition, we expect to have approximately 3,000 Rocketeers and 20 global offices. This worldwide coverage provides us with access to economies of scale, lower cost offshore operations, high-growth emerging markets and global support for our increasingly global customer base.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Acquisition of Application Modernization and Connectivity,9.2.1,,"On November 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the AMC business of OpenText, which includes historically a product group of Micro Focus and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OT Connectivity business, a product group of OpenText, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments. For more information, see “––The AMC Acquisition.” The AMC business has been a leader in application modernization for many years with a focus on mainframe replatforming solutions that help with the migration and operation of mainframe workloads to distributed and cloud environments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the AMC business generated Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue of $504 million and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA of $307 million. AMC Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue is comprised of (x) for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $355 million of ARR, $108 million of perpetual license revenue and $13 million of professional service revenue, and (y) for the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately $364 million of ARR, $121 million of perpetual license revenue and $20 million of professional services revenue. The AMC business operates within five portfolio segments that form a comprehensive suite for mainframe application development, maintenance and modernization: _Enterprise Suite: The AMC business’s Enterprise Suite business unit represents approximately 18% of its_ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution is the AMC business’s fastest growing product line, providing end-to-end mainframe workload migration tools including migration analysis, test and deployment tools and an enterprise server that emulates the mainframe environment in the cloud. The Enterprise Suite helps organizations move mainframe workloads to run on distributed environments with a significantly lower degree of code change relative to other complex migration options like refactoring. Within the Enterprise Suite, four core tools address different stages of workload migration and application development. The Analyzer, Developer and Enterprise Test Server are focused on delivering diagnostic tools, modern Integrated Development Environments (“IDE”) and virtual test environments. The Enterprise Server provides a multi-platform production environment to replatform IBM z/OS applications. The revenue derived from Enterprise Server is highly recurring in nature and allows for an emulated mainframe on cloud environments with the ability to run mission-critical applications. _COBOL: The AMC business’s Common Business Oriented Language (“COBOL”) business unit represents_ approximately 36% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution enables organizations to develop, maintain and deploy COBOL based applications across the enterprise using modern DevOps tools and platforms. COBOL is a legacy programming language that is integral to the majority of mission-critical applications. As most developers lack experience working in COBOL, a modern set of DevOps tools enables enterprises to modernize and update their most important applications. The AMC business’s tools provide an IDE for analyzing and editing COBOL in applications primarily offmainframe, providing developers with visualizations and coding environments similar to modern IDEs. As one indicator of the AMC business’s market position, the AMC business is the only official COBOL compiler available on Cloud Service Providers’ (“CSPs”) marketplaces. _Host Connectivity: The AMC business’s Host Connectivity business unit represents approximately 32% of_ its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution includes mainframe terminal emulators and plugins for application access, process automation and security solutions. Customer use cases include providing flexible access to mission-critical applications running on mainframe environments via modern, distributed systems (desktop, web and mobile) in a secure and compliant manner (i.e. multi factor ----- authentication). The AMC business’s Host Connectivity tools provide a broad number of options that allow for significant customization to deliver strong, auditable and compliant security that meets organizations’ requirements. _Mainframe Application Development Life Cycle Management (“ADLM”): The AMC business’s Mainframe_ ADLM business unit represents approximately 11% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides mainframe source code change, configuration and management enabling organizations to modernize and integrate mainframes across new technologies and platforms. This results in shorter app delivery cycles, stronger security and increased productivity. Customer use cases include version control functionality to track changes made to source code (i.e. ChangeMan ZMF), change management workflow, release management and automation, automated testing, auditing and reporting. _CORBA: The AMC business’s Common Object Request Broker Architecture (“CORBA”) business unit_ represents approximately 3% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides middleware for communication across distributed applications. CORBA add-on solutions enable any CORBA application to take advantage of new deployment models, including cloud, containers and virtual environments or to extend and re-use existing CORBA resources without prior knowledge of CORBA technology. These solutions are used in telecommunications for managing network elements and the integration of different vendor equipment, in military and defense for building command and control systems and in finance for trading and risk management systems. The AMC Acquisition represents a highly complementary addition to our product portfolio, with the AMC business expected to further build out a more diverse modernization portfolio that aligns with customer demands and allows us to meet our customers wherever they are on their modernization journey. The AMC Acquisition is expected to achieve key strategic objectives, including: - Expanding the product portfolio with a stronger, more comprehensive modernization offering that is able to meet customers at any stage of their IT modernization journey, whether modernizing in place, migrating select workloads to hybrid environments or replatforming; - Providing a full-stack of products and solutions to enable end-to-end modernization without the disruption of existing workflows and allow customers to derive value from their decades of investment in core applications; - Expanding customer reach through deeper and broader customer engagement across Fortune 2000 accounts for greater retention and cross-selling. A more comprehensive and complete offering solidifies Rocket as the strategic partner of choice to address customer needs, tapping into developer-led decisions and guiding customers through their modernization journey over time, ultimately expanding Rocket’s relevance; - Tapping into CSP budget pools through the AMC business’s replatforming capabilities, augmenting our existing hybrid cloud solutions suite and expanding our footprint with CSPs including Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure as preferred replatforming partners; - Expanding our global reach, with a stronger presence in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific, and Latin American channels, thus diversifying our revenue sources and redistributing geographic concentrations; and - Combining R&D engines to drive increased innovation, better modernization capabilities and more elegant solutions to further accelerate a shifty to hybrid cloud technology. The AMC business’s additional resources for innovation will foster continuous R&D innovation through the application of emerging technologies like generative artificial intelligence. Acquiring the AMC business’s replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs, including Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure, is expected to enable us to tap into new budget pools and augment our existing hybrid cloud solutions suite. Rocket has broken down the boundaries of on-premises and cloud ----- computing so that businesses can connect IT systems and modern applications. The seamless data flow, data integration and continuous enhancements create benefits like streamlined processes, improved efficiencies, and better return on investment so that customers can be more dynamic, secure, and agile in the face of an increasingly complex IT and business environment.

This move is expected to further strengthen our position as the partner of choice for mission-critical IT modernization.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our GTM Strategy,9.3.1,,"Our marketing and GTM strategies are driven, first and foremost, to deliver the right solutions to customers, regardless of channel. To that end, our sales and marketing efforts are bifurcated between our Rocket-led products and our IBMled products, each of which have their own strategies. Our Rocket-led products are sold through two primary avenues: (1) direct to customer through our centralized customer success, support and delivery teams and (2) channel partners. - Our direct sales force and marketing investment, which is focused on Rocket-led solutions, is shifting the dialogue from mainframe buying centers to a Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) and Chief Product Officer (“CPO”) strategy covering the expanse of Rocket use cases. We rely on marketing to drive brand awareness, generate leads across our growth product areas and support subscription and maintenance renewals by reinforcing the value delivered by our new releases and product innovation. Through our 30-year operating history and over 50 acquisitions, we have a strong base of customers that we continually look to serve with our growing portfolio of solutions. Our sales force targets both existing customers and new logo opportunities and is comprised of a global set of enterprise sales professionals focused on account relationships. Our enterprise sales professionals are product specialists who focus on selling our solutions with our solutions engineers providing technical guidance to customers throughout the sales process. This team handles new sales as well as up-sells and cross-sells within existing accounts, further driving revenue expansion. Renewals of existing maintenance contracts and subscriptions are handled by our centralized renewal team, who have helped to drive our consistently high renewal rates. - In addition to our direct sales force, our Rocket-led sales organization also leads our strategic alliances. Our 10 strategic channel partner relationships consist of resellers, distributors and systems integrators who embed our solutions in other software applications and help to deliver new solutions to market. Our strong relationships with Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”) and Managed Service Providers (“MSPs”) enable us to better reach both current and potential customers, and these strong MSP relationships also support customers using MSPs to manage their mainframe. For our IBM-led products, we have a dedicated sales enablement team across the IBM Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) product segments, all backed by a 30-year longstanding partnership driving us and IBM to partner on opportunities and deployments. These joint Rocket-IBM sales and marketing initiatives allow us to drive demand, refine messaging, enable sales and strengthen win rates for our IBM-led products, which continue to have strong retention rates supported by the strength of our partnership with IBM. In addition to benefits that we realize from the partnership, IBM also leverages us to support the broader mainframe industry and expand value delivered from incumbent involvement. Ultimately, our powerful GTM strategy is bolstered by a centralized customer success and support effort with global coverage, a dedicated team focused on renewals and driving upsell and cross-sell opportunities across the installed base, numerous strategic alliances that help market and distribute our solutions and a robust partnership with IBM. The combination of these factors forms our strong customer success engine and continues to help us drive strong retention rates. We have further built our business to serve the expanding needs of our customers and address growing budget pools that are focused on digital transformation. We’ve transitioned from a focus on providing solutions to the head of infrastructure to addressing a head of applications or a Chief Data Officer who is focused on driving revenue generation of their business. Whether it is the CIO or the Chief Data Officer, we have solutions that address their ----- mission-critical challenges and our GTM approach ensures that we serve the different needs of our expanded buyer set. The combined forces of Rocket and the AMC business are expected to create a broader product offering that serves the entire modernization continuum, all in a single partner. As one example of how the AMC Acquisition will help broaden our product offering and modernization capabilities, we expect the AMC business to provide us with additional GTM channels to tap into CSP budget pools given the AMC business’s strength in replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs. We believe this will further elevate Rocket’s status with MSPs, CSPs and other key ecosystem participants, further strengthening and differentiating our GTM strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.1,,"_Deep and Embedded Portfolio of Solutions Meets Customer Needs Across Environments_ Since our founding, we have focused strategically on innovation to develop and enhance our software solutions to consistently meet our customers’ evolving needs. Our portfolio of solutions represents a full-stack of purpose-built products tailored to various end markets. Within each of these environments, we address customer pain points at every layer of their IT system. This ranges from the core IT infrastructure (i.e. software tooling for the mainframe itself or an embedded database) to newly developed applications that are open source in nature and run in the cloud but need to integrate with the more traditional components of a customer’s IT system.

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.1,,"_Embrace Hybrid Cloud to Enable Enterprises to Unlock New Capabilities and Growth Opportunities and Simultaneously Optimize Mission-Critical Systems_ Through our strategy of enabling enterprises to embrace and innovate with hybrid cloud, companies can deploy, execute and manage workloads, applications and data agnostic of their chosen infrastructure in a seamless and transparent manner from mainframe to cloud. This approach allows enterprises to not only maximize the full potential and value of their data stored on mainframe, but also leverage that data to drive decisions and insights from cloudnative capabilities, including AI, ML and advanced analytics. One of our key innovations has been to enable enterprise adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern development practices even for legacy systems and which we expect the AMC Acquisition to further enhance. This will empower our customers as they pursue their modernization journeys, and we are right there with them. Ultimately, this narrative aligns the technology investments made by enterprises with their key business outcomes, providing customers with a complete lifecycle of solutions and letting them focus on business without worrying about the constraints of their current technology architecture. _Focus on R&D and Investment in Product Portfolio_ Since 2020, we have invested $521 million in R&D initiatives. With nearly 1,900 Rocketeer Engineers (pro forma for the AMC Acquisition) and an R&D presence in five continents, our R&D investment is the cornerstone of our ability to innovate, enabling us to better address customer needs, retain existing accounts and attract new business. It also allows us to provide full-stack solutions to our customers, which we believe, in conjunction with our powerful GTM team and strategy, will ultimately drive strong retention rates among our installed bases. Our customer-centric R&D shows our true understanding of the different needs of our customers and buyers who are looking to modernize their infrastructure, reinforcing, and magnifying our commitment to innovation. Additionally, because we’ve scaled the business so significantly through both organic and inorganic growth, we’ve managed to achieve significant scale efficiency in our R&D investments. _Support Full-Stack Modernization and Tap into Multiple Budget Pools_ We provide a full-stack of infrastructure, application, and data modernization solutions, allowing companies to integrate legacy and distributed systems with modern cloud capabilities. This full-stack of IT system modernization solutions allows us to tap into multiple budget pools, including those covered by the CIO, Chief Data Officer, Head of Applications, Chief Information Security Officer, Head of Infrastructure and more. With our suite of products and solutions, we can help companies ensure that their existing infrastructure is able to successfully deliver digital transformation initiatives and provide competitive advantages; deliver new mission-critical applications across hybrid infrastructures; govern and access key data and content to strengthen customer relationships and ensure compliance; and drive key initiatives to secure and protect data across the broader enterprise. This multi-layered approach opens corporate budgets beyond the mainframe and infrastructure-centric buyer and expands our wallet share to larger digital transformation initiatives that we can access through upsell and cross-sell opportunities. ----- _Maintain Our Strong Operational Efficiency and Profitability_ Our focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management has helped us to maintain consistently high Adjusted EBITDA margins. This commitment to cost control has enabled our ongoing investments in R&D to further expand our solution footprint. We believe this continued emphasis on cost control results in attractive operating leverage and cash flow generation. _Pursue Accretive Acquisitions to Further Supplement Our Portfolio_ Over our history, we have completed more than 50 acquisitions and developed a track record of successfully integrating acquired companies. Acquisitions have historically been completed at attractive multiples and have allowed us to further enhance our product portfolio. Our multi-prong approach to evaluating potential acquisitions includes identification of (1) Solution Enhancement, (2) Solution Expansion and (3) Synergy Realization, which allows us to be intentional and methodical throughout both the discovery and vetting processes. We focus on opportunities that accelerate the development of important underinvested functionalities, provide cross-selling opportunities, and rationalize costs through scale.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Industry,9.6.1,,"We view our business as having three distinct addressable markets, each of which is aligned with a specific business unit. While these markets are distinct in nature, there is a common thread in that the environment and underlying technology are deeply embedded and responsible for organizations’ most mission-critical functions. We expect the AMC Acquisition to further build out our product capabilities to address all customer use cases, and we will integrate the AMC business’s products into our existing business units. While investment in legacy systems has been stable, companies are increasing their spend across modernization, integration, hybridization and next-generation data applications. We are positioned to serve as a modernization partner that taps into growing budget pools focused on digital transformation across a suite of buyers with evergreen budget pools including the CIO, Chief Data Officer, Head of Applications and Head of Infrastructure. In aggregate, we view our current total addressable market as $24 billion, which sits within a broader $3.9 trillion digital transformation market. Our three current addressable markets are as follows: - _Mainframe and Hybrid Cloud Software: Our infrastructure modernization products support customers in optimizing their mainframe workloads across a broad spectrum of pathways. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to mainframe and hybrid cloud software to be approximately $11 billion. Going forward, this market is expected to grow at approximately 4% annually. We believe we have an approximately 4% market share of this addressable market. For most of our customers, the embedded nature of mainframe servers and the speed, size and security requirements of the workloads being run on them make switching away from the mainframe an expensive and difficult process. The importance of mainframe is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of the world’s production IT workloads are handled by mainframes. According to IBM, over $8 trillion in payments per year, and over 30 billion transactions per day, are processed by mainframes. Mainframe criticality is driven by the need for reliability, with many applications requiring high availability, and the complexity and vastness of the underlying code makes mainframe integral to operations. There are a range of advantages that mainframe offers over distributed computing including reliability, speed of computing and security. For customers who remain on the mainframe, the increased data requirements and volumes generated by the digitalization of businesses will lead to increasing mainframe workloads. For example, when retail bank account holders check their account or engage in online banking, this activity results in queries to the mainframe creating additional mainframe transaction volume. As retail banks and other institutions increase their product offerings and continue their digital transformation initiatives, the ability to connect and interact with the mainframe will be an important component of most IT deployments. Higher workload volume combined with the ongoing need to operate, optimize, and modernize the mainframe should provide continued growth opportunities within our Infrastructure Modernization business unit. ----- We expect the AMC Acquisition to expand our product offerings in the mainframe and hybrid cloud market with Enterprise Suite, COBOL and Mainframe ADLM, enabling further modernization of mainframe applications and hybrid cloud infrastructure. With the largest companies in the world across every major industry vertical continuing to leverage mainframe technology through hybrid cloud models, we expect that hybrid infrastructure will remain the architecture of choice. By enabling core IT infrastructure to continue living in mainframe environments while leveraging APIs that provide teams and customers with access to cloud solutions and web and mobile applications, businesses are providing a modern experience for employees and end-users, without taking on additional risk. - _Enterprise Content Management (“ECM”): Data modernization solutions enable organizations to capture, build, organize, manage and store enterprise documents and records. Using third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to ECM solutions to be approximately $5 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted to grow at approximately 6% annually. Enterprises need to securely manage documents and records across their organization and require software that provides tools to capture, build, organize, manage and store documents and records as they flow through business processes. ECM modernization tools for mainframe-based enterprises allow organizations to utilize terabytes of stored data that are typically inaccessible and unutilized. Common applications of ECM systems for our customers involve document generation workloads, which include invoice and statement generation and ticket issuance. More advanced processes include document ingestion, robotic process automation and workflow management. For example, processing a mortgage application is a complex process involving multiple steps and systems, which can be streamlined and automated with an ECM system. ECM solutions are often embedded in core customer facing workflows and are integrated with other core IT systems (enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, financial systems, etc.) that leverage other mainframe-stored content. The critical nature and deep integration of ECM workflows should continue to drive future growth within our Data Modernization business unit. - _App Development & Testing: Our application modernization solutions enable organizations to extract data from legacy Unix/Power Systems, modernize the experience for users and enable the usability of large scale non-relational databases. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to application development and testing to be approximately $8 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted to grow by approximately 5% annually. Organizations use application modernization products to improve application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for legacy applications in a safe and secure way. Common uses of application modernization products include enabling application development on top of mission-critical non-relational databases, removing complexity from building modern apps on legacy platforms with low- or no-code solutions and supporting agile DevOps methods across multiple legacy coding environments. Continued investment in functionality that supports cloud and containerized app deployments, organizations improving application UI/UX and a shift to low- or no-code development concepts should provide continued growth opportunities within our Application Modernization business unit. The AMC business’s Host Connectivity and CORBA segments offer complementary modernization solutions enabling Rocket to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and increase our share in the application and development testing market.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

We define our nonGAAP financial measures as follows: - Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue is revenue resulting from the annualized value of invoices for active maintenance and term/subscription contracts (including expired contracts that have a high probability of renewal within twelve months of the previously ended term) as of the last day of the reporting period, plus royalty, perpetual license, professional service and other revenue calculated on a last-twelve-month basis. Revenue is reported on a pro forma basis (including the historical financial performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition date for all periods presented) and excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue and backlog intangible asset amortization; ----- - Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue is cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology and employee stock compensation and other one-time expenses and including certain pro forma cost of revenue adjustments. - Non-GAAP Gross Profit is Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, which is GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation and other, and certain pro forma adjustments (including the historical financial performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition date for all periods presented); - EBITDA is net income (loss), excluding interest expense, other income (expense), employee stock compensation expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses; - Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, on a pro forma basis (including the historical financial performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition date for all periods presented), adjusted for Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue, and excluding costs or income relating to acquisitions, debt refinancing, management consulting, recruiting, employee termination and severance, restructuring, litigation, new product design and development, and other items that are considered non-core to business operations; - Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA is Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to give effect to restructuring activities and planned synergies related to certain acquisitions, including, as indicated, with and without, the AMC Acquisition; - Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin is Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA divided by Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue; - Free Cash Flow is Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA less capital expenditures, inclusive of financing lease payments; and - Free Cash Flow Conversion is Free Cash Flow divided by Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA. Certain of our Non-GAAP Metrics in this section have been calculated utilizing accounting principles not consistent with GAAP, including recognizing revenue on an ARR basis rather than in accordance with ASC 606. A primary difference between ARR and ASC 606 is the accounting for license revenue in our subscription or term license arrangements, which is annualized and recognized over the contract term under our ARR method, while recognized at a point in time, generally at the inception of the contract term, under ASC 606. Our Non-GAAP Metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), revenue or other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows or as measures of liquidity. We believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We believe that they provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures. We use these measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. Our use of the Non-GAAP metrics varies from others in our industry. Non-GAAP Metrics have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, the “Pro Forma” information presented herein under the “Pro Forma” column for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects certain adjustments as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” that were not applied to the “Pro Forma” information presented under the “Historical” columns for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, including Pro Forma Adjusted ----- EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin and certain other Non-GAAP Metrics. These metrics are therefore not fully comparable. Furthermore, the Non-GAAP Metrics that include the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not include the same pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as set forth in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and represent a management combined presentation whereby the Non-GAAP Metrics of the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 were added together with the Non-GAAP Metrics of Rocket for the same year, with certain adjustments as described below. The following table reconciles Net income (loss) to EBITDA to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA (excluding the AMC business for historical information) and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA (including the AMC business); Revenue to Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue to Non-GAAP Gross Profit; and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA (excluding the AMC business for historical information) to Free Cash Flow: Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue[(1)] .............................................. 476,062 504,045 Non-GAAP Gross Profit[(1)] ....................................................... 443,771 456,653 EBITDA[(1)] ................................................................................ 290,162 281,255 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA[(1)] ............................................... 307,545 281,926 Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA[(1)] ...................................... $ 285,061 $ 306,729 Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin[(1)] ......................... 60% 61% Free Cash Flow[(1)] ..................................................................... 284,541 305,852 Free Cash Flow Conversion[(1)] .................................................. 100% 100% (1) See footnote (1) under “––Rocket” above for definitions of the Non-GAAP Metrics and certain other information about our use of non-GAAP financial measures. The Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business were prepared by Rocket. Some of the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business were prepared by us based on certain financial information obtained through our financial diligence process. The methodology for preparing such financial information is different than the methodology used by OpenText to prepare the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business (including with respect to the allocation of shared costs) and such Non-GAAP Metrics should therefore not be viewed as substitutes for the AMC business’s results as reported under GAAP. OpenText neither prepared nor reviewed these Non-GAAP Metrics, and OpenText does not utilize any such Non-GAAP Metrics in its own reporting with respect to the AMC business. We have not yet closed the AMC Acquisition, and the NonGAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business are therefore subject to certain adjustments and changes after we close the AMC Acquisition and integrate the AMC business into our own business.

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the pro forma combined fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we generated approximately 38%, 35% and 23%, respectively, of our total Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue from this partnership. No other customer or partner accounted for more than 3% of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We are a party to a master licensed works agreement (the “MLWA”) with IBM to develop and update mission-critical software products for IBM’s core platforms. IBM is not obligated under the MLWA to issue new statements of work or work orders to us, nor is IBM required to spend a minimum amount with us in any period. As a result, there can be no assurance that the volume of work to be performed by us under the MLWA and the revenue we generate therefrom will not vary significantly from year to year, which could in turn cause our revenue to vary significantly from year to year and could potentially decrease in the future by material amounts. We may experience loss or reduction of business under the MLWA for any reason, including the royalties received for and quality of the products and services we provide. In addition, IBM has its own policies and guidelines that control its promotion and distribution practices and, pursuant to the terms of the MLWA, has the ability to change unilaterally how they promote and/or distribute the products we build for them. Accordingly, IBM may reduce prices to its end users, which would reduce the corresponding royalties to us. IBM may also demand increased quality standards or, under certain circumstances, transfer some or all of the work and services we currently provide in-house or to our current or future competitors. Alternatively, unexpected adverse events affecting the financial condition or business strategy of IBM could result in a reduction or delay in work orders from or a delay or default in payment by IBM. Our future growth will depend in part on IBM’s ability to market and sell our products and services and the loss of significant revenue under this partnership would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

However, these retention rates may decline or fluctuate in the future. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their maintenance contracts and subscriptions when existing terms expire. Our customers have no obligation to renew after the expiration of their contractual period and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew.

In addition, if competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our features, our ability to sell our features based on factors such as pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could negatively affect the growth of our revenue. Even if we do attract customers, the cost of new customer acquisition may prove so high as to prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability. Our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and value proposition of the systems and applications that our products support. Customers often view these commitments as significant strategic decisions and, as a result, may require time to evaluate, test and qualify our solutions prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us or acquiring new products from our portfolio. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. The failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a sales process could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the increased complexity and expansion of our customers’ IT infrastructures have driven additional usage of our installed solutions and provided opportunities to sell additional products from our portfolio and has caused us to invest in sales efforts focused on cross-selling and upselling existing customers.

The markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly, and the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as hybrid cloud, open source, mobile, workflow, consumer product-like user experiences, social, collaboration, machine learning, AI, internet connected devices, robotic automation, security, cryptography, development tools and other digital technologies increasingly become the basis for customer purchases. At the same time, our customers and prospective customers are facing their own competitive imperatives to adopt digital technologies, resulting in the ongoing disruption of almost every sector of the global economy. Accordingly, to compete effectively in our rapidly changing markets, we must: - identify and invest in the right emerging technologies and select them from the many technologies in which we could make investments; ----- - accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs; - successfully deliver new platform technologies and products that meet these business needs; - efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments; - profitably market and sell new products in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less experience; and - effectively deliver, either directly or through our ecosystem of partners, the business process planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be successful. Further, as new technologies (such as AI) continue to emerge, they may be disruptive to our industry as a whole. These technologies could result in new and innovative products and solutions that could increase competition, place us at a competitive disadvantage or even render our technology, products and solutions obsolete. As the adoption of AI quickens, we expect competition to intensify, and additional companies may enter our markets offering similar products, systems or solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors and our strategy to integrate AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems or solutions may also not be accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace. If we fail to meet any of these requirements or develop these technologies or our competitors or other third parties respond to such challenges more quickly or successfully than us, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions, new versions or enhancements of our solutions after commencement of commercial delivery. If new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support, our operating margins could be harmed. In addition, any disruptions, discovery of errors, risks related to our software solutions or other performance problems could significantly harm their and our reputations and businesses. With our current solutions strategy, these risks increase because we are combining already complex products to create solutions that are even more complicated than the aggregation of their product components. Significant technical challenges could also arise with our solutions, because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party software applications and databases. These combinations increase our risk, with respect to our customers, because, in the event of a systemwide failure, it may be difficult for the customer to determine which product is at fault; thus, we may be blamed for the failure of another supplier’s products. As a result of the foregoing, we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share, loss of customers, damage to our reputation, an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, higher development and testing and support costs, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and support resources, increased service and warranty costs, litigation and increased insurance costs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

In the course of our regular business operations, we process and transmit personal information, proprietary information, confidential information and other sensitive or regulated data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Computer programmers, hackers and other third parties may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate, copy or pirate the information and data we collect (including that of third parties), create system disruptions or cause interruptions or shutdowns of our internal systems and services. A number of websites have been subject to denial of service attacks, where a website is bombarded with information requests ----- eventually causing the website to overload, resulting in a delay or disruption of service. Also, in recent years, there has been a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach their security for malicious purposes. These attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. If successful, any of these events could damage our computer systems and equipment or those of our third-party hosting vendors or customers. Furthermore, these attacks could disrupt or prevent us from providing timely maintenance, support and services to our customers and result in the theft or misappropriation of proprietary, personally identifiable, confidential and other sensitive or regulated information and data of ours, our employees, our customers and our business partners and materially disrupt business for us, our customers and our business partners. Computer programmers, hackers and other third parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and may impede our sales and other critical functions. Security risks for us will also increase as we continue to grow our offerings and services, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data. Additionally, our customers may not effectively implement all of the updated security features that we introduce or make all necessary changes to their operating procedures, or they may fail to implement other required security measures. We have outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party vendors and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of these third parties’ own cyber security measures. Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in a safe and secure manner that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Due to our remote first work environment, there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related incidents as a result of our employees, service providers and other third parties working remotely on less secure systems and environments. Our efforts to protect our data, that of our customers or the information we receive from other third parties may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee, contractor or vendor error or malfeasance, government surveillance or other threats that evolve. Because the techniques used by such individuals or entities to access, disrupt or sabotage devices, systems and networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and we may not become aware in a timely manner of such a security breach, which could exacerbate any damage we experience. Affected users (including customers or third parties) or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosures of data, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. A successful cyber-attack could also negatively impact the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new customers. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business or financial results. Recent legislation has increased the responsibilities of software companies and their clients regarding financial security, identity theft and privacy. Subsequent changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could also impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products, services or features, or our ability to develop new products, services or features.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Additionally, these unexpected systems ----- outages or failures may require additional personnel and financial resources, disrupt our business or cause delays in the reporting of our financial results. We may also be required to modify, enhance, upgrade or implement new systems, procedures and controls to ensure the continuity of our business processes or to reflect changes in our business or technological advancements, which could cause us to incur additional costs and require additional management attention, placing burdens on our internal resources. Lack of data integrity could create inaccuracies and hinder our ability to perform meaningful business analysis and make informed business decisions. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable, or if we, or any of the thirdparty service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience operational disruptions that cause us to have disputes with or lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, experience regulatory sanctions, penalties or other legal problems, incur increased operating and administrative expenses, lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Delays in modifying, enhancing, upgrading or implementing our IT systems could limit the success or result in the failure of those initiatives and impair the effectiveness of our business processes and internal controls. We also outsource certain IT-related functions to third parties that are responsible for maintaining their own network security, disaster recovery and systems management procedures.

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.15,Our financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict and our business is affected by seasonality.,"Our revenues and profitability are affected by factors such as the introduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of our sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of our growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results. Our financial results may also be impacted by the structure of our products and services contracts and the nature of our customers’ businesses; for example, certain of our services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact our financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, our financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, we have experienced seasonality, in that we have had had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter by our customers, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The estimates and forecasts in this offering memorandum relating to the size and expected growth of the markets for our products and services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. Further, we may suffer as a result of inaccuracies in such determinations as they relate to potential acquisition targets or other strategic partners. For example, our expectations with respect to the synergies and growth possibilities following acquisitions may be significantly impacted if our estimates and assumptions are materially inaccurate. The principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include the size and expected growth rate of the global markets for our products, as well as a variety of adjacent enterprise and infrastructure software markets. Our market opportunity is also based on the assumption that the strategic approach that our software solutions enable for our potential customers will be more attractive to our customers than that offered by our competitors. ----- Historically, our investment in new products has expanded our market opportunity into areas of growing strategic importance, and we continue to introduce new products to increase our addressable market.

We believe we have a reputation for maintaining products for years, which leads to additional headcount and expense supporting older products that are not used by many existing customers or gaining new customers. We expect that, as we continue to improve and enhance our software solutions, this backward compatibility will no longer be practical or cost-effective, and we may decrease or discontinue service for our older products. To the extent we no longer provide extensive backward capability for our products, we may damage our relationship with our existing customers, which could decrease sales, generate legal claims and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to changes in operating and database systems, or any product quality and performance issues with the underlying databases or operating systems resulting in degradation of our products’ quality and performance, could influence customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality offered by competitors, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

While AI can present significant benefits, it can also present risks and challenges to our business. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into decisionmaking algorithms, security challenges and the protection of personal privacy could impair the adoption and acceptance of AI. If the output from AI in our products, systems or solutions are deemed to be inaccurate or questionable, or if the use of AI does not operate as anticipated or perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed. The integration of AI may also expose us to risks regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights, particularly if any copyrighted material is embedded in training models. The use of copyrighted materials in AI and other machine learning technology has not been fully interpreted by federal, state, or international courts and the regulatory framework for AI continues to evolve and remains uncertain. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the way in which AI and other machine learning technology is used in our products, systems or solutions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, including court decisions, could be significant.

These include: general economic and business conditions; the overall demand for software and services; governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and general political developments. Our single largest customer is a government entity, and our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations. Our contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government. ----- Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a government contract could adversely affect our revenue. Additionally, our government contracts are generally subject to certain requirements, some of which are generally not present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex. They may also be subject to audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Macroeconomic developments such as inflation and higher interest rate in the U.S. or elsewhere and potential economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or other countries could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their IT budgets or be unable to fund software and services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. We believe that bookings and revenues tied to new business and professional services could be particularly vulnerable in situations where we see customers broadly tightening IT budgets. In addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, including the war between Israel and Hamas, terrorist attacks around the globe and the war between Russia and the Ukraine and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Claims of patent and copyright infringement are common in the software industry. Third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim, with or without merit, could have a significant effect on our business and financial results. In addition, parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to market and license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property. Former employers of our employees may also assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Future litigation may also involve non-practicing entities or other intellectual property owners who have no relevant product offerings and against whom our own intellectual property may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Defending against any third-party claim could be time consuming, divert management’s attention from our business operations and result in adverse judgments, settlements on unfavorable terms or substantial litigation costs, including any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations that may result from such claims. As a result of such claims, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties or develop alternative technology or redesign our products. We cannot be sure that any such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

We rely, inter alia, on trademark, trade secret, copyright and patent protection, as well as a combination of non-disclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology, products and rights therein. However, these legal protections afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage. ----- In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the USPTO. Our issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may expire or may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing technologies related or similar to ours. Additionally, upon expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents. Finally, we may not have appropriately invested in growing our patent portfolio or in the right technologies. We also must rely on contractual provisions with the third parties that license technology to us and that obligate these third parties to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us. There is no guarantee that these third parties would be successful in attempting to protect our rights in any such licensed technology. There is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents or other intellectual property or any intellectual property or technology licensed to us. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and/or intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, partners and customers. However, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. In addition, we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. Although registration is not a requirement for trademark protection under U.S. law, obtaining a federal registration of a trademark provides significant advantages, for example with respect to the enforcement of trademark rights, as well as procedural advantages. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The unique risks of operating in a particular country may require us to adopt a different business approach or strategy in that particular country, which could increase our cost of doing business or limit the type of business activities we can perform in such country. In addition, if we suffer a business disruption due to any of the risks listed above and do not have in place or are not able to implement adequate response plans, our ability to support customers and maintain normal business operations for a significant length of time could be hindered such that our competitive position could be significantly impacted. Furthermore, our financial condition could be adversely impacted if our costs to recover escalate due to such recovery occurring over a protracted period. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding our international business, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Further, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. Due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the United States.

In order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, either the products of these acquired entities must be integrated with our existing products, the customers of these acquired entities must be integrated with our sales strategies, or both. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well-established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams. This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps.

Our contracts can contain a variety of terms, including license rights, service levels, security obligations, indemnification and regulatory requirements. Contract terms may not always be standardized across our customers and can be subject to differing interpretations, which could result in disputes with our customers from time to time. If our customers notify us of an alleged contract breach or otherwise dispute any provision under our contracts, the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect our results of operations. A portion of our revenue comes from identifying customers that are out of compliance with our license rights and enforcing such rights.

Compliance with such laws and regulations may require adhering to stringent legal and operational obligations and therefore the dedication of substantial time and financial resources which may increase over time. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may lead to fines, other enforcement action or reputational damage. For example, failure to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/ 679) (“GDPR”) or the UK implementation of the GDPR, could, in the worst case, attract regulatory penalties of up to the greater of: (i) €20 million or £17.5 million (as applicable); or (ii) 4% of the entire group’s annual worldwide turnover, as well as the possibility of enforcement actions (such as the suspension of processing activities and audits), and liabilities from third-party claims. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) went into effect on January 1, 2020, and generally applies to businesses that collect personal information about California consumers and meet certain thresholds with respect to revenue or buying and/or selling consumers’ personal information. If unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of a consumer’s personal information occurs, and the business did not maintain reasonable security practices, consumers could file a civil action (including a class action) without having to prove actual damages, including (i) statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater, and (ii) civil penalties imposed by the Attorney General ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per violation. Further, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”) to amend and extend the protections of the CCPA, likely leading to greater levels of enforcement and greater costs related to compliance with the CCPA and CPRA. The effects of these and other evolving data privacy laws may impose potential liabilities, operational and legal obligations, and require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliancerelated costs and expenses.

While we generally use commercially available or open source encryption components in some of our products, we still need to ensure that such products are not exported to embargoed countries or denied parties. Anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and generally prohibit companies and their directors, officers, employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. Such laws apply to our agents/third parties, and we leverage third parties, including channel partners, to distribute our products or to incorporate them into their own offerings. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of export controls, the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anticorruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, a significant diversion of management’s resources and attention or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breaches could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Many countries have recently introduced or enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. We carry out our business operations through entities in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. As such, we are required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax laws. Our U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax liabilities are determined, in part, by the amount of operating profit generated in these different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates as well as by the positioning of our cash balances globally. Similarly, if statutory tax rates or tax bases were to increase or if changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were made that impact us directly, our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. This evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence regarding sources of future taxable income. If management’s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets changes, we will be required to increase our valuation allowance, which will negatively impact our effective tax rate and earnings. We are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income taxes and result in additional tax expense and operating cash outflows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.","Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate the AMC business into our business. The integration of a business is a complex, costly and timeconsuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of the AMC business. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the acquired business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquisition premium or goodwill, could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities, and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the AMC business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers ----- and diversion of the attention of our management and employees. The challenges of integrating the operations of acquired businesses include, among others: - difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; - difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems; - difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures, business cultures, compensation structures and accounting and other policies; - difficulties in the acculturation of employees, which may be increased by our remote first work environment; - difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; - challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; - challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future success of the combined company; and - challenges in keeping key business relationships in place. OpenText will provide certain services to us following the consummation of the AMC Acquisition on a transitional basis to facilitate the integration of the AMC business pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement. We cannot assure you that all such functions will be successfully executed by OpenText during the transition period. We may be unable to replace such services in a timely manner or on comparable terms. An interruption to these services could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Following the AMC Acquisition, we will assume certain potential liabilities relating to the AMC business, including certain intellectual property matters, such as a matter filed by IBM in November 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging copyright infringement, as well as certain employee-related matters. As we integrate the AMC business into our operations, we may learn additional information about the AMC business, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. It is possible that these liabilities may exceed our expectations or that other liabilities, whether currently known or unknown to us, may result in substantial losses. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and divert the attention of technical and management personnel. These liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business to the extent we have not identified such liabilities or have underestimated the scope of such liabilities. For additional information, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings and diversion of management’s time and energy, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of our business and the AMC business are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the AMC Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities, or cash flows that are expected, and we will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the AMC business. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, other providers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition. These integration matters and our significant amount of indebtedness may hinder our ability to make further acquisitions and could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after consummation of the AMC Acquisition.

The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: - our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders may be impaired, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of our indebtedness; - our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, including costs associated with any international expansion, product and service development, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired; - our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired; - a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be used to repay the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; - we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns, increases in interest rates, adverse changes in industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations; - our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, the competitive landscape and the markets in which we operate may be limited; and - we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates. ----- Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control.

We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that could subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers form the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control.

Lower net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts, or higher provision for uncollectibles, generally will reduce our cash flow.

Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our variable rate debt began to rise significantly in 2022 and 2023, and these increases may continue, or such increased rates may not be decreased materially or at all, in 2024 and beyond. If interest rates continue to increase or remain high, our debt service ----- obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase or remain high even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, which will negatively impact our profitability and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness.

Additionally, higher interest rate will affect our ability to refinance portions of our indebtedness in advance of their maturity dates on terms that we deem attractive. In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and add stability to interest expense movements, we have historically entered into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of variable for fixed rate interest payments. However, certain of those interest rate swaps and caps have expired or will expire in the near term. New interest rate caps and the replacement of our expiring interest rate caps may be more expensive as a result of increasing interest rates. There can be no assurance that any such derivative financial instruments will have the desired beneficial impact or that we will be able to purchase additional interest rate caps or similar or other derivatives in the future on a cost-effective basis or at all. If we are unable to enter into such derivative financial instruments, or achieve favorable terms in such derivative financial instruments, in the future, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and, even if we use these instruments to selectively manage risks, there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against material interest rate fluctuations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

No appraisal of the value of such collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the notes, and the fair market value of the collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, inflation, higher interest rate, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the collateral securing the notes may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a firstpriority lien on such collateral will share the proceeds of such collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the collateral securing the notes and the remaining obligations under the notes and all of our other obligations secured by a _pari _passu lien on collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated_ indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceeded the value of the collateral securing the notes (after taking into account all other first-priority debt that was also secured by the collateral securing the notes, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. As a result, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to enable the holders of the notes to have an allowed claim for post-petition or post-filing interest, fees and expenses in an insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes and our other first-priority secured obligations exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.” With respect to some of the collateral securing the notes, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders may not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. ----- Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. All of the commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by the collateral securing the notes on a firstpriority lien basis and will be entitled to payment out of the proceeds of any sale of such collateral on a _pari passu basis with the holders of the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will also permit the Issuer and the Guarantors to create additional liens on the collateral securing the notes under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the notes.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such shared collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the applicable Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture or any other agreement governing first lien indebtedness subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if the authorized representative of the holders of such indebtedness represents the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on shared collateral and such authorized representative has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the Bank Collateral Agent has not commenced and is not then diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such shared collateral or any portion thereof or the Issuer or any Guarantor is not then a debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or liquidation proceeding. When the Bank Collateral Agent does not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the shared collateral, such right will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the shared collateral. If the Issuer issues additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral securing the notes. In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Bank Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral securing the notes resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations). The collateral so released will no longer secure the Issuer’s and the applicable Guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees. The holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from, among other things, objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to our use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection. Further, under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any shared collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations for distribution in accordance with the ----- provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any collateral securing the notes, proceeds or payments they may receive.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” If additional wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries or wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries organized under the laws of England or Wales are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such domestic guarantors (and, in respect of subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, filings with the applicable registries would be required). Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral under the indenture that will govern the notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Bank Collateral Agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) or, if applicable, the Side Car Collateral Agent will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired or arising in the future, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances.

Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and such guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the collateral securing the notes and such guarantees. In addition, it is not possible to conduct comprehensive lien searches in the jurisdiction in which the foreign Guarantors are organized. As a result, no assurance can be given that no liens exist securing significant obligations having priority on certain of the collateral, which liens may prevent or inhibit the Notes Collateral Agent from foreclosing on the liens securing the notes and may impair the value of the collateral that will secure the notes.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees and the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying, or defrauding other creditors, or (ii) the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or granting the liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees (or the related security interest with respect to the notes or the guarantees); ----- - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the granting of the related security interests with respect to the notes or the guarantees) left the Issuer or any of the Guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business or a transaction in which the Issuer or such Guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or the granting of liens was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee (and any related liens) in total or in part or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the Guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. Also, for this analysis, “debts” includes contingent and unliquidated debts. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee (or related liens) if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable Guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court voids any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable Guarantor. If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable Guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable Guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee of the notes. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining Guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor. Even if the guarantee of a Guarantor is not voided as a fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to that Guarantor’s other debt, and in that event, the guarantees would be subordinated (including structurally) to all of that Guarantor’s other debt. ----- Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a Guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such Guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period (or within 90 days for any non-insider party) prior to a bankruptcy filing and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the Guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Any future pledge of collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any liens delivered or reinstated and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor-in-possession) or guarantor (as a debtor-in-possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the guarantee or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any pledge of collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the issue date of the notes had been pledged or perfected or issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to the Notes,13.3.20,Rights of holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.,"The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the notes and the applicable guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuer or the Guarantors or the related guarantees prior to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy ----- case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral securing the notes, the value of such collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings or at any time thereafter, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of such collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, any disposition of the collateral securing the notes during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require prior approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral securing the notes is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations, as defined in “Description of Notes,” the holders of the notes would be considered “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a creditor holding “undersecured” claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. In addition, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral securing the notes or to our use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

The insolvency laws of England & Wales may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Although laws differ amongst these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the guarantees and the collateral, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the guarantee against a Guarantor. A court may also in certain circumstances void the guarantee or the collateral where a Guarantor or security provider is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency.

Holders of the notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes (and all of our other first-priority obligations) exceed the fair market value of the collateral. Accordingly, in any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have guaranteed the notes, it is possible that the ----- bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of the collateral securing the notes. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes. As a result, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to enable the holders of the notes to have an allowed claim for post-petition or post-filing interest, fees, and expenses in an insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Under ASC 805, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized and measured at their assumed acquisition date fair value, while transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill.

The base purchase price for the AMC Acquisition is a cash payment of $2.275 billion (the “Purchase Consideration”), subject to customary net working capital adjustments and indebtedness as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement (collectively, the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Consideration is to be funded from cash on hand and additional debt equity commitments (as defined herein) (collectively, for purpose of this section, the “Financing Transactions”). See _Note 2, Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_ to Rocket’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further information. The AMC Acquisition is expected to close substantially concurrently with or promptly after the closing of this offering of the notes. The AMC Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method with Rocket as the accounting acquirer in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Under this method of accounting, the total consideration will be allocated to the AMC business’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, with limited exception for acquired deferred revenue balance, as of the closing date of the AMC Acquisition. The process of valuing the net assets of the AMC business at the expected closing date of the AMC Acquisition, as well as evaluating accounting policies for conformity, is preliminary. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the purchase price allocation reflected in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is preliminary and subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value and final adjustments to the Purchase Price. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the preliminary information available and management’s preliminary valuation of the fair value of intangible and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Certain assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the working capital adjustments, will be valued as part of the final purchase accounting assessment and have not been fully considered in the preliminary valuation. Accordingly, the actual purchase accounting assessment may vary based on final analyses of the valuation of assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed, particularly in regard to definite-lived intangible assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.

Intangible assets consist of technology, customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames, and backlog. Other long-lived assets generally consist of property and equipment. The Company’s intangible assets, other than backlog and those intangible assets classified as indefinite-lived, as well as the Company’s property and equipment, are depreciated or amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives, or lease term, on a pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets that are amortized to expense have estimated useful lives that range from eight to twenty-one years. Backlog is amortized, as a reduction of revenue, on a specific identification basis following the recognition of the revenue of the underlying contracts. Amortization of intangible assets charged to cost of revenue and operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $207.0 million and $206.9 million, respectively. Backlog amortization expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was $6.2 million and $9.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to the Company, and trends in the fair value of the Company’s common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact. ----- The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company, whose management uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it has one reporting unit. The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 on the single reporting unit and concluded that goodwill had not been impaired. Similar to the evaluation of those long-lived assets that are not amortized, the Company evaluates amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets, if any, are less than the carrying value of the assets. If an asset or asset group is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss, if any, represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Each period, the Company also evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its long-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. A considerable amount of judgment is required in performing an impairment analysis, principally in determining discount rates, and financial forecasts. Unanticipated changes in market conditions could have a material impact on the Company’s projected cash flows. Differences in actual cash flows as compared to the projected cash flows, as well as changes in market conditions, could require the Company to record additional impairment losses in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Subsequently, the Company recognizes revenue through the application of the following steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s policy does not permit a right of return. _Non-OEM Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Accounts Receivable, and Deferred Revenue_ The Company’s software licenses are primarily on-premise and fully functional when made available to the customer. As the customer can use and benefit from the license on its own, on-premise software licenses represent distinct performance obligations. Revenue for software licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when a license key is delivered to a customer, and the customer may use and benefit from the license. These licenses are sold as perpetual or for a fixed term. Perpetual licenses are generally invoiced upon execution of the contract. Term licenses are generally invoiced upfront or on an annual basis over the term of the arrangement, which generally range from one to five years. Any difference between the license revenue recognized and the amount invoiced to the customer is accounted for on the consolidated balance sheets as unbilled accounts receivable. The Company’s maintenance service consists of technical support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available unspecified software upgrades. As these maintenance services are considered to be a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress, the Company concludes that they represent one combined performance obligation. Maintenance revenue is therefore recognized ratably over the contract period. Any difference between the maintenance amount invoiced or collected and the maintenance revenue recognized is accounted for on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Professional services primarily include consulting and training services. In general, services are distinct performance obligations. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are delivered to the customer. The Company ----- applies the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing for time and materials-based arrangements as the invoiced amount corresponds to the value of the services provided. The Company also sells several SaaS hosted offerings. These SaaS offerings are sold via a subscription-based model. Customers can use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of it and the services are available to them throughout the entire term, even if they do not use the service. As the services related to this model are indistinct from one another and have the same duration and measure of progress, revenue related to these offerings is recognized ratably over the contract period. SaaS arrangements are generally invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the arrangement. As part of the review over the transaction price, the Company considers whether there are any variable fees, such as usage-based arrangements, or price concessions that may give rise to variable consideration. Revenue related to variable consideration is recorded at the time of the transfer of licenses or services to its customers. Significant judgment is required in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company utilizes observable inputs when they exist, such as for maintenance renewals on historical perpetual license sales, and for SaaS hosted arrangements. The standalone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically the standalone selling prices for software licenses, are highly variable. In these instances, the Company estimates a narrow range of standalone selling prices using observable pricing information, such as the Company’s existing price list and historical sales data. When bundled term license and maintenance sales occur, the Company bifurcates the transaction into its two separate performance obligations, and then allocates the transaction value accordingly. The Company’s allocation between the term license and maintenance performance obligations is calculated based upon the observable relationship of the selling price of a standalone maintenance renewal to the related perpetual license fee, which is generally 20% of the net license fee for one year of maintenance. The Company considers using the observable relationship between a perpetual license fee and a standalone maintenance renewal to be appropriate for allocating value within a bundled arrangement because the nature of the respective performance obligations and the rights transferred to the customer are similar. As part of the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations, the Company considers the presence of any material rights or specified future upgrades that could represent additional performance obligations. The Company did not identify any material right performance obligations in the periods presented. _OEM Revenue Recognition_ Consistent with ASC 606, the Company recognizes royalty revenue to which it is entitled in the period in which it is earned. The Company utilizes customer information and other sources of information to determine the most likely estimate of royalty revenue to be recognized and accrued each period. As a management estimate, the determination of sales based royalty revenue requires significant judgment. In the event of any material difference between the estimate and the actual royalty received, the Company will record an adjustment in the period the revenue was earned.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

International sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect revenue results. However, as most of the Company’s revenue comes from North American entities that operate in U.S. dollars, this is not deemed to be a significant risk. The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. These customers operate based upon allocated budgets and appropriations. In the event that a government or agency enters into a multi-year contract and does not receive its expected allocated budget, it is possible that the existing contract could be terminated. However, the Company’s standard practice is for any multi-year contract to contain a substantive termination penalty, which provides evidence of enforceable rights and obligations throughout the stated contract term. Therefore, this is not seen to be a significant risk to revenue recognition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Valuation allowances are calculated for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on currently available evidence, may not be realized. For uncertain tax positions, the Company records a liability associated with an uncertain tax position if the Company determines that there is not a more likely than not possibility of sustaining such benefit upon audit by the taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position.

This occurs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to funding the project, and it is feasible that the project will be completed, and the software will perform the intended function. The Company ceases to capitalize costs related to a software project when it enters the post-implementation and operation stage. If different determinations are made with respect to the state of development of a software project, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially. Costs capitalized during the application development stage consist of payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time directly to, a project to develop software for internal use. The Company also capitalizes the direct costs of materials and services, which generally includes outside contractors, and interest. The Company does not capitalize any general and administrative or overhead costs or costs incurred during the application development stage related to training or data conversion costs. Costs related to upgrades and enhancements to internal-use software, if those upgrades and enhancements result in additional functionality, are capitalized. If upgrades and enhancements do not result in additional functionality, those costs are expensed as incurred. If different determinations are made with respect to whether upgrades or enhancements to software projects would result in ----- additional functionality, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially. The Company amortizes capitalized costs with respect to development projects for internal-use software when the software is ready for use. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a 3-year period. In determining and reassessing the estimated useful life over which the cost incurred for the software should be amortized, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 capitalized software development costs were $7.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Additions, relating to capitalized software development costs, incurred during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Operating leases with a duration of 12 months or less are excluded from ROU assets and operating lease liabilities and related expenses are recorded as incurred. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The lease ROU asset includes any initial direct costs incurred and is reduced for tenant incentives. As the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company performs a synthetic credit rating analysis and uses publicly available credit ratings for peer companies based upon the determined synthetic credit rating analysis. The Company estimates the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the ROU assets for possible impairment in accordance with the longlived assets policy above. Lease expense for minimum lease payments for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company cannot be assured that it will not experience losses on these deposits. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to variable-rate debt it has issued or borrowed, including debt under the Existing First Lien Term Loans and the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. The Company issues long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. The Company may use interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to obtain a fixed interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of floating for fixed interest payments. However, the Company may choose not to swap floating for fixed interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if the Company believes a larger proportion of variable-rate debt would be beneficial.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

To determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, the AMC business has the option to perform a qualitative assessment. However, the AMC business may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. The process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires the AMC business to make estimates that may significantly impact the outcome of the analysis. Under the qualitative assessment, the AMC business considers several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit and the excess of fair value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the recent and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, cost factors, as well as other factors. The AMC business has concluded that there is one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. On December 31, 2023, and 2022, the AMC business performed its qualitative impairment test for goodwill which indicated that the fair value for the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, and therefore did not result in a goodwill impairment.

Foreign jurisdictions in which the AMC business operates have different statutory tax rates. The AMC business did not operate as a standalone entity in the past and, accordingly, tax losses, receivables and other deferred tax assets included in the audited combined carveout financial statements on a separate return basis may not be available upon separation of the AMC business from Parent. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases between financial reporting and income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. AMC records valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Separately, tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The AMC business’s effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences, certain one-time items and changes in tax contingencies.

For each of the periods indicated below, the AMC business presents revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue. The comparability of the AMC business’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the addition of OT Connectivity to the AMC business on February 1, 2023. Total revenues increased by $59.3 million across all product types in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to revenue contributions from the addition of OT Connectivity and growth in license revenue of $7.9 million with related customer support revenue and professional service revenue increases of $7.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The addition of OT Connectivity contributed $37.9 million to total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $26.6 million related to customer support revenues and $11.3 million related to license revenues. Total cost of revenues increased by $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year ended December 31, 2022, which is comprised of an increase in the AMC business’s direct costs of $11.6 million, allocated shared corporate costs of $3.8 million, and additional direct costs of $1.2 million as a result of the MF Acquisition and addition of that business. Of the total $16.6 million increase, $15.7 million was driven by labor-related and consulting costs. The increase in labor-related costs were caused by a reorganization of the go-to-market operations of Micro Focus during the second half of 2022, which resulted in an increase in the dedicated AMC business customer support headcount, an investment in increasing the professional service consultants in the AMC business, and the MF Acquisition and addition of that business. The consulting costs increase was driven by an increase in outsourcing costs following a transition from internal to outsourced support for first line customer support implemented in the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 as well as increased use of contracting resources to support professional service projects during 2023. Total operating expenses increased by $60.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year ended December 31, 2022, which is comprised of additional research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative allocated shared corporate costs of $29.0 million, the AMC business’s direct expenses of $26.0 million and $5.7 million of direct costs associated with the addition of OT Connectivity.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

These agreements allow customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods.

The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer.

We enable small and large enterprises in many industries to maximize their data, systems and infrastructure to deliver critical services that power our modern world. Our software runs, optimizes and protects our customers’ applications, servers and databases, and integrates these core platforms with the rest of the enterprise, while providing a full-stack of modernization solutions. Our products enable customers to carry out their most mission-critical business functions, such as processing payment transactions at global financial institutions and maintaining healthcare records at hospitals and insurance companies. Since our founding over 30 years ago, we have cultivated a customer-centric culture with strategic investments in R&D that provide a wide range of solutions to meet customers’ evolving needs. We have evolved from solely maintaining legacy infrastructure to facilitating modernization journeys to connect mainframe to the hybrid cloud environment. We have accomplished this evolution through substantial R&D efforts, highlighted by over $500 million in investments into R&D since 2020, as well as multiple acquisitions that have expanded our modernization offering. Given our focus on supporting our customers’ mission-critical business functions, our products address deeply embedded technologies that sit at the core of enterprise IT infrastructure. These systems have evolved over multiple decades and, particularly for our largest customers, represent billions of dollars of cumulative custom application development and IT infrastructure investment. As enterprises look to the future, hybrid remains vital to enabling the deployment of cloud environments as it incorporates client server computing, cloud-based platforms, and modern connectivity and portability. We seek to enable our customers to experience the best of both the cloud and the mainframe, putting relevant workloads in the cloud while leveraging the mainframe for its best features – security, reliability, and governance. Our strategy is to modernize without disruption, meeting customers where they are in their modernization journey. By utilizing our product portfolio, customers can modernize effectively, even incrementally, integrating new technologies while preserving and leveraging the robust foundation already in place for a seamless technological evolution. We believe this approach dramatically lowers risk and improves success rates of IT system modernization projects. As the pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, we believe our customers will increasingly look to us to extract greater value from existing IT systems and applications through innovation, integration, optimization and modernization. Today, Rocket is organized into three main business units focused on Infrastructure Modernization, Data Modernization and Application Modernization. While each business unit has its own technical requirements and products, we go to market using a holistic approach to solving our customers’ problems, utilizing solutions across our business units to help drive operating efficiencies among overlapping buying centers to best position us to drive future growth. These business units are as follows: _Infrastructure Modernization: Our Infrastructure Modernization business unit represents approximately_ 55% of our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It comprises software solutions built for integrating and optimizing mainframe workloads, mitigating security and compliance risks and optimizing storage. Organizations can leverage our range of solutions to support mainframe security and compliance in the face of new threats and deliver optimized mainframe performance management and interoperability. The mainframe continues to be an integral part of modern-day IT infrastructure and provides a reliable architecture for high-volume data processing and transactions. Mainframes provide a level of five 9s of availability (99.999%), which is several orders of magnitude higher than alternative distributed servers, making mainframes the optimal platform for mission-critical processes. Additionally, mainframes are uniquely engineered to process millions of input and output calculations per second, which is a key difference from distributed servers that are designed to be more general purpose, limiting their ability to perform a specialized task extremely well. Consequently, mainframes provide a range of advantages over distributed systems that are likely to persist, and we believe organizations in regulated and ----- data intensive industries will continue to rely on mainframe systems to process high-volume, missioncritical activity at the core of their IT infrastructures. _Data Modernization: Our Data Modernization business unit represents approximately 18% of our_ standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It provides software solutions to connect mission-critical data residing on the mainframe and distributed systems to advanced applications and compute workloads running on private and public cloud environments. As organizations increasingly adopt a hybrid cloud infrastructure approach to operations, effectively navigating the complexities of data governance and compliance while maximizing data utilization is critical. Our solutions address this challenge by eliminating data siloes to enhance decision-making and customer experience while maintaining strong data governance, security, scalability and dynamic availability. For example, one of our key products, Mobius, enables customers to integrate seamlessly with third-party repositories, facilitating secure and efficient data movement between modern and legacy systems. Our track record of successfully integrating acquisitions within this business unit highlights our commitment to providing an end-to-end offering that reframes customer engagement strategies and paves the way for future growth. _Application Modernization: Our Application Modernization business unit represents the remaining 27% of_ our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It is comprised of a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for legacy applications. While Application Modernization covers both distributed offmainframe platforms and mainframe environments, many of the most important back-end applications for large enterprises still reside on the mainframe and have yet to be modernized. With key offerings including database management, DevOps, and low-code application development platforms, we enable organizations to efficiently deliver reliable, scalable and secure applications to support their core business needs. One of our key innovations has been to enable enterprise adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern development practices even for legacy systems. Across these three business units, we serve over 12,500 end-user customers, pro forma for the AMC Acquisition. Our customer base spans every major industry vertical and includes some of the largest companies in the world, including 43 of the Fortune 50, as of 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). Our customer base is highly diversified with the top ten Rocket-led customers representing just 14% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). In addition to these deeply embedded and long-term customer relationships, we have also cultivated a number of partnerships that are critical to our business. Our largest partnership is with IBM. We generate approximately 23% of our revenue through IBM-led sales. Through a series of organic R&D investments, acquisitions, joint development efforts and a strong GTM partnership, we have become one of IBM’s most trusted software partners. This partnership has evolved over 30 years and is driven primarily by our expertise in mainframe and mid-range servers of which IBM is a major manufacturer. Our software enhances and creates efficiencies for IBM’s customers and extends the life of IBM’s core platforms. In partnership with IBM, we develop and support core software offerings in their portfolio, freeing IBM to redirect their R&D spend to other areas. As part of our partnership with IBM, numerous Rocket products are re-branded as IBM products and sold through their global salesforce. While we are committed to remaining a high-quality business partner to IBM and extending the lifetime value of core IBM-led products, we are working to increase the share of Rocket-led sales to further diversify our revenue. Our Rocket-led GTM strategy, whether executed directly or through our channel partners, allows us to provide best-inclass support to our customers in managing their mainframe and modernization journey, particularly as they move towards a hybrid cloud environment. We are headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and maintain a large global footprint with significant operations in North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. As of December 31, 2023 we had 2,200 employees (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition) worldwide with a presence in 13 global offices. Following the AMC Acquisition, we expect to have approximately 3,000 Rocketeers and 20 global offices. This worldwide coverage provides us with access to economies of scale, lower cost offshore operations, high-growth emerging markets and global support for our increasingly global customer base. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3206,AMC BUSINESS’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,3206.36,Acquisition of Application Modernization and Connectivity,3206.36.1,,"On November 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the AMC business of OpenText, which includes historically a product group of Micro Focus and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OT Connectivity business, a product group of OpenText, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments.

The revenue derived from Enterprise Server is highly recurring in nature and allows for an emulated mainframe on cloud environments with the ability to run mission-critical applications. _COBOL: The AMC business’s COBOL business unit represents approximately 36% of its revenue for the_ year ended December 31, 2023. This solution enables organizations to develop, maintain and deploy COBOL based applications across the enterprise using modern DevOps tools and platforms. COBOL is a legacy programming language that is integral to the majority of mission-critical applications. As most developers lack experience working in COBOL, a modern set of DevOps tools enables enterprises to modernize and update their most important applications. The AMC business’s tools provide an IDE for analyzing and editing COBOL in applications primarily off-mainframe, providing developers with visualizations and coding environments similar to modern IDEs. As one indicator of the AMC business’s market position, the AMC business is the only official COBOL compiler available on CSPs marketplaces. _Host Connectivity: The AMC business’s Host Connectivity business unit represents approximately 32% of_ its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution includes mainframe terminal emulators and plugins for application access, process automation and security solutions. Customer use cases include providing flexible access to mission-critical applications running on mainframe environments via modern, distributed systems (desktop, web and mobile) in a secure and compliant manner (i.e. multi factor authentication). The AMC business’s Host Connectivity tools provide a broad number of options that allow for significant customization to deliver strong, auditable and compliant security that meets organizations’ requirements. _Mainframe Application Development Life Cycle Management: The AMC business’s Mainframe ADLM_ business unit represents approximately 11% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides mainframe source code change, configuration and management enabling organizations to modernize and integrate mainframes across new technologies and platforms. This results in shorter app delivery cycles, stronger security and increased productivity. Customer use cases include version control functionality to track changes made to source code (i.e. ChangeMan ZMF), change management workflow, release management and automation, automated testing, auditing and reporting. ----- _CORBA: The AMC business’s COBRA business unit represents approximately 3% of its revenue for the_ year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides middleware for communication across distributed applications. CORBA add-on solutions enable any CORBA application to take advantage of new deployment models, including cloud, containers and virtual environments or to extend and re-use existing CORBA resources without prior knowledge of CORBA technology. These solutions are used in telecommunications for managing network elements and the integration of different vendor equipment, in military and defense for building command and control systems and in finance for trading and risk management systems. The AMC Acquisition represents a highly complementary addition to our product portfolio, with the AMC business expected to further build out a more diverse modernization portfolio that aligns with customer demands and allows us to meet our customers wherever they are on their modernization journey. The AMC Acquisition is expected to achieve key strategic objectives, including: - Expanding the product portfolio with a stronger, more comprehensive modernization offering that is able to meet customers at any stage of their IT modernization journey, whether modernizing in place, migrating select workloads to hybrid environments or replatforming; - Providing a full-stack of products and solutions to enable end-to-end modernization without the disruption of existing workflows and allow customers to derive value from their decades of investment in core applications; - Expanding customer reach through deeper and broader customer engagement across Fortune 2000 accounts for greater retention and cross-selling.

This multi-layered approach opens corporate budgets beyond the mainframe and infrastructure-centric buyer and expands our wallet share to larger digital transformation initiatives that we can access through upsell and cross-sell opportunities. _Maintain Our Strong Operational Efficiency and Profitability_ Our focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management has helped us to maintain consistently high Adjusted EBITDA margins. This commitment to cost control has enabled our ongoing investments in R&D to further expand our solution footprint. We believe this continued emphasis on cost control results in attractive operating leverage and cash flow generation. ----- _Pursue Accretive Acquisitions to Further Supplement Our Portfolio_ Over our history, we have completed more than 50 acquisitions and developed a track record of successfully integrating acquired companies. Acquisitions have historically been completed at attractive multiples and have allowed us to further enhance our product portfolio. Our multi-prong approach to evaluating potential acquisitions includes identification of (1) Solution Enhancement, (2) Solution Expansion and (3) Synergy Realization, which allows us to be intentional and methodical throughout both the discovery and vetting processes. We focus on opportunities that accelerate the development of important underinvested functionalities, provide cross-selling opportunities, and rationalize costs through scale.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376
1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,3206,AMC BUSINESS’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,3206.47,Our Industry,3206.47.1,,"We view our business as having three distinct addressable markets, each of which is aligned with a specific business unit. While these markets are distinct in nature, there is a common thread in that the environment and underlying technology are deeply embedded and responsible for organizations’ most mission-critical functions. We expect the AMC Acquisition to further build out our product capabilities to address all customer use cases, and we will integrate the AMC business’s products into our existing business units. While investment in legacy systems has been stable, companies are increasing their spend across modernization, integration, hybridization and next-generation data applications. We are positioned to serve as a modernization partner that taps into growing budget pools focused on digital transformation across a suite of buyers with evergreen budget pools including the CIO, Chief Data Officer, Head of Applications and Head of Infrastructure. In aggregate, we view our current total addressable market as $24 billion, which sits within a broader $3.9 trillion digital transformation market. Our three current addressable markets are as follows: - _Mainframe and Hybrid Cloud Software: Our infrastructure modernization products support customers in optimizing their mainframe workloads across a broad spectrum of pathways. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to mainframe and hybrid cloud software to be approximately $11 billion. Going forward, this market is expected to grow at approximately 4% annually. We believe we have an approximately 4% market share of this addressable market. For most of our customers, the embedded nature of mainframe servers and the speed, size and security requirements of the workloads being run on them make switching away from the mainframe an expensive and difficult process. The importance of mainframe is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of the world’s production IT workloads are handled by mainframes. According to IBM, over $8 trillion in payments per year, and over 30 billion transactions per day, are processed by mainframes. Mainframe criticality is driven by the need for reliability, with many applications requiring high availability, and the complexity and vastness of the underlying code makes mainframe integral to operations. There are a range of advantages that mainframe offers over distributed computing including reliability, speed of computing and security. For customers who remain on the mainframe, the increased data requirements and volumes generated by the digitalization of businesses will lead to increasing mainframe workloads. For example, when retail bank account holders check their account or engage in online banking, this activity results in queries to the mainframe creating additional mainframe transaction volume. As retail banks and other institutions increase their product offerings and continue their digital transformation initiatives, the ability to connect and interact with the mainframe will be an important component of most IT deployments. Higher workload volume combined with the ongoing need to operate, optimize, and modernize the mainframe should provide continued growth opportunities within our Infrastructure Modernization business unit. We expect the AMC Acquisition to expand our product offerings in the mainframe and hybrid cloud market with Enterprise Suite, COBOL and Mainframe ADLM, enabling further modernization of mainframe applications and hybrid cloud infrastructure. With the largest companies in the world across every major industry vertical continuing to leverage mainframe technology through hybrid cloud models, we expect that hybrid infrastructure will remain the architecture of choice. By enabling core IT infrastructure to continue living in mainframe environments while leveraging APIs that provide teams and customers with access to cloud solutions and web and mobile applications, businesses are providing a modern experience for employees and end-users, without taking on additional risk. ----- - _Enterprise Content Management: Data modernization solutions enable organizations to capture, build, organize, manage and store enterprise documents and records. Using third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to ECM solutions to be approximately $5 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted to grow at approximately 6% annually. Enterprises need to securely manage documents and records across their organization and require software that provides tools to capture, build, organize, manage and store documents and records as they flow through business processes. ECM modernization tools for mainframe-based enterprises allow organizations to utilize terabytes of stored data that are typically inaccessible and unutilized. Common applications of ECM systems for our customers involve document generation workloads, which include invoice and statement generation and ticket issuance. More advanced processes include document ingestion, robotic process automation and workflow management. For example, processing a mortgage application is a complex process involving multiple steps and systems, which can be streamlined and automated with an ECM system. ECM solutions are often embedded in core customer facing workflows and are integrated with other core IT systems (enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, financial systems, etc.) that leverage other mainframe-stored content. The critical nature and deep integration of ECM workflows should continue to drive future growth within our Data Modernization business unit. - _App Development & Testing: Our application modernization solutions enable organizations to extract data from legacy Unix/Power Systems, modernize the experience for users and enable the usability of large scale non-relational databases. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to application development and testing to be approximately $8 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted to grow by approximately 5% annually. Organizations use application modernization products to improve application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for legacy applications in a safe and secure way. Common uses of application modernization products include enabling application development on top of mission-critical non-relational databases, removing complexity from building modern apps on legacy platforms with low- or no-code solutions and supporting agile DevOps methods across multiple legacy coding environments. Continued investment in functionality that supports cloud and containerized app deployments, organizations improving application UI/UX and a shift to low- or no-code development concepts should provide continued growth opportunities within our Application Modernization business unit. The AMC business’s Host Connectivity and CORBA segments offer complementary modernization solutions enabling Rocket to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and increase our share in the application and development testing market.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

On or around the date of issuance of the notes offered hereby, we intend to enter into the Euro Incremental Term Loan Facility under the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans and the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility, either as a side car term loan facility or as an incremental term loan facility under the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans, in a combined aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million (reflecting U.S. dollar-equivalent for the Euro Incremental Term Loan Facility), in each case with a syndicate of lenders, that will rank pari passu with the Existing First Lien Term Loans and which will mature on November 28, 2028. The documentation for our Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides that we have the right at any time, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (1) $175 million and (2) an amount equal to 65% of our trailing twelve-month consolidated EBITDA at the time of determination on a pro forma basis, plus (b) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments (including open market purchases) of the Existing First Lien Term Loans and certain other debt (to the extent not funded with the proceeds of long-term debt other than revolving loans), plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of any first lien refinancing facilities or certain other refinancing debt, plus (d) an additional amount so long as we (I) in the case of incremental debt that is secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro forma first lien net leverage ratio, (II) in the case of incremental debt that is secured by a lien on the collateral junior to the liens securing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro forma secured net leverage ratio and (III) in the case of unsecured incremental debt or incremental debt secured solely by assets not constituting collateral, do not exceed a specified pro forma total net leverage ratio. The interest rate for the Existing Dollar Term Loan is or will be, as applicable, at the Company’s election: (i) 3.75%, plus “ABR” defined as the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime lending rate in effect on such day, and (c) Term SOFR applicable for an interest period of one month commencing on such day plus 1.0%; or (ii) 4.75% plus Term SOFR, which is subject to a 0.50% Term SOFR floor and Term SOFR adjustment. The interest rate for the Existing Euro Term Loan is: (i) 4.75%, plus “Adjusted EURIBOR Rate,” which is subject to a 0.00% floor. Interest payments are due either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans and Adjusted EURIBOR Rate Loans, no less frequently than quarterly. Principal payments of 1% per ----- annum of the initial Existing First Lien Term Loans amounts are payable quarterly, with the remaining balance due at the maturity date for the Existing First Lien Term Loans on November 28, 2028. The interest rate for the Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities is expected to be Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin. The Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility interest rate is, at the Company’s election, (i) 2.25% plus ABR, or (ii) 3.25% plus SOFR with margin step-downs dependent on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio as follows: (a) if the first lien net leverage ratio is between 4.50 to 1.00 and 4.00 to 1.00 the ABR and SOFR margins are 2.125% and 3.125%, respectively; and (b) if the first lien net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 the ABR and SOFR margins are 2.00% and 3.00%, respectively. The maturity date of the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is November 28, 2026. The Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility’s capacity is reduced by the aggregated letters of credit outstanding, which totaled $1.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant that applies solely with respect to the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility and requires a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 7.70 to 1.00 if, on the last day of any quarter, the principal amount of revolving credit loans then outstanding under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 35% of the aggregate outstanding revolving credit commitments. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are also subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements, including, with respect to the Existing First Lien Term Loans, 50% (with step-downs to 25% and 0% based on achieving certain first lien net leverage ratios) of annual excess cash flow greater than $15 million in any fiscal year. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain quarterly and annual financial reporting requirements.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero. The Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of the Notes; provided, however that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate at such time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the Escrow Release Date.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person authorized by it) may act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent for the Series of First Lien Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative. With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct any Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to ----- take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Document, applicable law or otherwise. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 180-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable Additional First Lien Obligations under which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its Additional First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such NonControlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; _provided, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur_ and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (A) at any time the administrative agent under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to Shared Collateral or a material portion thereof or (B) at any time any the Company or any Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will have any rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties; (iii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral; and (iv) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured Party may vote on any plan of reorganization, plan of liquidation, agreement for composition, or other type of plan of arrangement proposed in or in connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative if it is not the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No NonControlling Collateral Agent, Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in respect of any Shared Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so.

If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any ----- Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of any bankruptcy law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute or assert in any suit, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral and none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent, such Applicable Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if not the Controlling Collateral Agent, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale, transfer or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided, that (i) the Liens in favor of each Collateral Agent for the benefit of each related Series of First Lien Secured Parties secured by such Shared Collateral attach to any such proceeds of such sale or disposition with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties as existed prior to the commencement of such sale or other disposition, and any such Liens shall remain subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement until application thereof pursuant to the waterfall provisions above and (ii) any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be allocated and applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above. _Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_ The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that it shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to a case or proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law, each Authorized Representative (other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent shall then oppose or object (or join in or support any objection) to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared ----- Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral for such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration for Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to or oppose (or support any other Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.7,Security for the Notes,124.7.8,Sufficiency of Collateral,"The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first-priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether ----- or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all of the obligations secured by the collateral on a pari passu or senior basis. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a _pari passu or senior basis), the First Lien Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the_ value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Credit Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future ----- Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. The Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Company of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Company exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Company’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge ----- Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable ----- U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) or the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $137.5 million and 17.5% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. ----- The Credit Agreements may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

In addition, to the extent not otherwise satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the Company’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call will be following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10 Business Days from the time that the Company distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No fewer than two days prior to the conference call, the Company will issue a press release or otherwise announce the time and date of such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective investors and market making financial institutions to obtain access to such call.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; _provided_ that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information, if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports delivered to it. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

or (9) the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents). However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default ----- (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; _provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders,_ more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank; provided that if a Regulated Bank is a Directing Holder or a beneficial owner directing DTC it shall provide a written representation to the Company that it is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee note and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. ----- If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants— Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60- day period. ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable,. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,240,CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES,240.1,Effect of Certain Contingencies,240.1.1,,"In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the notes in addition to stated principal and interest (e.g., in the circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Notes— Optional Redemption”) or at times other than the stated maturity date and stated interest payment dates. These potential payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt ----- instruments,” in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. One or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of these payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. This position is based on our determination that, as of the issue date of the notes, the possibility that these payments will have to be made is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a holder subject to United States federal income taxation may, among other potentially adverse tax consequences, be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate, and to treat any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Holders of notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for United States federal income tax purposes. Investors in the notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

As a result, the tax considerations of purchasing, owning, or disposing of the notes could differ from those described below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address United States federal income tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, including but not limited to banks or other financial institutions; individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts; tax-exempt entities; S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities; insurance companies; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; broker dealers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies; former citizens or residents of the United States subject to section 877 of the Code; controlled foreign corporations; non-United States trusts or estates with United States beneficiaries; passive foreign investment companies; corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax; taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax; persons required for United States federal income tax purposes to conform the timing of income accruals to their financial statements under section 451(b) of the Code; persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; or U.S. Holders (as defined below) that hold notes through non-United States brokers or other non-United States intermediaries.

Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws. It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Obligor could be opened in a different jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In particular, while the UK was a member state of the European Union (“EU”), insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020), EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European member state, including for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, recast, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “EU Judgments Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Brexit Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019). The Insolvency Brexit Regulations also effected key amendments to domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of a European member state opening insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Obligor may vary between member states; the implications of any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of recognition in the United Kingdom, would need to be carefully considered in each case. For instance, unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see “European Union” above). In addition, certain foreign courts may assume jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of an English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic ----- activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction or has a “sufficient connection” with that jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK, or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark), or which is incorporated in a member state of European Economic Area (“EEA Member State”). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the English Obligors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States or other insolvency laws. English insolvency laws and other limitations on the notes and the related guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the notes and the related guarantees against an English Obligor and may limit that amount that can be recovered under the notes or the related guarantees. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such certain limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees and/or under the Collateral and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any of the English Obligors (or any other obligor which may enter English law insolvency or restructuring proceedings).",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of the company’s property (see “—Qualifying Floating Charge” below as to what constitutes a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property)) and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily ----- harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority of Claims on Insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless (s)he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Subject to this, the administrator must perform their functions in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole. Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if an obligor were to enter into administration, the notes, the guarantees and collateral granted by that obligor, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided _that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). Accordingly, if an obligor were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the administrators. Contractual rights of set-off may also be available.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder ----- to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

That party will also be able to appoint an administrative receiver if the qualifying floating charge falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers, or if the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “Transactions at an Undervalue”, “Preference” and “Avoidance of Floating Charges” below).

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration” above). The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). ----- To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead and enforce their security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of Transactions” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act which, in the context of a non-English company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous ----- cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given case. Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors (although a creditor-led scheme nonetheless requires the consent of the company or its insolvency officeholders). If a simple majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or decline to sanction the scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the compromise of guarantees in order to ensure its effectiveness. The court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law of the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 and is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators). The consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholders) is required if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected stakeholders will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on their rights to be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights to be given under the restructuring plan. The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company need only show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. For a class of stakeholders to approve the restructuring plan, at least 75% in value, of those present and voting, at the meeting of that class, must vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving stakeholders to constitute a majority in number of those present and voting. The restructuring plan may still be sanctioned by the court even where certain classes do not vote in favor, provided the court is satisfied that: ----- (a) no member of a dissenting class would be any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and (b) at least one class who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan. The restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and consider whether to sanction the plan as a matter of its discretion. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies or, where the company is an overseas company, publication of the court’s order in the Gazette. As with schemes of arrangement, but unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings. Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class._ Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency setoff regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security_ and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest respectively; - _Second ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun, or a debtor company enters into administration, within 12 weeks following the end of any Insolvency Act Part A1 stand-alone moratorium (see “Moratoriums” below), moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts (however, as the moratorium is not available to companies which are party to “capital market arrangements” where the debt incurred or expected to be incurred is at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment, details of such debts are omitted), as well as, if applicable, any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company (which will take priority over the moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts); ----- - _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and (b) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1, 2020, claims by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including Value-added tax, Pay As You Earn income tax (including student loan repayments), employee National Insurance (“NI”) contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts; - _Fifth ranking:_ holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Sixth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any remaining debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the notes or the related guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid. This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the UK Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and - _Seventh ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligors’ assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the time.

It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction, or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency from the date of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the guarantees or setting aside security interests or guarantees. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings.

It will only be a preference if the company is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company gives the preference ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such influence.

The floating charge will not be invalid if, at the time it was created, the company was solvent and did not become insolvent as a result; however, this exception will not apply if the person in favor of whom it was created is connected. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. A liquidator or administrator can inform the relevant floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid (or only partly valid as regards new consideration). This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek to enforce the charge (which would then likely trigger an application from the office holder for a court declaration that the charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as to its validity.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security, namely: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding-up or administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full (the same does not apply to fixed charge assets); (c) as mentioned above, until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business; (d) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid pension contributions) where ----- the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement and subject to the ring fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors; and (f) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. Only with prior approval of the court can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the gross proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges, as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also “Administrative Receivership.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into entering the proposed transaction must be of corporate benefit for the English Obligors. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to have abused their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the UK Supreme Court has held that the shift takes place when the company in question is “insolvent or bordering on insolvency” (or an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable). Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not governed by English law) granted by a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset registry).

One of the key insolvency-related laws is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other enacting states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency ----- officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans may be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) where applicable. As of January 15, 2024, the UK Government has signed the Hague Convention as of July 2, 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention 2019”), which will come into force 12 months after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings commenced after that date. In addition, recognition may be available under principles of private international law and (in the case of EU member states other than Denmark) Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states are subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. As a result, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than it was during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states other than Denmark. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU or during the Transition Period. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.” During the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. After the expiration of the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the Rule 144A Global Note without compliance with these certification requirements. Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as set forth in “Notice to Investors” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.” Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/ Withdrawal at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note.

The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience ----- of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee or any of their agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the management or administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to acquire the notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or other applicable Similar Law to such an investment and to confirm that such acquisition and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or other applicable Similar Law.

A party in interest or disqualified person that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any ERISA Plan fiduciary that proposes to acquire and hold any notes with the assets of such ERISA Plan should consider, among other things, whether such acquisition and holding may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction with a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to such ERISA Plan and, if so, whether exemptive relief may be available for the transaction. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition or holding of the notes. These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an independent “qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to ----- investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions involving certain non-fiduciary service providers or their affiliates. One of these exemptions could provide an exemption for the acquisition and holding of the notes from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if its conditions are satisfied. However, there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any of these exemptions or of any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the ----- override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

Goodwill represents excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business combination are accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired based on their relative fair values without recognizing goodwill. Significant judgments are used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value and intangible asset useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty cost savings, and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Company’s current and future operating results.

Intangible assets consist of technology, customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames, and backlog. Other long-lived assets generally consist of property and equipment. ----- The Company’s intangible assets, other than backlog and those intangible assets classified as indefinite-lived, as well as the Company’s property and equipment, are depreciated or amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives, or lease term, on a pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets that are amortized to expense have estimated useful lives that range from eight to twenty-one years. Backlog is amortized, as a reduction of revenue, on a specific identification basis following the recognition of the revenue of the underlying contracts. Amortization of intangible assets charged to cost of revenue and operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $207.0 million, $206.9 million and $169.2 million, respectively. Backlog amortization expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was $6.2 million, $9.1 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to the Company, and trends in the fair value of the Company’s common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company, whose management uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has determined that it has one reporting unit. The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 on the single reporting unit and concluded that goodwill had not been impaired. Similar to the evaluation of those long-lived assets that are not amortized, the Company evaluates amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the assets, if any, are less than the carrying value of the assets. If an asset or asset group is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss, if any, represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Each period, the Company also evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its long-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. A considerable amount of judgment is required in performing an impairment analysis, principally in determining discount rates, and financial forecasts. Unanticipated changes in market conditions could have a material impact on the Company’s projected cash flows. Differences in actual cash flows as compared to the projected cash flows, as well as changes in market conditions, could require the Company to record additional impairment losses in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

As the customer can use and benefit from the license on its own, on-premise software licenses represent distinct performance obligations. Revenue for software licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when a license key is delivered to a customer, and the customer may use and benefit from the license. These licenses are sold as perpetual or for a fixed term. Perpetual licenses are generally invoiced upon execution of the contract Term licenses are generally invoiced upfront or on an annual basis over the term of the arrangement, which generally range from one to five years. Any difference between the license revenue recognized and the amount invoiced to the customer is accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as unbilled accounts receivable. The Company’s maintenance service consists of technical support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available unspecified software upgrades. As these maintenance services are considered to be a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress, the Company concludes that they represent one combined performance obligation. Maintenance revenue is therefore recognized ratably over the contract period. Any difference between the maintenance amount invoiced or collected and the maintenance revenue recognized is accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue. Professional services primarily include consulting and training services. In general, services are distinct performance obligations. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are delivered to the customer. The Company applies the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing for time and materials-based arrangements as the invoiced amount corresponds to the value of the services provided. The Company also sells several Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) hosted offerings. These SaaS hosted offerings are sold via a subscription-based model. Customers can use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of it and the services are available to them throughout the entire term, even if they do not use the service. As the services related to this model are indistinct from one another and have the same duration and measure of progress, revenue related to these offerings is recognized ratably over the contract period. SaaS arrangements are generally invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the arrangement. As part of the review over the transaction price, the Company considers whether there are any variable fees, such as usage-based arrangements, or price concessions that may give rise to variable consideration. Revenue related to variable consideration is recorded at the time of the transfer of licenses or services to its customers. Significant judgment is required in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company utilizes observable inputs when they exist, such as for maintenance renewals on historical perpetual license sales, and for SaaS hosted arrangements. The standalone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically the standalone selling prices for software licenses, are highly variable. In these instances, the Company estimates a narrow range of standalone selling prices using observable pricing information, such as the Company’s existing price list and historical sales data. When bundled term license and maintenance sales occur, the Company bifurcates the transaction into its two separate performance obligations, and then allocates the transaction value accordingly. The Company’s allocation between the term license and maintenance performance obligations is calculated based upon the observable relationship of the selling price of a standalone maintenance renewal to the related perpetual license fee, which is generally 20% of the net license fee for one year of maintenance. The Company considers using the observable relationship between a perpetual license fee and a standalone maintenance renewal to be appropriate for allocating value within a bundled arrangement because the nature of the respective performance obligations and the rights transferred to the customer are similar. As part of the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations, the Company considers the presence of any material rights or specified future upgrades that could represent additional performance obligations. ----- The Company did not identify any material right performance obligations in the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

International sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect revenue results. However, as most of the Company’s revenue comes from North American entities that operate in USD, this is not deemed to be a significant risk. The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. These customers operate based upon allocated budgets and appropriations. In the event that a government or agency enters into a multi-year contract and does not receive its expected allocated budget, it is possible that the existing contract could be terminated. However, the Company’s standard practice is for any multiyear contract to contain a substantive termination penalty, which provides evidence of enforceable rights and obligations throughout the stated contract term.

This occurs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to funding the project, and it is feasible that the project will be completed, and the software will perform the intended function. The Company ceases to capitalize costs related to a software project when it enters the postimplementation and operation stage. If different determinations are made with respect to the state of development of a software project, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially. Costs capitalized during the application development stage consist of payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time directly to, a project to develop software for internal use. The Company also capitalizes the direct costs of materials and services, which generally includes outside contractors, and interest. The Company does not capitalize any general and administrative or overhead costs or costs incurred during the application development stage related to training or data conversion costs. Costs related to upgrades and enhancements to internal-use software, if those upgrades and enhancements result in additional functionality, are capitalized. If upgrades and enhancements do not result in additional functionality, those costs are expensed as incurred. If different determinations are made with respect to whether upgrades or enhancements to software projects would result in additional functionality, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially. The Company amortizes capitalized costs with respect to development projects for internal-use software when the software is ready for use. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a 3-year period. In determining and reassessing the estimated useful life over which the cost incurred for the software should be amortized, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 capitalized software development costs were $7.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Additions relating to capitalized software development costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $0.6 million, $5.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.34,Recently adopted accounting pronouncements,243.34.1,,"In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform” under ASC _848, intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This guidance was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and the Company may apply the amendments prospectively to contract modifications made or relationships entered into or evaluated through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024. The Company adopted this ASU in 2023, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (""ASU 2016-13""), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of ""other-than-temporary"" impairments. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing ----- arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 201811, Targeted Improvements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2022 using the required modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as its date of initial application. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC 840. ASC 842 provides several optional practical expedients in transition. The Company applied the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced prior to the effective date whereby the following are not required to be reassessed: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) the treatment of initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company elected the short-term lease expedient for all leases that qualified based on a lease term of 12 months or less, and consequently a right-of-use asset or lease liability was not recognized for short term leases. Upon its adoption of ASC 842, the Company recorded lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at January 1, 2022 was used to calculate the present value of the Company’s lease portfolio as of that date. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of $29 million and right-of-use assets of $26 million on the Company’s balance sheet as of January 1, 2022, as well as a corresponding deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability of $7 million and $6 million, respectively. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s statements of operations and comprehensive loss or statements of cash flows. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 (“ASU 2019-12”), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. For non-public entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and for interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2022, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. On October 28, 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for _Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires_ an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure deferred revenue from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, rather than the prior requirement to record deferred revenue at fair value. Generally, this new guidance will result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, an entity that elects to early adopt in an interim period should apply the amendments to all business combinations that occurred during the fiscal year that includes that interim period. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a retrospective basis, effective on January 1, 2021.

This acquisition expands the ability of Rocket to develop and modernize mission-critical enterprise applications that deliver legendary business outcomes and solutions to customers. In accordance with the FASB’s ASC 805 Business Combinations, Rocket was determined to be the accounting acquirer. As such, Rocket applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of ASG, which have been measured at estimated fair value as of the date of the business combination. ASG’s assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair values primarily using Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant judgements related to future cash flows, discount rates, competitive trends, margin and revenue growth assumptions including royalty rates and customer attrition rates, market comparables and others. Inputs used were generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates. Since the Closing Date, the Company has made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the Closing Date. These adjustments primarily included an adjustment to conform ASG’s revenue recognition policy of allocating contract consideration to performance obligations to Rocket’s policy, and an adjustment to write off an IPR&D intangible asset that was initially measured. The table below incorporates the impact of the measurement period adjustments to date as well as the effect on the adoption of ASU 2021-08.

The United Kingdom net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain acquisition-related utilization limitations, which provide uncertainty with respect to their future realization. The total valuation allowance increased by $17.0 million during 2023, primarily related to the U.S. interest expense carryforwards and the increase in U.S. states tax credit carryforwards. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings of its subsidiaries in Australia and Switzerland and has specific and measurable plans to reinvest those earnings. The Company has determined that the deferred tax liability on the future repatriation of $7.7 million of unremitted earnings in Switzerland that are indefinitely reinvested is not material as of December 31, 2023. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on an annual basis, based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of $22.8 million, $25.6 million and $19.7 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year decrease relates primarily to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the increase associated with the uncertainty related to the sourcing of certain revenue for state tax purposes. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Company’s effective tax rate is $13.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The following is a tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands): ----- The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 total accrued interest and penalties were $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively. To the extent that tax attributes would be available to offset any tax associated with uncertain tax positions upon assessment by a taxing authority, the liabilities for such uncertain tax positions are recorded as reductions of the deferred tax assets for such attributes. Otherwise, the liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, are included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. However, carryforward attributes from prior years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if they are used in an open year. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax examinations could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in its estimates. The Company anticipates the expiration of certain statutes of limitations during 2024 that could result in a decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits between $6.5 million and $7.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception or upon modification of a contract and classifies each lease as either an operating or finance lease. The Company only reassesses lease classification subsequent to the commencement date if the contract is modified. Finance and operating lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset as lessee for the lease term, and lease obligations represent the Company’s obligation to ----- make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and obligations are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments, net of incentives, over the lease term. Generally, the Company's lease contracts do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, therefore, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease asset also reflects any lease payments made, initial direct costs incurred, and lease incentives received prior to commencement date. The Company’s lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised. Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These variable payments include insurance, taxes, payments tied to a consumer price index or other such indices, and payments for maintenance and utilities. For all leases, the Company does not separate lease components and non-lease components. Leases with an initial expected term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(“BCPE Holdings”) ratified and approved the adoption of the 2018 Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”), which authorizes BCPE Holdings to grant awards to members of the board, officers and employees of the Company in BCPE Holdings, which is the indirect parent of the Company. The Option Plan was adopted to incentive grant recipients to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company and its affiliates. In accordance with the Option Plan, BCPE Holdings also authorized 550,000 shares of the Class B Common Stock of BCPE Holdings (“Class B Stock”) to be granted in the form of nonqualified stock options. Stock compensation expense was $1.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The number of options granted to purchase Class B Stock were 39,737 and 95,026 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Options granted under the Option Plan are be exercisable only to the extent that they are vested. Option grants are divided into two vesting tranches: “Time-Vesting Options” and “Performance-Vesting Options,” with a 50% allocation to each tranche. Time-Vesting Options vest over a five-year period following the vesting start date (which is typically the grant date). Twenty percent of the Time-Vesting Options will vest on each anniversary of the grant date until all Time-Vested Options are fully-vested. All Time-Vesting options provide for accelerated vesting upon a change of control and 100% will vest upon a change in control; however, an initial public offering will not accelerate vesting. Performance-Vesting Options are subject to time and performance vesting and will only be fully vested when they have met both time and performance vesting requirements. Performance-Vesting Options will time vest in the same manner as Time-Vesting Options. Performance-Vesting Options will performance vest as follows: 50% vesting if funds associated with Bain Capital (“Sponsor”) Returns (as defined in the Option Plan) through the measurement date are at least two times the initial Sponsor investment and 100% vesting if Sponsor Returns are at least three times the initial Sponsor investment. An IPO may result in the accelerated vesting of PerformanceVesting Options. As of December 31, 2023, the grant date fair value of the Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Options were $11.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively. Remaining unrecognized compensation expense was $3.1 million for the unvested Time Vesting Options as of December 31, 2023 and is expected to be recognized over the related weighted average period of 2 years. The Company recorded compensation expense for the Time Vesting Options of $1.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which was included in general and administrative, cost of sales, research & development, and sales and marketing expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not deemed the achievement of the vesting criteria of the PerformanceVesting Options to be probable, and therefore there has been no compensation expense recorded for these performance-based vesting awards to date. Total unrecognized compensation expense was $10.6 million for the unvested Performance-Vesting Options as of December 31, 2023. The Company will reassess the probability of achieving investor return targets at the end of each reporting period.

Therefore, it estimates its expected option volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s equity interests is based on management’s estimate of time until a potential liquidity event. The risk-free rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for the time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends.

To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate products such as swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for a premium. During 2022 and 2023, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. These contracts have maturities of 23 months or less as of December 31, 2023. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entityspecific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 2 to Level 3.

1613,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.88,Independent Auditors’ Report,243.88.1,,"The Board of Directors Open Text Corporation: _Opinion_ We have audited the combined carveout financial statements of the AMC Business of Open Text Corporation (the AMC Business), which comprise the combined carveout balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related combined carveout statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the combined carveout financial statements. In our opinion, the accompanying combined carveout financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the AMC Business as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. _Basis for Opinion_ We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined Carveout Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the AMC Business and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. _Responsibilities of Management for the Combined Carveout Financial Statements_ Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the combined carveout financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of combined carveout financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the combined carveout financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the AMC Business’ ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the combined carveout financial statements are issued. ----- _Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined Carveout Financial Statements_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined carveout financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the combined carveout financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined carveout financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the combined carveout financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the AMC Business’ internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the combined carveout financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the AMC Business’ ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit. /s/ KPMG LLP Toronto, Canada March 28, 2024 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

Organization and Basis of Presentation _Organization_ The AMC Business (the “Business”), of Open Text Corporation (“OpenText”) includes Application Modernization & Connectivity (“AMC”), historically a product group of Micro Focus International Limited, formerly known as Micro Focus International PLC, (“Micro Focus”) and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OpenText Connectivity business (“OT Connectivity”), a product group of OpenText. OpenText acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus on January 31, 2023 (“the Acquisition”). The contribution of OT Connectivity is reflected as a transfer in of the OT Connectivity business in the Combined Carveout Statements of Cash Flows, which represents OT Connectivity's net assets as of the Acquisition date, which is mainly comprised of goodwill and net working capital, including accounts receivable and deferred revenues, and deferred tax assets. For the periods starting January 1, 2022 to the date of the Acquisition, reference to the “Parent” in these Combined Carveout Financial Statements is to Micro Focus. For the period after the Acquisition starting on February 1, 2023, reference to the “Parent” in these Combined Carveout Financial Statements is to Open Text. The Business provides market leading mainframe modernization and connectivity software and its solutions are categorized in the following areas: MF Common Business Oriented Language (“COBOL”), Host Connectivity, MF Enterprise Suite, Mainframe Application Development Life Cycle Management (“ADLM”) and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (“CORBA”). The MF COBOL product portfolio enables customers to develop, maintain, and deploy applications using COBOL across different platforms. Host Connectivity, which is the portfolio containing OT Connectivity includes products for enterprises to manage host access across desktop, web and mobile devices, manage mainframe access with enhanced security and integrate mainframe and host systems. MF Enterprise Suite is a mainframe application which helps enterprises move mainframe workloads to the cloud, therefore, reducing costs and increasing agility. Mainframe ADLM is comprised of products that offer enhanced mainframe applications which help shorten app delivery cycles, including faster development and deployment, strengthen security via multifactor authentication and data encryption, and optimize user interface experiences to boost productivity. The CORBA product facilitates distributed computing by providing a standard process for software components to request services and exchange data in a networked environment. On November 28, 2023, OpenText entered into a definitive agreement with Rocket Software, Inc. (“Rocket”), a Bain Capital portfolio company, involving the purchase and sale of the Business (the “Transaction”). Under the Transaction, OpenText will receive approximately $2.275 billion in cash at closing. Upon completion of the Transaction, the Business will be transferred by OpenText to a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket. _Basis of Presentation_ The Combined Carveout Financial Statements prior to the date of the Acquisition represent the financial information of AMC’s portion of the Business. Beginning February 1, 2023, the Combined Carveout Financial Statements represent the financial information combining AMC’s portion and OT Connectivity’s portion of the Business, which is the date on which both were under common control of OpenText. The Combined Carveout Financial Statements have been prepared on a “carve-out” basis. The periods presented were prepared on a standalone basis and have been derived from the accounting records of Micro Focus prior to the Acquisition and OpenText following the Acquisition. The Combined Carveout Financial Statements herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Prior to the date of the Acquisition, the accounting records and financial information of Micro Focus were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) and had a different fiscal year end. In preparing the Combined Carveout Financial Statements, the Business has aligned to a fiscal period ended December 31 and have converted any financial information to U.S. GAAP. ----- The historical results of income, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows presented in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements may not be indicative of what they would have been had the Business actually been an independent standalone entity, nor are they necessarily indicative of the Business’ future results of income, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows. It is not practicable to estimate actual costs that would have been incurred had the Business been a separate, standalone company. Financial information presented in the financial statements and notes herein is presented in thousands of U.S dollars, unless otherwise stated. The Combined Carveout Financial Statements include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Business and an allocation of expenses related to certain support services received from the Parent, such as, human resources, legal, finance, central and shared technology, and various other Parent corporate functions and overhead. These expenses have been attributed to the Business based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated using a reasonable methodology primarily on the basis of revenue or headcount. Management considers these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services or the benefits received. Corporate expense allocations were recorded in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income within the following captions: For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Cost of revenues $ 19,198 $ 15,462 Research and development expense 11,462 287 Sales and marketing expense 38,401 32,131 General and administrative expense 46,993 35,434 Other (income) expense, net (735) 3,262",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The Business determines the initial classification and measurement of the right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. ROU assets represent the right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is the Business’ obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease, over the contractual term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets based on the present value of future minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term. When available, the Business will use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, real estate leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore, the Business must estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The Business estimates the incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located. The ROU asset equals the lease liability, adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent and lease incentives on initial recognition. Fixed lease costs are included in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Variable lease costs are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. These variable lease payments are recognized in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments continues to be recognized in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable. The Business performs a qualitative assessment to test the reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessment, if the Business determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, the Business compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and the Business is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded. The Business has concluded that there is one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. The annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group.

Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules or delivering a training package customized to the customer’s needs. At the customer’s discretion, the Business may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or is a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract. As professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and customers can benefit from the Business’ professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, the Business considers professional services as distinct within the context of the contract. Professional service revenue is recognized over time so long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Business performs them, (ii) performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as the Business performs, and (iii) performance does not create an asset with alternative use and the Business has enforceable right to payment. If all the above criteria are met, the Business uses an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue.

If these criteria are not met, the Business determines an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of the Business’ overall promise for the single performance obligation.

The Business uses the residual approach only for license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within the established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and the Business will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support based on the relative SSP established for the respective performance obligations. ----- When two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, the Business evaluates the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts.

On that basis, contracts for license and maintenance typically do not contain a significant financing component, however, in determining the transaction price the Business considers whether there is a need to adjust the promised consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either the customer or the Business with a significant benefit of financing.

The Business has determined that certain of the commission programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Some commission programs are not subject to capitalization as the commission expense is paid and recognized as the related revenue is recognized. In assessing costs to obtain a contract, the Business applies a practical expedient that allows the Business to assess incremental costs on a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics instead of assessing the incremental costs on each individual contract. The Business does not expect the financial statement effects of applying this practical expedient to the portfolio of contracts to be materially different than if the Business were to apply the standard to each individual contract. The Business pays commissions on the sale of new customer contracts as well as for renewals of existing contracts to the extent the renewals generate incremental revenue. Commissions paid on renewal contracts are limited to the incremental new revenue and therefore these payments are not commensurate with the commission paid on the original sale. The Business allocates commission costs to the performance obligations in an arrangement consistent with the allocation of the transaction price. Commissions allocated to the license performance obligation are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to professional service performance obligations are expensed as incurred, as these contracts are generally for one year or less and the Business applies a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. Commissions allocated to customer support are capitalized and amortized consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the services over the period expected to benefit from the commission payment. As commissions paid on renewals are not commensurate with the original sale, the period of benefit considers anticipated renewals. The benefit period is estimated to be approximately six years which is based on customer contracts and the estimated life of technology. Expenses for incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract are recorded within “Sales and marketing” expense in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income.

Therefore, items such as net operating losses, credit carry-forwards and valuation allowances may exist in the stand-alone financial statements that may or may not exist in Parent’s consolidated financial statements. As such, the income taxes of the Business as presented in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements may not be indicative of the income taxes that the Business will generate in the future. Certain operations of the Business have historically been included in a consolidated tax return with other Parent entities. Current obligations or receivables are deemed settled with Parent as a component of net parent investment for purposes of the Combined Carveout Financial Statements. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements in the period to which they relate as if the Business were a separate filer. Deferred income taxes are recognized using the asset and liability method on temporary differences arising at the balance sheet date between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Business records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of all deductible temporary differences, carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable income will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are subject to review at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that future taxable income are considered to be inadequate to allow all or part of any deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis for the same tax-paying component within the same tax jurisdiction. The Business accounts for uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Business’ best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. The Business recognizes both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the “Provision for (recovery of) income taxes” line of the Combined Carveout Statements of Income (see Note 10 “Income Taxes” for more details). -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,376

The Parent has elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period, which in the Parent’s circumstance is the stated vesting period of the award, provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro-rata value of the award that has vested. Compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered.
