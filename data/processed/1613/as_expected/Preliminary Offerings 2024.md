PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONFIDENTIAL

#### $1,000,000,000

 Rocket Software, Inc.

#####      % Senior Secured Notes due 2028

The Offering:

- Rocket Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), is offering $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % senior secured notes due 2028 (the “notes”). The notes are
being issued in connection with our proposed acquisition (the “AMC Acquisition”) of the Application Modernization and Connectivity business (the “AMC business”) of Open Text
Corporation (“OpenText”).

- Use of Proceeds: We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, together with borrowings under our Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities (as defined herein), proceeds
from the Equity Contribution (as defined herein) and cash on hand, to (i) finance and consummate the AMC Acquisition and (ii) pay transaction expenses and fees in connection with the
foregoing. See “Use of Proceeds.”

- Escrow: This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition. If the issue date of the notes occurs prior to the date that the AMC Acquisition is consummated
(the “Acquisition Date”), the Issuer will execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein) on the issue date of the notes and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, an amount
equal to the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account” and the funds deposited therein, the “Escrowed Property”) for the benefit of the
holders of the notes pending the consummation of the AMC Acquisition. The release of Escrowed Property to the Issuer to consummate the AMC Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions (the “Escrow Release Conditions”), including the closing of the AMC Acquisition substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of the Escrowed
Property. The consummation of the AMC Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the regulatory
conditions in the Acquisition Agreement (as defined herein) have been satisfied. If (i) the closing of the AMC Acquisition has not occurred on or prior to July 5, 2024, (such date, the “Outside
Date”), (ii) we notify the Trustee in writing prior to the Outside Date that we will not pursue the consummation of the AMC Acquisition or (iii) the Acquisition Agreement has been terminated
prior to the Outside Date without the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from and including the issue date of the notes, or the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the notes, whichever
is later, to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the notes, which
is included in the special mandatory redemption price. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The Senior Notes:

- Maturity: The notes will mature on November 28, 2028.

- Interest: The notes will bear interest at a rate of      % per annum. Interest on the notes will accrue from     , 2024 and will be payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on      and
of each year, commencing     , 2024.

- Guarantees: If the offering of the notes is consummated prior to the Acquisition Date, then prior to the Acquisition Date and pending the release of the Escrowed Property, if applicable, the
notes will not be guaranteed. From and after the Acquisition Date and following the release of the Escrowed Property, if applicable, the notes will be jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully
and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Issuer’s then current and future (i) wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and (ii) wholly-owned restricted
subsidiaries organized under the laws of England or Wales that guarantee or will guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) (collectively, the “Guarantors”).

- Security: If the offering of the notes is consummated prior to the Acquisition Date, then prior to the Acquisition Date and pending the release of the Escrowed Property, if applicable, the notes
will be secured only by a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and Escrowed Property. From and after the Acquisition Date and following the release of the Escrowed Property,
if applicable, the notes and related guarantees will be secured by a first-priority lien, subject to permitted liens, on all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future assets that secure
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

- Ranking: From and after the Acquisition Date and following the release of the Escrowed Property, if applicable, the notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
senior secured obligations and will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively senior in right of payment
to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future junior lien and unsecured senior debt, including the Existing Notes (as defined below), to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing the notes, and equal in right of payment to any indebtedness secured on an equal-priority basis, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The notes will rank equally in right of
payment with any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under any existing and future senior indebtedness and other obligations that are not, by their terms expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the notes, including the Existing Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, without giving effect to collateral arrangements. The notes will rank senior in right of
payment to any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other
liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.

- Optional Redemption and Repurchase: We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to    , 2025 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium and, at any time on or after    , 2025, at the redemption prices specified under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, at any time prior to     , 2025, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds
of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price specified under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” In addition, until     , 2025, we may redeem up to 10% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the notes during each twelve-month period commencing from the issue date of the notes at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we experience certain change of control triggering events, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to
repurchase the notes under the terms set forth herein. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

_Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29._
**Offering Price for the notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from     , 2024**
The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being
offered and sold only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons
in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. For details about eligible offers, deemed representations and agreements by investors and transfer restrictions, see “Notice to Investors.”
The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to investors only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the benefit of its participants, including
Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on or about     , 2024. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers and sales
of securities that do not involve a public offering. The notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer
and sale of the notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the notes are delivered must
inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission required for the
purchase, offer or sale by you of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction to which you are
subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we, the initial purchasers nor the joint
bookrunners will have any responsibility therefor.

By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and
agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial purchasers
and the joint bookrunners are not, making an offer to sell the notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is


-----

permitted. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an
indefinite period of time.

This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but
we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss in this offering
memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such documents, our
business and the terms of the offering and the notes, including the merits and risks involved.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an opportunity
to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to
supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers
or the joint bookrunners or any person affiliated with any of the initial purchasers or the joint bookrunners in
connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering
memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (4) no person has
been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the notes described
in this offering memorandum, other than as contained in this offering memorandum and information given by our duly
authorized officers and employees in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of the offering of
the notes.

This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only be distributed and
disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided.

We make no representation to you that the notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider any
information in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney,
business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an investment in the notes. Neither the
delivery of the offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this offering memorandum implies that any
information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date after the date of this offering memorandum.

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional information
to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also reserve the
right to reject, cancel or modify any order to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason, to sell less than the
entire principal amount of the notes offered in this offering memorandum and to allot to any prospective investor less
than the full amount of notes sought by such investor.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market
price of the notes at a higher level than the notes might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see the section “Plan of
Distribution” in this offering memorandum.

Neither the initial purchasers nor the joint bookrunners make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this
offering memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the
future.

This offering memorandum is strictly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the
proposed offering of the notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is personal to each
offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire
the notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any,
retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and any disclosure of any
of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum,
you agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering memorandum or any
documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum.


-----

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or
disapproved of these securities or determined if this offering memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation
to the contrary is a criminal offense.

This offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and it does
not comply in important respects with SEC rules that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering
of securities.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about     , 2024, which will be the     business
day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule
15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market
are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during
such period should consult their own advisors.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain historical financial data of the Issuer and the AMC business. This
offering memorandum contains the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).

This offering memorandum also contains the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business.
The AMC business includes historically a product group of Micro Focus International Limited (“Micro Focus”) and,
beginning February 1, 2023, the OpenText Connectivity business (“OT Connectivity”), a product group of OpenText.
OpenText acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus on January 31, 2023 (the “MF
Acquisition”). The AMC business has historically operated as part of Micro Focus or, following acquisition thereof,
OpenText and not as a standalone company. The audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are presented on a “carve-out” basis from (i) Micro Focus’s
accounting records for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 and (ii) OpenText’s accounting records
for the period from and after February 1, 2023, using the historical results of operations, cash flows, assets and
liabilities of the AMC business. For the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023, the audited combined
carveout financial statements of the AMC business exclude OT Connectivity. The audited combined carveout financial
statements of the AMC business include allocations of corporate expenses and shared expenses from Micro Focus for
the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 (prior to the MF Acquisition) and OpenText for the period from
and after February 1, 2023 (following the MF Acquisition). These allocations reflect significant assumptions and the
combined financial statements may not fully reflect what the AMC business’s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows would have been had it been a standalone company during the periods presented. As a result, the audited
combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are
not necessarily indicative of the AMC business’s future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The
audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business were prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Except as expressly noted, OpenText has not prepared or reviewed any information about the AMC business or the
combined business for this offering memorandum or confirmed the accuracy of the information included in this
offering memorandum. Additionally, the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business that
are included in this offering memorandum have not been separately filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by OpenText.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We have included certain financial measures that are not based on GAAP in this offering memorandum, including
Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue, Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, Non-GAAP Gross Profit, EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow
and Free Cash Flow Conversion with respect to the Issuer and the AMC business, as applicable (collectively, the
“Non-GAAP Metrics”). We believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating


-----

performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core
business. We believe that they provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of
our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital
expenditures. We use these measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to
that of our competitors.

Certain of our Non-GAAP Metrics have been calculated utilizing accounting principles not consistent with GAAP,
including recognizing revenue on an Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) basis rather than in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC
606”). A primary difference between ARR and ASC 606 is the accounting for license revenue in our subscription or
term license arrangements, which is annualized and recognized over the contract term under our ARR method, while
recognized at a point in time, generally at the inception of the contract term, under ASC 606.

Our use of the Non-GAAP Metrics varies from others in our industry. Our Non-GAAP Metrics should not be
considered as alternatives to net income (loss), revenue or other measures of performance derived in accordance with
GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows or as measures of liquidity.

Our Non-GAAP Metrics have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation
or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

    - such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

    - such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - such measures do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to
service interest payments, on our debts;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for
such replacements;

    - non-cash compensation, including in connection with certain acquisitions, is and will remain an element
of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when
evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period;

    - such measures do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

    - such measures reflect estimated cost savings and synergies that may not be achieved; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

In this offering memorandum, we disclose the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the Issuer and the AMC business
on a standalone and pro forma basis, as applicable. Some of the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business
were prepared by us based on certain financial information obtained through our financial diligence process. The
methodology for preparing such financial information is different than the methodology used by OpenText to prepare
the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business (including with respect to the allocation of
shared costs) and such Non-GAAP Metrics should therefore not be viewed as substitutes for the AMC business’s
results as reported under GAAP. OpenText neither prepared nor reviewed these Non-GAAP Metrics, and OpenText
does not utilize any such Non-GAAP Metrics in its own reporting with respect to the AMC business. We have not yet
closed the AMC Acquisition, and the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business are therefore subject to
certain adjustments and changes after we close the AMC Acquisition and integrate the AMC business into our own
business.


-----

For a more detailed discussion and reconciliations of our Non-GAAP Metrics to their most directly comparable GAAP
measures, see “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, in particular
with respect to (a) the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures (as described above) and (b) the
presentation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in the section entitled “Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

In addition, in “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information,” the “Pro Forma”
information presented under the “Pro Forma” column for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects certain
adjustments as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” that were not
applied to the “Pro Forma” information presented under the “Historical” columns for the years ended December 31,
2023, 2022 and 2021, including Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run
Rate Cash EBITDA Margin and certain other Non-GAAP Metrics. These metrics are therefore not fully comparable.
Furthermore, the Non-GAAP Metrics that include the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not
include the same pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information for the year ended December
31, 2023 and as set forth in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and represent a
management combined presentation whereby the Non-GAAP Metrics of the AMC business for the year ended
December 31, 2022 were added together with the Non-GAAP Metrics of Rocket for the same year, with certain
adjustments as described in “Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of securities laws. You should
not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our liquidity
and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies. These
statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,”
“may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on certain assumptions that we have made in light of our
experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future
developments and other factors we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this
offering memorandum, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could affect our actual financial results and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some important factors
include:

    - the potential impact of, and any potential developments related to, the AMC Acquisition;

    - potential loss of significant revenue from our long-term partnership with IBM;

    - failure by our customers to renew their contracts with us;

    - our inability to attract new customers or convert single-product customers into multi-product customers
in a cost-effective manner;

    - failure to accurately predict, prepare for and respond to rapidly evolving technological and market
developments, including the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and other machine learning technologies;

    - disruption, discovery of errors in or risks related to our software solutions;

    - cyber-attacks on our networks and actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products;

    - lack of availability, integrity and security of information technology (“IT”) systems that our business
and products depend on;


-----

    - failure to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees and other key personnel;

    - failure to access or rely on third-party products;

    - risks associated with the use of open source software;

    - our significant competition;

    - our ability to continue to invest in adequate research and development resources;

    - damage to our reputation;

    - our ability to meet growth and productivity objectives;

    - our use of estimates and assumptions used to determine the size of our target market;

    - failure to appropriately price our products and services;

    - our indirect distribution channels;

    - lack of compatibility between our products and the ever-changing operating and database environments
and failure to support older versions of our products and services;

    - global economic, political and market conditions;

    - third party claims that our software products or services infringe their intellectual property rights;

    - failure by our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights to protect our technologies;

    - our ability to achieve successful business combinations, including the AMC Acquisition;

    - our ability to timely realize all of the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition;

    - the significant one-time integration costs we will incur in connection with the AMC Acquisition;

    - certain risks if the notes are issued prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition and proceeds are
deposited into the Escrow Account;

    - our ability to manage the expanded operations following the AMC Acquisition; and

    - other risks referenced in “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements contained in this offering
memorandum might not prove to be accurate and you should not place undue reliance upon them. All forward-looking
statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing
cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update
or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all
risk factors and uncertainties.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary contains basic information about our company and the offering. It may not contain all the information_
_that may be important to you. Investors should carefully read this entire offering memorandum, including the_
_information set forth under “Risk Factors” and in our audited financial statements and related notes included_
_elsewhere in this offering memorandum before making an investment decision._

_Unless we indicate otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Rocket,” “we,” “us,” “our” and_
_the “Company” refer to Rocket Software, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries._

**Our Company**

Rocket is a leading global enterprise software provider with a broad portfolio of products that help corporations,
government agencies, and other organizations run their mission-critical IT operations. We enable small and large
enterprises in many industries to maximize their data, systems and infrastructure to deliver critical services that power
our modern world. Our software runs, optimizes and protects our customers’ applications, servers and databases, and
integrates these core platforms with the rest of the enterprise, while providing a full-stack of modernization solutions.
Our products enable customers to carry out their most mission-critical business functions, such as processing payment
transactions at global financial institutions and maintaining healthcare records at hospitals and insurance companies.

Since our founding over 30 years ago, we have cultivated a customer-centric culture with strategic investments in
research and development (“R&D”) that provide a wide range of solutions to meet customers’ evolving needs. We
have evolved from solely maintaining legacy infrastructure to facilitating modernization journeys to connect
mainframe to the hybrid cloud environment. We have accomplished this evolution through substantial R&D efforts,
highlighted by over $500 million in investments into R&D since 2020, as well as multiple acquisitions that have
expanded our modernization offering.

Given our focus on supporting our customers’ mission-critical business functions, our products address deeply
embedded technologies that sit at the core of enterprise IT infrastructure. These systems have evolved over multiple
decades and, particularly for our largest customers, represent billions of dollars of cumulative custom application
development and IT infrastructure investment. As enterprises look to the future, hybrid remains vital to enabling the
deployment of cloud environments as it incorporates client server computing, cloud-based platforms, and modern
connectivity and portability.

We seek to enable our customers to experience the best of both the cloud and the mainframe, putting relevant
workloads in the cloud while leveraging the mainframe for its best features – security, reliability, and governance.
Our strategy is to modernize without disruption, meeting customers where they are in their modernization journey. By
utilizing our product portfolio, customers can modernize effectively, even incrementally, integrating new technologies
while preserving and leveraging the robust foundation already in place for a seamless technological evolution. We
believe this approach dramatically lowers risk and improves success rates of IT system modernization projects.

As the pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, we believe our customers will increasingly look to us to
extract greater value from existing IT systems and applications through innovation, integration, optimization and
modernization.

Today, Rocket is organized into three main business units focused on Infrastructure Modernization, Data
Modernization and Application Modernization. While each business unit has its own technical requirements and
products, we go to market using a holistic approach to solving our customers’ problems, utilizing solutions across our
business units to help drive operating efficiencies among overlapping buying centers to best position us to drive future
growth. These business units are as follows:

_Infrastructure Modernization: Our Infrastructure Modernization business unit represents approximately_
55% of our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It comprises software solutions built
for integrating and optimizing mainframe workloads, mitigating security and compliance risks and
optimizing storage. Organizations can leverage our range of solutions to support mainframe security and


-----

compliance in the face of new threats and deliver optimized mainframe performance management and
interoperability. The mainframe continues to be an integral part of modern-day IT infrastructure and
provides a reliable architecture for high-volume data processing and transactions. Mainframes provide a
level of five 9s of availability (99.999%), which is several orders of magnitude higher than alternative
distributed servers, making mainframes the optimal platform for mission-critical processes. Additionally,
mainframes are uniquely engineered to process millions of input and output calculations per second, which
is a key difference from distributed servers that are designed to be more general purpose, limiting their
ability to perform a specialized task extremely well. Consequently, mainframes provide a range of
advantages over distributed systems that are likely to persist, and we believe organizations in regulated and
data intensive industries will continue to rely on mainframe systems to process high-volume, missioncritical activity at the core of their IT infrastructures.

_Data Modernization: Our Data Modernization business unit represents approximately 18% of our_
standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It provides software solutions to connect
mission-critical data residing on the mainframe and distributed systems to advanced applications and
compute workloads running on private and public cloud environments. As organizations increasingly adopt
a hybrid cloud infrastructure approach to operations, effectively navigating the complexities of data
governance and compliance while maximizing data utilization is critical. Our solutions address this
challenge by eliminating data siloes to enhance decision-making and customer experience while maintaining
strong data governance, security, scalability and dynamic availability. For example, one of our key products,
Mobius, enables customers to integrate seamlessly with third-party repositories, facilitating secure and
efficient data movement between modern and legacy systems. Our track record of successfully integrating
acquisitions within this business unit highlights our commitment to providing an end-to-end offering that
reframes customer engagement strategies and paves the way for future growth.

_Application Modernization: Our Application Modernization business unit represents the remaining 27% of_
our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It is comprised of a portfolio of solutions
aimed at improving application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating
modern workflows for legacy applications. While Application Modernization covers both distributed offmainframe platforms and mainframe environments, many of the most important back-end applications for
large enterprises still reside on the mainframe and have yet to be modernized. With key offerings including
database management, DevOps, and low-code application development platforms, we enable organizations
to efficiently deliver reliable, scalable and secure applications to support their core business needs. One of
our key innovations has been to enable enterprise adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid
cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern development practices even for legacy systems.

Across these three business units, we serve over 12,500 end-user customers, pro forma for the AMC Acquisition. Our
customer base spans every major industry vertical and includes some of the largest companies in the world, including
43 of the Fortune 50, as of 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). Our customer base is highly
diversified with the top ten Rocket-led customers representing just 14% of revenue in the year ended December 31,
2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition).

In addition to these deeply embedded and long-term customer relationships, we have also cultivated a number of
partnerships that are critical to our business. Our largest partnership is with IBM. We generate approximately 23% of
our revenue through IBM-led sales. Through a series of organic R&D investments, acquisitions, joint development
efforts and a strong go-to-market (“GTM”) partnership, we have become one of IBM’s most trusted software partners.
This partnership has evolved over 30 years and is driven primarily by our expertise in mainframe and mid-range
servers of which IBM is a major manufacturer. Our software enhances and creates efficiencies for IBM’s customers
and extends the life of IBM’s core platforms. In partnership with IBM, we develop and support core software offerings
in their portfolio, freeing IBM to redirect their R&D spend to other areas. As part of our partnership with IBM,
numerous Rocket products are re-branded as IBM products and sold through their global salesforce.

While we are committed to remaining a high-quality business partner to IBM and extending the lifetime value of core
IBM-led products, we are working to increase the share of Rocket-led sales to further diversify our revenue. Our
Rocket-led GTM strategy, whether executed directly or through our channel partners, allows us to provide best-in

-----

class support to our customers in managing their mainframe and modernization journey, particularly as they move
towards a hybrid cloud environment.

We are headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and maintain a large global footprint with significant operations in
North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. As of December 31, 2023 we had 2,200 employees
(excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition) worldwide with a presence in 13 global offices. Following the AMC
Acquisition, we expect to have approximately 3,000 Rocketeers and 20 global offices. This worldwide coverage
provides us with access to economies of scale, lower cost offshore operations, high-growth emerging markets and
global support for our increasingly global customer base.

**Acquisition of Application Modernization and Connectivity**

On November 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the AMC business of OpenText, which
includes historically a product group of Micro Focus and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OT Connectivity business,
a product group of OpenText, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments.
For more information, see “––The AMC Acquisition.”

The AMC business has been a leader in application modernization for many years with a focus on mainframe
replatforming solutions that help with the migration and operation of mainframe workloads to distributed and cloud
environments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the AMC business generated Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue
of $504 million and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA of $307 million. AMC Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue is
comprised of (x) for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $355 million of ARR, $108 million of
perpetual license revenue and $13 million of professional service revenue, and (y) for the year ended December 31,
2023, approximately $364 million of ARR, $121 million of perpetual license revenue and $20 million of professional
services revenue. The AMC business operates within five portfolio segments that form a comprehensive suite for
mainframe application development, maintenance and modernization:

_Enterprise Suite: The AMC business’s Enterprise Suite business unit represents approximately 18% of its_
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution is the AMC business’s fastest growing product
line, providing end-to-end mainframe workload migration tools including migration analysis, test and
deployment tools and an enterprise server that emulates the mainframe environment in the cloud. The
Enterprise Suite helps organizations move mainframe workloads to run on distributed environments with a
significantly lower degree of code change relative to other complex migration options like refactoring.
Within the Enterprise Suite, four core tools address different stages of workload migration and application
development. The Analyzer, Developer and Enterprise Test Server are focused on delivering diagnostic
tools, modern Integrated Development Environments (“IDE”) and virtual test environments. The Enterprise
Server provides a multi-platform production environment to replatform IBM z/OS applications. The revenue
derived from Enterprise Server is highly recurring in nature and allows for an emulated mainframe on cloud
environments with the ability to run mission-critical applications.

_COBOL: The AMC business’s Common Business Oriented Language (“COBOL”) business unit represents_
approximately 36% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution enables
organizations to develop, maintain and deploy COBOL based applications across the enterprise using
modern DevOps tools and platforms. COBOL is a legacy programming language that is integral to the
majority of mission-critical applications. As most developers lack experience working in COBOL, a modern
set of DevOps tools enables enterprises to modernize and update their most important applications. The
AMC business’s tools provide an IDE for analyzing and editing COBOL in applications primarily offmainframe, providing developers with visualizations and coding environments similar to modern IDEs. As
one indicator of the AMC business’s market position, the AMC business is the only official COBOL
compiler available on Cloud Service Providers’ (“CSPs”) marketplaces.

_Host Connectivity: The AMC business’s Host Connectivity business unit represents approximately 32% of_
its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution includes mainframe terminal emulators and
plugins for application access, process automation and security solutions. Customer use cases include
providing flexible access to mission-critical applications running on mainframe environments via modern,
distributed systems (desktop, web and mobile) in a secure and compliant manner (i.e. multi factor


-----

authentication). The AMC business’s Host Connectivity tools provide a broad number of options that allow
for significant customization to deliver strong, auditable and compliant security that meets organizations’
requirements.

_Mainframe Application Development Life Cycle Management (“ADLM”): The AMC business’s Mainframe_
ADLM business unit represents approximately 11% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.
This solution provides mainframe source code change, configuration and management enabling
organizations to modernize and integrate mainframes across new technologies and platforms. This results
in shorter app delivery cycles, stronger security and increased productivity. Customer use cases include
version control functionality to track changes made to source code (i.e. ChangeMan ZMF), change
management workflow, release management and automation, automated testing, auditing and reporting.

_CORBA: The AMC business’s Common Object Request Broker Architecture (“CORBA”) business unit_
represents approximately 3% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides
middleware for communication across distributed applications. CORBA add-on solutions enable any
CORBA application to take advantage of new deployment models, including cloud, containers and virtual
environments or to extend and re-use existing CORBA resources without prior knowledge of CORBA
technology. These solutions are used in telecommunications for managing network elements and the
integration of different vendor equipment, in military and defense for building command and control
systems and in finance for trading and risk management systems.

The AMC Acquisition represents a highly complementary addition to our product portfolio, with the AMC business
expected to further build out a more diverse modernization portfolio that aligns with customer demands and allows us
to meet our customers wherever they are on their modernization journey. The AMC Acquisition is expected to achieve
key strategic objectives, including:

  - Expanding the product portfolio with a stronger, more comprehensive modernization offering that is able to
meet customers at any stage of their IT modernization journey, whether modernizing in place, migrating
select workloads to hybrid environments or replatforming;

  - Providing a full-stack of products and solutions to enable end-to-end modernization without the disruption
of existing workflows and allow customers to derive value from their decades of investment in core
applications;

  - Expanding customer reach through deeper and broader customer engagement across Fortune 2000 accounts
for greater retention and cross-selling. A more comprehensive and complete offering solidifies Rocket as the
strategic partner of choice to address customer needs, tapping into developer-led decisions and guiding

Acquiring the AMC business’s replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs, including Google Cloud
Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure, is expected to enable us to tap into new budget pools and
augment our existing hybrid cloud solutions suite. Rocket has broken down the boundaries of on-premises and cloud


-----

computing so that businesses can connect IT systems and modern applications. The seamless data flow, data
integration and continuous enhancements create benefits like streamlined processes, improved efficiencies, and better
return on investment so that customers can be more dynamic, secure, and agile in the face of an increasingly complex
IT and business environment. Access to the AMC business’s additional software developers will drive increased
innovation and development of better solutions to accelerate a shift to a hybrid cloud environment, reinforcing our
commitment to our customer-centric R&D efforts. This move is expected to further strengthen our position as the
partner of choice for mission-critical IT modernization.

**Our GTM Strategy**

Our marketing and GTM strategies are driven, first and foremost, to deliver the right solutions to customers, regardless
of channel. To that end, our sales and marketing efforts are bifurcated between our Rocket-led products and our IBMled products, each of which have their own strategies.

Our Rocket-led products are sold through two primary avenues: (1) direct to customer through our centralized
customer success, support and delivery teams and (2) channel partners.

  - Our direct sales force and marketing investment, which is focused on Rocket-led solutions, is shifting the
dialogue from mainframe buying centers to a Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) and Chief Product Officer
(“CPO”) strategy covering the expanse of Rocket use cases. We rely on marketing to drive brand awareness,
generate leads across our growth product areas and support subscription and maintenance renewals by
reinforcing the value delivered by our new releases and product innovation. Through our 30-year operating
history and over 50 acquisitions, we have a strong base of customers that we continually look to serve with
our growing portfolio of solutions. Our sales force targets both existing customers and new logo opportunities
and is comprised of a global set of enterprise sales professionals focused on account relationships. Our
enterprise sales professionals are product specialists who focus on selling our solutions with our solutions
engineers providing technical guidance to customers throughout the sales process. This team handles new
sales as well as up-sells and cross-sells within existing accounts, further driving revenue expansion. Renewals
of existing maintenance contracts and subscriptions are handled by our centralized renewal team, who have
helped to drive our consistently high renewal rates.

  - In addition to our direct sales force, our Rocket-led sales organization also leads our strategic alliances. Our
10 strategic channel partner relationships consist of resellers, distributors and systems integrators who embed
our solutions in other software applications and help to deliver new solutions to market. Our strong
relationships with Independent Software Vendors (“ISVs”) and Managed Service Providers (“MSPs”) enable
us to better reach both current and potential customers, and these strong MSP relationships also support
customers using MSPs to manage their mainframe.

For our IBM-led products, we have a dedicated sales enablement team across the IBM Original Equipment
Manufacturer (“OEM”) product segments, all backed by a 30-year longstanding partnership driving us and IBM to
partner on opportunities and deployments. These joint Rocket-IBM sales and marketing initiatives allow us to drive
demand, refine messaging, enable sales and strengthen win rates for our IBM-led products, which continue to have
strong retention rates supported by the strength of our partnership with IBM. In addition to benefits that we realize
from the partnership, IBM also leverages us to support the broader mainframe industry and expand value delivered
from incumbent involvement.

Ultimately, our powerful GTM strategy is bolstered by a centralized customer success and support effort with global
coverage, a dedicated team focused on renewals and driving upsell and cross-sell opportunities across the installed
base, numerous strategic alliances that help market and distribute our solutions and a robust partnership with IBM.
The combination of these factors forms our strong customer success engine and continues to help us drive strong
retention rates.

We have further built our business to serve the expanding needs of our customers and address growing budget pools
that are focused on digital transformation. We’ve transitioned from a focus on providing solutions to the head of
infrastructure to addressing a head of applications or a Chief Data Officer who is focused on driving revenue
generation of their business. Whether it is the CIO or the Chief Data Officer, we have solutions that address their


-----

mission-critical challenges and our GTM approach ensures that we serve the different needs of our expanded buyer
set. The combined forces of Rocket and the AMC business are expected to create a broader product offering that
serves the entire modernization continuum, all in a single partner.

As one example of how the AMC Acquisition will help broaden our product offering and modernization capabilities,
we expect the AMC business to provide us with additional GTM channels to tap into CSP budget pools given the
AMC business’s strength in replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs. We believe this will further
elevate Rocket’s status with MSPs, CSPs and other key ecosystem participants, further strengthening and
differentiating our GTM strategy.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

_Deep and Embedded Portfolio of Solutions Meets Customer Needs Across Environments_

Since our founding, we have focused strategically on innovation to develop and enhance our software solutions to
consistently meet our customers’ evolving needs. Our portfolio of solutions represents a full-stack of purpose-built
products tailored to various end markets. Within each of these environments, we address customer pain points at every
layer of their IT system. This ranges from the core IT infrastructure (i.e. software tooling for the mainframe itself or
an embedded database) to newly developed applications that are open source in nature and run in the cloud but need
to integrate with the more traditional components of a customer’s IT system. In delivering this comprehensive portfolio
of products, we focus on opportunities categorized within our three synergistic business lines: Infrastructure
Modernization, Data Modernization and Application Modernization. We expect the AMC Acquisition to bring a suite

and Legal Officers, but also two new Business Unit Presidents. These strategic new hires bring with them strong
connections with IBM and other key channel partners. We maintain a partnership framework with IBM executives
that facilitates alignment with functions within IBM and Rocket and, across the organization, our executives and
business unit leaders maintain regular dialogue with their IBM counterparts.

Following the AMC Acquisition, we expect to hire Stuart McGill, the current Chief Revenue Officer of the AMC
business, who has been with the company since 1984, and Neil Fowler, the current Chief Technology Officer of the
AMC business, who has been with the company since 1991. Mr. McGill and Mr. Fowler would bring decades of
experience and expertise to our already talented management team.

We believe that our success in steadily growing Rocket as a cash-flow generative company has greatly benefitted from
these strategic hires, and we anticipate continued success in the future.

**Our Strategy**

_Embrace Hybrid Cloud to Enable Enterprises to Unlock New Capabilities and Growth Opportunities and_
_Simultaneously Optimize Mission-Critical Systems_

Through our strategy of enabling enterprises to embrace and innovate with hybrid cloud, companies can deploy,
execute and manage workloads, applications and data agnostic of their chosen infrastructure in a seamless and
transparent manner from mainframe to cloud. This approach allows enterprises to not only maximize the full potential
and value of their data stored on mainframe, but also leverage that data to drive decisions and insights from cloudnative capabilities, including AI, ML and advanced analytics. One of our key innovations has been to enable enterprise
adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern
development practices even for legacy systems and which we expect the AMC Acquisition to further enhance. This
will empower our customers as they pursue their modernization journeys, and we are right there with them. Ultimately,
this narrative aligns the technology investments made by enterprises with their key business outcomes, providing
customers with a complete lifecycle of solutions and letting them focus on business without worrying about the
constraints of their current technology architecture.

_Focus on R&D and Investment in Product Portfolio_

Since 2020, we have invested $521 million in R&D initiatives. With nearly 1,900 Rocketeer Engineers (pro forma for
the AMC Acquisition) and an R&D presence in five continents, our R&D investment is the cornerstone of our ability
to innovate, enabling us to better address customer needs, retain existing accounts and attract new business. It also
allows us to provide full-stack solutions to our customers, which we believe, in conjunction with our powerful GTM
team and strategy, will ultimately drive strong retention rates among our installed bases. Our customer-centric R&D
shows our true understanding of the different needs of our customers and buyers who are looking to modernize their
infrastructure, reinforcing, and magnifying our commitment to innovation. Additionally, because we’ve scaled the
business so significantly through both organic and inorganic growth, we’ve managed to achieve significant scale
efficiency in our R&D investments.

_Support Full-Stack Modernization and Tap into Multiple Budget Pools_

We provide a full-stack of infrastructure, application, and data modernization solutions, allowing companies to
integrate legacy and distributed systems with modern cloud capabilities. This full-stack of IT system modernization
solutions allows us to tap into multiple budget pools, including those covered by the CIO, Chief Data Officer, Head
of Applications, Chief Information Security Officer, Head of Infrastructure and more. With our suite of products and
solutions, we can help companies ensure that their existing infrastructure is able to successfully deliver digital
transformation initiatives and provide competitive advantages; deliver new mission-critical applications across hybrid
infrastructures; govern and access key data and content to strengthen customer relationships and ensure compliance;
and drive key initiatives to secure and protect data across the broader enterprise. This multi-layered approach opens
corporate budgets beyond the mainframe and infrastructure-centric buyer and expands our wallet share to larger digital
transformation initiatives that we can access through upsell and cross-sell opportunities.


-----

_Maintain Our Strong Operational Efficiency and Profitability_

Our focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management has helped us to maintain consistently high
Adjusted EBITDA margins. This commitment to cost control has enabled our ongoing investments in R&D to further
expand our solution footprint. We believe this continued emphasis on cost control results in attractive operating
leverage and cash flow generation.

_Pursue Accretive Acquisitions to Further Supplement Our Portfolio_

Over our history, we have completed more than 50 acquisitions and developed a track record of successfully
integrating acquired companies. Acquisitions have historically been completed at attractive multiples and have
allowed us to further enhance our product portfolio. Our multi-prong approach to evaluating potential acquisitions
includes identification of (1) Solution Enhancement, (2) Solution Expansion and (3) Synergy Realization, which
allows us to be intentional and methodical throughout both the discovery and vetting processes. We focus on
opportunities that accelerate the development of important underinvested functionalities, provide cross-selling
opportunities, and rationalize costs through scale.

**Our Industry**

We view our business as having three distinct addressable markets, each of which is aligned with a specific business
unit. While these markets are distinct in nature, there is a common thread in that the environment and underlying
technology are deeply embedded and responsible for organizations’ most mission-critical functions. We expect the
AMC Acquisition to further build out our product capabilities to address all customer use cases, and we will integrate
the AMC business’s products into our existing business units. While investment in legacy systems has been stable,
companies are increasing their spend across modernization, integration, hybridization and next-generation data
applications. We are positioned to serve as a modernization partner that taps into growing budget pools focused on
digital transformation across a suite of buyers with evergreen budget pools including the CIO, Chief Data Officer,
Head of Applications and Head of Infrastructure. In aggregate, we view our current total addressable market as $24
billion, which sits within a broader $3.9 trillion digital transformation market. Our three current addressable markets
are as follows:

  - _Mainframe and Hybrid Cloud Software: Our infrastructure modernization products support customers in_
optimizing their mainframe workloads across a broad spectrum of pathways. Based on third-party market
research, we estimate the current market related to mainframe and hybrid cloud software to be approximately
$11 billion. Going forward, this market is expected to grow at approximately 4% annually. We believe we
have an approximately 4% market share of this addressable market. For most of our customers, the embedded
nature of mainframe servers and the speed, size and security requirements of the workloads being run on
them make switching away from the mainframe an expensive and difficult process. The importance of
mainframe is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of the world’s production IT workloads are
handled by mainframes. According to IBM, over $8 trillion in payments per year, and over 30 billion
transactions per day, are processed by mainframes. Mainframe criticality is driven by the need for reliability,
with many applications requiring high availability, and the complexity and vastness of the underlying code
makes mainframe integral to operations. There are a range of advantages that mainframe offers over
distributed computing including reliability, speed of computing and security. For customers who remain on
the mainframe, the increased data requirements and volumes generated by the digitalization of businesses
will lead to increasing mainframe workloads. For example, when retail bank account holders check their
account or engage in online banking, this activity results in queries to the mainframe creating additional
mainframe transaction volume. As retail banks and other institutions increase their product offerings and
continue their digital transformation initiatives, the ability to connect and interact with the mainframe will be
an important component of most IT deployments. Higher workload volume combined with the ongoing need
to operate, optimize, and modernize the mainframe should provide continued growth opportunities within
our Infrastructure Modernization business unit.


-----

We expect the AMC Acquisition to expand our product offerings in the mainframe and hybrid cloud market
with Enterprise Suite, COBOL and Mainframe ADLM, enabling further modernization of mainframe
applications and hybrid cloud infrastructure. With the largest companies in the world across every major
industry vertical continuing to leverage mainframe technology through hybrid cloud models, we expect that
hybrid infrastructure will remain the architecture of choice. By enabling core IT infrastructure to continue
living in mainframe environments while leveraging APIs that provide teams and customers with access to
cloud solutions and web and mobile applications, businesses are providing a modern experience for
employees and end-users, without taking on additional risk.

  - _Enterprise Content Management (“ECM”): Data modernization solutions enable organizations to capture,_
build, organize, manage and store enterprise documents and records. Using third-party market research, we
estimate the current market related to ECM solutions to be approximately $5 billion. Going forward, this
market is forecasted to grow at approximately 6% annually. Enterprises need to securely manage documents
and records across their organization and require software that provides tools to capture, build, organize,
manage and store documents and records as they flow through business processes. ECM modernization tools
for mainframe-based enterprises allow organizations to utilize terabytes of stored data that are typically
inaccessible and unutilized. Common applications of ECM systems for our customers involve document
generation workloads, which include invoice and statement generation and ticket issuance. More advanced
processes include document ingestion, robotic process automation and workflow management. For example,
processing a mortgage application is a complex process involving multiple steps and systems, which can be
streamlined and automated with an ECM system. ECM solutions are often embedded in core customer facing
workflows and are integrated with other core IT systems (enterprise resource planning systems, customer
relationship management systems, financial systems, etc.) that leverage other mainframe-stored content. The
critical nature and deep integration of ECM workflows should continue to drive future growth within our
Data Modernization business unit.

  - _App Development & Testing: Our application modernization solutions enable organizations to extract data_
from legacy Unix/Power Systems, modernize the experience for users and enable the usability of large scale
non-relational databases. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to
application development and testing to be approximately $8 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted
to grow by approximately 5% annually. Organizations use application modernization products to improve
application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for
legacy applications in a safe and secure way. Common uses of application modernization products include
enabling application development on top of mission-critical non-relational databases, removing complexity
from building modern apps on legacy platforms with low- or no-code solutions and supporting agile DevOps
methods across multiple legacy coding environments. Continued investment in functionality that supports
cloud and containerized app deployments, organizations improving application UI/UX and a shift to low- or
no-code development concepts should provide continued growth opportunities within our Application
Modernization business unit. The AMC business’s Host Connectivity and CORBA segments offer
complementary modernization solutions enabling Rocket to provide a more comprehensive solution to our
customers and increase our share in the application and development testing market.

(the “Euro Incremental Term Loan Facility”) under the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term
Loans (as defined herein) and (y) a U.S. dollar-denominated term loan facility (the “USD Incremental Term
Loan Facility” and, together with the Euro Incremental Term Loan Facility, the “Incremental First Lien Term
Loan Facilities” and, together with the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, the “Incremental Senior
Secured Credit Facilities”) in the form of a side car term loan facility or an incremental term loan facility under
the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans, as applicable, in a combined aggregate
principal amount of $1,000 million (reflecting U.S. dollar-equivalent for the Euro Incremental Term Loan
Facility), in each case with a syndicate of lenders, that will rank pari passu with the Existing First Lien Term
Loans and that will mature on November 28, 2028; and

 - the cash contribution of approximately $200 million in common equity directly or indirectly to the Company
or a parent entity of the Company by certain investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital along with any
additional co-investors designated by Bain Capital (including existing equityholders of the Company), the cash
proceeds of which will be further contributed to the Company (the “Equity Contribution” and, collectively with
the offering of the notes, the incurrence of the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, in each case,
the use of proceeds therefrom, the “Financing Transactions”).

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, together with borrowings under our Incremental First
Lien Term Loan Facilities, proceeds from the Equity Contribution and cash on hand, to (i) finance and consummate
the AMC Acquisition and (ii) pay transaction expenses and fees in connection with the foregoing.

In this offering memorandum, we refer to the AMC Acquisition and the Financing Transactions collectively as the
“Transactions.”

**THE OFFERING**

_The summary below describes the principal terms of the notes. Certain of the terms and conditions_
_described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The “Description of Notes” section of this_
_offering memorandum contains more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the notes._

**Issuer ..........................................................** Rocket Software, Inc.

**Notes Offered ............................................** $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % senior notes due

2028.

**Maturity Date ............................................** The notes will mature on November 28, 2028.

**Interest .......................................................** Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of      % per annum.

Interest on the notes will accrue from     , 2024 and will be payable
semi-annually in cash in arrears on      and      of each year,
commencing     , 2024.


**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory**

**Redemption ..........................................**


This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the
AMC Acquisition. If the issue date of the notes occurs prior to the
Acquisition Date, the Issuer will execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and will deposit, or cause to be deposited, an amount equal
to the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes into the Escrow
Account for the benefit of the holders of the notes pending the
consummation of the AMC Acquisition.

The release of Escrowed Property to the Issuer to consummate the AMC
Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, including the closing of the AMC Acquisition substantially
concurrently with or promptly following the release of the Escrowed
Property. The consummation of the AMC Acquisition is subject to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory conditions. As of the
date of this offering memorandum, the regulatory conditions in the
Acquisition Agreement have been satisfied. If (i) the closing of the AMC
Acquisition has not occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, (ii) we
notify the Trustee in writing prior to the Outside Date that we will not
pursue the consummation of the AMC Acquisition or (iii) the
Acquisition Agreement has been terminated prior to the Outside Date
without the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, we will be required
to redeem all of the outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, from and including the issue date of the notes, or
the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the notes,
whichever is later, to, but not including, the special mandatory
redemption date. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any
accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the notes, which is
included in the special mandatory redemption price. In the event that the
special mandatory price payable upon such special mandatory
redemption for the notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed
Property, the Issuer will be required to fund the difference between the
applicable special mandatory redemption price and the amount of the
Escrowed Property (plus certain fees and expenses) pursuant to a


-----

commitment provided by it. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**Guarantees ................................................** If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Date, then prior

to the Acquisition Date and pending the release of the Escrowed
Property, if applicable, the notes will not be guaranteed. From and after
the Acquisition Date and following the release of the Escrowed Property,
if applicable, the notes will be jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully
and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the
Guarantors.

**Security ......................................................** If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Date, then prior

to the Acquisition Date and pending the release of the Escrowed
Property, if applicable, the notes will be secured only by a first priority
security interest in the Escrow Account and Escrowed Property. From
and after the Acquisition Date and following the release of the Escrowed
Property, if applicable, the notes and related guarantees will be secured
by a first-priority lien, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens,
on all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future assets that
secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

**First Lien Intercreditor Agreement ........** We will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien

Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Notes Collateral Agent (as defined
herein), Royal Bank of Canada, acting as the administrative agent and
collateral agent under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities (other than the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility if
the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side
car term loan facility) (the “Bank Collateral Agent”) and, if the USD
Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term
loan facility, Royal Bank of Canada, acting as the administrative agent
and collateral agent under the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility (the
“Side Car Collateral Agent”). The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
will set forth the rights of, and relationship among, the Notes Collateral
Agent, the Trustee, the holders of the notes, the Bank Collateral Agent,
the Side Car Collateral Agent (if applicable) and the lenders under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the applicable representative of the
holders under any other future parity lien debt party thereto in respect of
the exercise of rights and remedies against the collateral of the Issuer and
the Guarantors. In addition, holders of the notes will waive a number of
rights otherwise accruing to secured lenders in bankruptcy. For a
description of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description
of Notes—Security for the Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Ranking .....................................................** From and after the Acquisition Date and following the release of the

Escrowed Property, if applicable, the notes and the related guarantees
will be the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and
will be secured on a _pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit_
Facilities.

The notes and the related guarantees will:

                    - be effectively senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ existing and future junior lien and unsecured senior


-----

debt, including the Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing the notes;

                    - be effectively pari passu in right of payment with the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and all future indebtedness of the Issuer secured by
a first-priority lien on the collateral securing the notes;

                    - rank equally in right of payment with any of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations under any existing and future senior
indebtedness and other obligations that are not, by their terms
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes, including
the Existing Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities;

                    - rank senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness; and

                    - be structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the notes.

On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as of
December 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had
approximately $4,634 million of total long-term debt outstanding
(including the notes offered hereby), of which $595 million would have
been unsecured indebtedness, consisting principally of the Existing
Notes, and $4,039 million would have been secured indebtedness,
consisting of the notes offered hereby and borrowings outstanding under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Company would have had
$374 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness
under its Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility (as defined
herein) (after giving effect to letters of credit issued thereunder).

**Optional Redemption ...............................** We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to    , 2025

at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date, plus a “make-whole” premium and, at any time on or after    ,
2025, at the redemption prices specified under “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption.” In addition, at any time prior to     , 2025, up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed
with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, at the redemption price
specified under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” In
addition, until     , 2025, we may redeem up to 10% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the notes during each twelve-month
period commencing from the issue date of the notes at a redemption price
of 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

**Change of Control ....................................** If we experience certain change of control triggering events, we must

offer to purchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date.

A change of control will be permitted and will not constitute a change of
control triggering event if (i) the consolidated total leverage ratio of the
Company would be no greater than 6.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis as
of the date of consummation of a permitted change of control (such date,


-----

**Mandatory** **Offer** **to** **Repurchase**
**Following Certain Asset Sales .............**


the “Permitted Change of Control Effective Date”) (tested, at the Issuer’s
option, on a pro forma basis as of the time of signing the applicable sale
transaction), (ii) the new permitted holder shall either be (a)(I) a private
equity fund, similar investment fund or sovereign wealth fund, or
consortium of private equity funds, similar investment funds or
sovereign wealth funds acting in concert that (x) (in the case of each such
fund other than a sovereign wealth fund) invests, as a substantial part of
its business, in companies that are not, at the time of investment, in
financial distress, as determined by the Issuer in good faith, and (y)
together with their affiliated funds, have committed capital and/or assets
under management in excess of $1.0 billion and (II) a special purpose
acquisition company sponsored by the person(s) described in clause
(ii)(a)(I) above and (b) a strategic or other corporate business engaged
directly or indirectly in a business reasonably related or similar to the
Company’s business; provided, that, if the new permitted holder is (a) an
entity as set forth in subclause (ii)(a) above, the Company (or any
successor thereof) shall have obtained a public corporate credit rating of
at least B3 from Moody’s and B- from S&P or (b) an entity as set forth
in subclause (ii)(b) above, the Company (or any successor thereof) shall
have obtained a public corporate credit rating of at least Ba3 from
Moody’s and BB- from S&P (in each case, after giving effect to the
change of control and all transactions related thereto). For more details,
see the section “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control
Triggering Event” and related definitions.

If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt or reinvest the
proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, we must offer to
repurchase the notes at the prices listed under “Description of Notes—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock.”


**Certain Covenants ....................................** The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that limit,

among other things, our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries
to:

                    - incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;

                    - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions
to stockholders;

                    - make investments;

                    - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

                    - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of
substantially all of our assets;

                    - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

                    - sell or transfer certain assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and
limitations. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”


-----

During any period that the notes have an investment grade rating, as
determined by two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings,
Inc. and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, and no default or event
of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing, we will
not be subject to certain of the restrictive covenants and certain
repurchases at the option of holders contained in the indenture. See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants
on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”

**Transfer Restrictions ................................** The offer and sale of the notes have not been registered under the

Securities Act and may not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. We do not intend to list the notes on
any securities exchange. See “Notice to Investors.”


**Absence of an Established Market for**

**the Notes ...............................................**


The notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently no
market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend
to make a market in the notes, the initial purchasers are not obligated to
do so, and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the
notes will develop or be maintained. See “Plan of Distribution.”


**Use of Proceeds .........................................** We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, together

with borrowings under our Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities,
proceeds from the Equity Contribution and cash on hand, to (i) finance
and consummate the AMC Acquisition and (ii) pay transaction expenses
and fees in connection with the foregoing. See “Use of Proceeds.”


**Trustee, Notes Collateral Agent and**

**Escrow Agent .......................................**


Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the notes (in such
capacity, the “Trustee”), as notes collateral agent (in such capacity, the
“Notes Collateral Agent”) and escrow agent (in such capacity, the
“Escrow Agent”).


You should refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” for an explanation of certain risks of investing in the notes.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**_Rocket_**

The following table presents Rocket’s summary historical and unaudited pro forma financial information as of and for
the periods presented. The summary historical consolidated financial information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022
and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 presented below has been derived from Rocket’s historical
audited consolidated financial statements for such periods, which are included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Rocket and the AMC business as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is derived from Rocket’s historical audited consolidated financial
statements and the AMC business’s audited historical financial combined carveout statements presented on a “carveout” basis from OpenText’s accounting records, which have been prepared specifically for the purpose of the AMC
Acquisition, with certain pro forma adjustments prepared and presented by Rocket as described under “Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as
of December 31, 2023 is presented as if the Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2023 and the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December
31, 2023 gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma
adjustments have been made on available information and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances to reflect, on a pro forma basis, the impact of the Transactions on the historical financial information.
See also the section below titled “—The AMC Business” for certain summary historical combined financial
information of the AMC business.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and related notes are provided for informational
purposes only and do not purport to represent what the combined company’s actual results of operations or financial
position would have been had the Transactions been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily
indicative of the combined company’s future results of operations or financial position for any future period. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on information and assumptions, which are
described in the accompanying notes under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” The
actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein.
Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any anticipated synergies
or dis-synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Acquisition or any integration costs
that may be incurred. The results and balances reflected herein are not intended to be a projection of future financial
position or results of operations of Rocket following the completion of the Transactions, which may vary materially
from the results reflected because of various factors.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, in particular
with respect to (a) the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures and (b) the presentation of the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information in the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information.”

You should read this summary historical and unaudited pro forma financial information together with “Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information,” “Rocket’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” “AMC Business’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements and the AMC business’s
audited combined carveout financial statements and accompanying notes thereto, in each case included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum.

(1) In addition to our results under GAAP, we also present our Non-GAAP Metrics, which are non-GAAP
financial measures and have been presented in this offering memorandum as supplemental measures of
financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We define our nonGAAP financial measures as follows:

        - Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue is revenue resulting from the annualized value of invoices for
active maintenance and term/subscription contracts (including expired contracts that have a
high probability of renewal within twelve months of the previously ended term) as of the last
day of the reporting period, plus royalty, perpetual license, professional service and other
revenue calculated on a last-twelve-month basis. Revenue is reported on a pro forma basis
(including the historical financial performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition
date for all periods presented) and excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for
deferred revenue and backlog intangible asset amortization;


-----

    - Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue is cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology
and employee stock compensation and other one-time expenses and including certain pro forma
cost of revenue adjustments.

    - Non-GAAP Gross Profit is Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue,
which is GAAP cost of revenue adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock
compensation and other, and certain pro forma adjustments (including the historical financial
performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition date for all periods presented);

    - EBITDA is net income (loss), excluding interest expense, other income (expense), employee
stock compensation expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expenses;

    - Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, on a pro forma basis (including the historical
financial performance of acquisitions prior to the applicable acquisition date for all periods
presented), adjusted for Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue, and excluding costs or income relating
to acquisitions, debt refinancing, management consulting, recruiting, employee termination and
severance, restructuring, litigation, new product design and development, and other items that
are considered non-core to business operations;

    - Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA is Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to give
effect to restructuring activities and planned synergies related to certain acquisitions, including,
as indicated, with and without, the AMC Acquisition;

    - Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin is Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA divided by
Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue;

    - Free Cash Flow is Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA less capital expenditures, inclusive of
financing lease payments; and

    - Free Cash Flow Conversion is Free Cash Flow divided by Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA.

Certain of our Non-GAAP Metrics in this section have been calculated utilizing accounting principles not
consistent with GAAP, including recognizing revenue on an ARR basis rather than in accordance with ASC
606. A primary difference between ARR and ASC 606 is the accounting for license revenue in our
subscription or term license arrangements, which is annualized and recognized over the contract term under
our ARR method, while recognized at a point in time, generally at the inception of the contract term, under
ASC 606. Our Non-GAAP Metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), revenue or
other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or
operating cash flows or as measures of liquidity.

We believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period
to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We believe
that they provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability
to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures.
We use these measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of
our competitors.

Our use of the Non-GAAP metrics varies from others in our industry. Non-GAAP Metrics have important
limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of
our results as reported under GAAP.

In addition, the “Pro Forma” information presented herein under the “Pro Forma” column for the year ended
December 31, 2023 reflects certain adjustments as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information” that were not applied to the “Pro Forma” information presented under the
“Historical” columns for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, including Pro Forma Adjusted


-----

EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA Margin and certain other
Non-GAAP Metrics. These metrics are therefore not fully comparable. Furthermore, the Non-GAAP Metrics
that include the AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not include the same pro forma
adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as
set forth in “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and represent a management
combined presentation whereby the Non-GAAP Metrics of the AMC business for the year ended December
31, 2022 were added together with the Non-GAAP Metrics of Rocket for the same year, with certain
adjustments as described below.

The following table reconciles Net income (loss) to EBITDA to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to Pro Forma
Run Rate Cash EBITDA (excluding the AMC business for historical information) and Pro Forma Run Rate
Cash EBITDA (including the AMC business); Revenue to Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue to Non-GAAP
Gross Profit; and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA (excluding the AMC business for historical
information) to Free Cash Flow:

**AMC business**

**Synergies**
Total cost of revenue ................................................................................ $     (1,884)
Research and development ....................................................................... (5,125)
Sales and marketing.................................................................................. (7,196)
General and administrative ....................................................................... (15,012)
Total Cost Structure.................................................................................. $    (29,217)

Our ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the AMC Acquisition is subject to a number of
risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the AMC
Acquisition—We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition, or those benefits
may take longer to realize than expected, and we will assume certain potential liabilities relating to the AMC
business. The combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.”

(r) Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue (for Rocket’s historical information only) by revenue type is comprised of (x)
for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $601.9 million of ARR, $155.3 million of perpetual
license revenue and $17.8 million of professional service revenue, and (y) for the year ended December 31,
2023, approximately $622.2 million of ARR, $142.1 million of perpetual license revenue and $25.4 million of
professional services revenue.

(2) Gross Retention Rate is defined as the dollar amount of the ARR defined as the normalized revenue value of
active Maintenance and/or Subscription contracts to a one-year term, less product churn, less customer churn,
downsells and price decreases divided by the ARR, that was up for renewal in that same period. Net Retention
Rate is calculated with the same numerator as gross retention and adds upsells, cross-sells and price increases,
which is then divided by the ARR that was up for renewal in that same period.

(3) Pro forma as adjusted total debt gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as described in “Use of Proceeds.”
See “Capitalization.”

**_The AMC Business_**

In light of the significance of the AMC Acquisition, this offering memorandum includes audited combined carveout
financial statements of the AMC business as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. OpenText
acquired Micro Focus on January 31, 2023. The AMC business has historically operated as part of Micro Focus or,
following acquisition thereof, OpenText and not as a standalone company. The audited combined carveout financial
statements of the AMC business included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are presented on a “carve-out” basis
from (i) Micro Focus’s accounting records for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 and (ii) OpenText’s
accounting records for the period from and after February 1, 2023, using the historical results of operations, cash
flows, assets and liabilities of the AMC business. For the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023, the audited
combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business exclude OT Connectivity. The audited combined
carveout financial statements of the AMC business include allocations of corporate expenses and shared expenses
from Micro Focus and OpenText, as applicable, and may not fully reflect what the AMC business’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows would have been had it been a standalone company during the periods presented.
As a result, the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum are not necessarily indicative of the AMC business’s future results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. The audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business were prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

You should read the following tables together with “AMC Business’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the AMC business’s audited combined carveout financial
statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) See footnote (1) under “––Rocket” above for definitions of the Non-GAAP Metrics and certain other

information about our use of non-GAAP financial measures. The Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the
AMC business were prepared by Rocket. Some of the Non-GAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business
were prepared by us based on certain financial information obtained through our financial diligence process.
The methodology for preparing such financial information is different than the methodology used by
OpenText to prepare the audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business (including
with respect to the allocation of shared costs) and such Non-GAAP Metrics should therefore not be viewed
as substitutes for the AMC business’s results as reported under GAAP. OpenText neither prepared nor
reviewed these Non-GAAP Metrics, and OpenText does not utilize any such Non-GAAP Metrics in its own
reporting with respect to the AMC business. We have not yet closed the AMC Acquisition, and the NonGAAP Metrics with respect to the AMC business are therefore subject to certain adjustments and changes
after we close the AMC Acquisition and integrate the AMC business into our own business.

The following table reconciles Net income to EBITDA to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to Pro Forma Run
Rate Cash EBITDA; Revenue to Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue to Non-GAAP Gross Profit; and Pro Forma

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and_
_all of the information included in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to purchase the notes. Any of_
_the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._
_The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect_
_our business, results of operations and financial condition. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your original_
_investment. The risks discussed below also include forward–looking statements, and our actual results may differ_
_substantially from those discussed in these forward–looking statements. See “Forward–looking Statements” in this_
_offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to our Business**

**_We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a long-term strategic partnership with IBM and loss of_**
**_significant revenue from this partnership would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations and prospects._**

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a long-term strategic partnership with IBM. For the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the pro forma combined fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we generated
approximately 38%, 35% and 23%, respectively, of our total Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue from this partnership. No
other customer or partner accounted for more than 3% of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022.

We are a party to a master licensed works agreement (the “MLWA”) with IBM to develop and update mission-critical
software products for IBM’s core platforms. IBM is not obligated under the MLWA to issue new statements of work
or work orders to us, nor is IBM required to spend a minimum amount with us in any period. As a result, there can be
no assurance that the volume of work to be performed by us under the MLWA and the revenue we generate therefrom
will not vary significantly from year to year, which could in turn cause our revenue to vary significantly from year to
year and could potentially decrease in the future by material amounts. We may experience loss or reduction of business
under the MLWA for any reason, including the royalties received for and quality of the products and services we
provide. In addition, IBM has its own policies and guidelines that control its promotion and distribution practices and,
pursuant to the terms of the MLWA, has the ability to change unilaterally how they promote and/or distribute the
products we build for them. Accordingly, IBM may reduce prices to its end users, which would reduce the
corresponding royalties to us. IBM may also demand increased quality standards or, under certain circumstances,
transfer some or all of the work and services we currently provide in-house or to our current or future competitors.
Alternatively, unexpected adverse events affecting the financial condition or business strategy of IBM could result in
a reduction or delay in work orders from or a delay or default in payment by IBM. Our future growth will depend in
part on IBM’s ability to market and sell our products and services and the loss of significant revenue under this
partnership would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_If customers do not renew their contracts with us, our revenue will decline, and our business and financial_**
**_condition may be adversely affected._**

Renewals of existing maintenance contracts and subscriptions are handled primarily by our centralized renewal team,
who have helped to drive our consistently high gross and net retention rates, which have averaged 92% and 102%,
respectively, since 2020. However, these retention rates may decline or fluctuate in the future. In order for us to
maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their maintenance contracts
and subscriptions when existing terms expire. Our customers have no obligation to renew after the expiration of their
contractual period and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew.

Our direct sales force for our Rocket-branded products develops relationships directly with our customers. Our
enterprise sales professionals focus on building long term relationships with key customers, minimizing cancellations
and maximizing renewal revenue, while our product specialists identify new opportunities for additional capacity.


-----

**_If we are unable to attract new customers or convert our single-product customers into multi-product customers in_**
**_a manner that is cost-effective, our growth could be slower than we expect, and our business may be harmed._**

Demand for our products is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued
market acceptance of our products, the timing of development and release of new features and functions, technological
change, growth or contraction in our addressable market, operating systems and applications and macroeconomic
changes on the demand for technology solutions like ours. In addition, if competitors introduce lower cost or
differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with our features, our ability to sell our features based
on factors such as pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract
new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could negatively
affect the growth of our revenue. Even if we do attract customers, the cost of new customer acquisition may prove so
high as to prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability.

Our sales efforts typically involve educating our prospective customers about the uses, benefits and value proposition
of the systems and applications that our products support. Customers often view these commitments as significant
strategic decisions and, as a result, may require time to evaluate, test and qualify our solutions prior to entering into
or expanding a relationship with us or acquiring new products from our portfolio. We spend substantial time and
resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. The failure of our efforts to
secure sales after investing resources in a sales process could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, the increased complexity and expansion of our customers’ IT infrastructures have driven additional
usage of our installed solutions and provided opportunities to sell additional products from our portfolio and has
caused us to invest in sales efforts focused on cross-selling and upselling existing customers. If our upsell and crosssell efforts do not result in additional revenue, we may not experience growth and our business, results of operations
and financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_We may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts_**
**_could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and_**
**_competitive position._**

We have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to streamline our
organization and strengthen our talent and culture, while supporting our revenue growth, margin improvement and
productivity. If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective,
we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained
or not realized and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected. These initiatives, or
our failure to successfully manage them, could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs, including
distraction of our management and employees, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced
employee productivity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market_**
**_developments, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed._**

We need to continue to provide critical functionality as customers’ IT innovation evolves. The markets in which we
compete have evolved rapidly, and the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as hybrid cloud, open source,
mobile, workflow, consumer product-like user experiences, social, collaboration, machine learning, AI, internet
connected devices, robotic automation, security, cryptography, development tools and other digital technologies
increasingly become the basis for customer purchases. At the same time, our customers and prospective customers are
facing their own competitive imperatives to adopt digital technologies, resulting in the ongoing disruption of almost
every sector of the global economy.

Accordingly, to compete effectively in our rapidly changing markets, we must:

    - identify and invest in the right emerging technologies and select them from the many technologies in
which we could make investments;


-----

    - accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs;

    - successfully deliver new platform technologies and products that meet these business needs;

    - efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments;

    - profitably market and sell new products in markets where our sales and marketing teams have less
experience; and

    - effectively deliver, either directly or through our ecosystem of partners, the business process planning,
IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services that our customers require to be
successful.

Further, as new technologies (such as AI) continue to emerge, they may be disruptive to our industry as a whole. These
technologies could result in new and innovative products and solutions that could increase competition, place us at a
competitive disadvantage or even render our technology, products and solutions obsolete. As the adoption of AI
quickens, we expect competition to intensify, and additional companies may enter our markets offering similar
products, systems or solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors and our strategy to
integrate AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems or solutions may also not be accepted
by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace.

If we fail to meet any of these requirements or develop these technologies or our competitors or other third parties
respond to such challenges more quickly or successfully than us, the demand for our solutions and services may
diminish and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Disruptions of, discovery of errors in or risks related to our software solutions could adversely affect our financial_**
**_condition._**

The software solutions we offer are inherently complex. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that
errors will not be found in current versions, new versions or enhancements of our solutions after commencement of
commercial delivery. If new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant
amounts of customer support, our operating margins could be harmed. In addition, any disruptions, discovery of errors,
risks related to our software solutions or other performance problems could significantly harm their and our reputations
and businesses. With our current solutions strategy, these risks increase because we are combining already complex
products to create solutions that are even more complicated than the aggregation of their product components.
Significant technical challenges could also arise with our solutions, because our customers purchase and deploy our
products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third-party software applications
and databases. These combinations increase our risk, with respect to our customers, because, in the event of a systemwide failure, it may be difficult for the customer to determine which product is at fault; thus, we may be blamed for
the failure of another supplier’s products.

As a result of the foregoing, we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share, loss of
customers, damage to our reputation, an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, higher development and
testing and support costs, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and support resources,
increased service and warranty costs, litigation and increased insurance costs.

**_Cyber-attacks on our networks and actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could_**
**_have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations._**

Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of cyber-attacks on their systems and networks on an ongoing
basis. In the course of our regular business operations, we process and transmit personal information, proprietary
information, confidential information and other sensitive or regulated data, including personal information of
employees, customers and others. Computer programmers, hackers and other third parties may be able to penetrate
our network security and misappropriate, copy or pirate the information and data we collect (including that of third
parties), create system disruptions or cause interruptions or shutdowns of our internal systems and services. A number
of websites have been subject to denial of service attacks, where a website is bombarded with information requests


-----

eventually causing the website to overload, resulting in a delay or disruption of service. Also, in recent years, there
has been a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against
corporate networks to breach their security for malicious purposes. These attacks may be committed by company
employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to
address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. If
successful, any of these events could damage our computer systems and equipment or those of our third-party hosting
vendors or customers. Furthermore, these attacks could disrupt or prevent us from providing timely maintenance,
support and services to our customers and result in the theft or misappropriation of proprietary, personally identifiable,
confidential and other sensitive or regulated information and data of ours, our employees, our customers and our
business partners and materially disrupt business for us, our customers and our business partners.

Computer programmers, hackers and other third parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and
other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our
products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software
programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in
interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and may impede our sales and
other critical functions. Security risks for us will also increase as we continue to grow our offerings and services,
especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data. Additionally, our customers may not effectively
implement all of the updated security features that we introduce or make all necessary changes to their operating
procedures, or they may fail to implement other required security measures.

We have outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party vendors and our business operations also
depend, in part, on the success of these third parties’ own cyber security measures. Additionally, we depend upon our
employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in a safe and secure manner that does
not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Due to our remote first work environment,
there is an increased risk that we may experience cybersecurity-related incidents as a result of our employees, service
providers and other third parties working remotely on less secure systems and environments. Our efforts to protect
our data, that of our customers or the information we receive from other third parties may also be unsuccessful due to
software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee, contractor or vendor error or malfeasance, government
surveillance or other threats that evolve. Because the techniques used by such individuals or entities to access, disrupt
or sabotage devices, systems and networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a
target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and we may not become aware in a timely manner of such a
security breach, which could exacerbate any damage we experience.

Affected users (including customers or third parties) or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions
against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosures of data, which could cause us to incur
significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. A
successful cyber-attack could also negatively impact the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and
harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new customers. Any of these events could have a material
and adverse effect on our reputation, business or financial results.

Recent legislation has increased the responsibilities of software companies and their clients regarding financial
security, identity theft and privacy. Subsequent changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could also impact
how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our products, services or features, or our
ability to develop new products, services or features.

**_Our business and products are dependent on the availability, integrity and security of IT systems and the continuity_**
**_of our business processes._**

Our IT systems and related software applications are integral to our business. We rely on controls and systems to
ensure data integrity of critical business information and proper operation of our systems and networks. Despite
network security, disaster recovery and systems management measures in place, our disaster recovery planning may
not be sufficient for all situations, and we may encounter unexpected general systems outages or failures that may
affect our ability to conduct research and development, provide maintenance and support of our products, manage our
contractual arrangements, accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record our transactions, provide
critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements. Additionally, these unexpected systems


-----

outages or failures may require additional personnel and financial resources, disrupt our business or cause delays in
the reporting of our financial results. We may also be required to modify, enhance, upgrade or implement new systems,
procedures and controls to ensure the continuity of our business processes or to reflect changes in our business or
technological advancements, which could cause us to incur additional costs and require additional management
attention, placing burdens on our internal resources.

Lack of data integrity could create inaccuracies and hinder our ability to perform meaningful business analysis and
make informed business decisions. If our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable, or if we, or any of the thirdparty service providers we engage, were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively, we
could experience operational disruptions that cause us to have disputes with or lose existing customers, have difficulty
preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, experience regulatory sanctions, penalties or other legal problems, incur
increased operating and administrative expenses, lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of
intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Delays in modifying, enhancing, upgrading or implementing our IT systems could limit the success or result in the
failure of those initiatives and impair the effectiveness of our business processes and internal controls. We also
outsource certain IT-related functions to third parties that are responsible for maintaining their own network security,
disaster recovery and systems management procedures. If we, or our third-party IT vendors, fail to manage our
respective IT systems and related software applications effectively, it could adversely affect our business operations,
results of operations and cash flows. Failure to adequately address these issues, as well as to manage and protect our
infrastructure, could result in the diversion of management’s attention and resources and adversely affect our ability
to manage our business and to meet our obligations to our customers.

**_Our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees and other key personnel._**

To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified employees while controlling
related labor costs. Experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is
intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future,
including, in particular, those employed by companies we acquire. Additionally, as we are a remote first work
environment, there is a risk that the quality of work and productivity of employees, especially new employees who
joined in a remote or hybrid work environment, could be difficult to maintain at a consistent and high level. Changing
demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire.
Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In
addition, acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or our personnel.

In addition, our business results depend largely on our chief executive officer and senior management team as well as
our product, sales, marketing and services personnel and their experience, knowledge of market dynamics and
specifications and long-standing customer relationships. We customarily retain key personnel of companies we
acquire in order to maintain key customer relationships and manage the transition of the acquired business unit. Our
inability to retain or hire qualified managers or individual contributors at reasonable compensation levels would
restrict our ability to successfully operate and grow our business.

**_Future product development is dependent upon access to and reliability of third-party products._**

We use components developed and maintained by third-party vendors in some of our software products. We expect
that we may have to incorporate software from third-party vendors in our future products. We may not be able to
replace the functionality provided by the third-party software currently offered with our products if that software
becomes obsolete, defective, non-compliant with third-party patent restrictions or incompatible with future versions
of our products. Furthermore, we have limited control over third-party operations and our products may be negatively
impacted if a third-party vendor does not adequately develop, maintain or update their software, or if our relationship
with a third-party vendor is terminated. Undetected vulnerabilities in third-party products may also expose our
platform to data breaches and cybersecurity attacks.


-----

Any significant interruption in the availability of these third-party products on commercially acceptable terms, defects
in these products, non-compliance with third-party patent restrictions or our inability to comply with the licensing
terms of either third-party commercial software could delay development of future products or enhancement of
existing products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_The use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and adversely affect our_**
**_ability to offer our products._**

We incorporate open source software in some of our products and anticipate the continued use of open source
components in the future. We must carefully monitor and manage our use of open source software and our compliance
with their open source licensing requirements. Certain open source licenses may require us to offer our products that
incorporate the open source software for no cost, make publicly available our source code for derivative works we
create based upon incorporating the open source software or license such derivative works under the terms of the
particular open source license.

The use of third-party open source software may also expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial
software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin
of the software. Use of open source software can potentially heighten security risks due to its public accessibility,
which may facilitate third-party efforts in identifying means to compromise our products. Any of the foregoing could
be harmful to our business, financial condition or operating results.

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully._**

Our market is highly competitive, with many companies providing solutions competitive to our software platform.
Well-known and established competitors include BMC Software, Fortra and Broadcom. Additional strong competitors
may emerge in the future from time to time.

Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more personnel, financial, technical, marketing and
other resources than we possess, and accordingly may be able to devote substantially greater resources than us to
development, marketing, sales and support of their products and services.

Software solutions and demands in our industry often change significantly, and our future success will depend
materially on our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes. If we cannot adjust, develop and compete
effectively with changing software solutions and products as and when they are introduced in our industry, our ability
to generate meaningful revenues or maintain the profitability of our operations would be impaired substantially.

Our current and potential competitors may develop and offer new software technologies that render our products less
competitive, unmarketable or even obsolete. In addition, if any competitors develop products with similar or better
functionality than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our products to remain competitive, which
could result in a material reduction in our margins and a corresponding material negative effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. We may not be able to address and satisfactorily solve the many competitive
pressures and challenges facing us in our industry, and our failure to do so would substantially harm our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We must continue to invest in adequate research and development resources._**

Both traditional and new competitors are investing heavily in the market in which we operate and competing for
customers. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new products and enhancements to our
existing products in order to maintain or expand our market position, including investing in AI capabilities. We expect
to continue to incur significant expenditures for development of our solutions, which may not ultimately grow our
business or cause long-term profitability.

Maintaining adequate research and development resources to meet the demands of the market is essential, and our
failure to do so could present an advantage to our competitors. If we are unable to develop products due to certain


-----

constraints, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of liquidity or other development
resources, including through third-party outsourcing firms, our competitiveness could be harmed.

**_Damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business._**

Our brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, and any such negative impacts may
harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our reputation is potentially susceptible to damage
from events such as significant disputes with customers, alleged or actual product defects, internal control deficiencies,
delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or
former customers, directors, employees, competitors, vendors or partners. If our brand image is tarnished by negative
perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted, which in turn
may negatively impact our business as a whole.

**_Our financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict and our business is affected by seasonality._**

Our revenues and profitability are affected by factors such as the introduction of new products and services, our ability
to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of our sales cycles and the seasonality of
technology purchases. In addition, certain of our growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving
competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results.
Our financial results may also be impacted by the structure of our products and services contracts and the nature of
our customers’ businesses; for example, certain of our services contracts with commercial customers in regulated
industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general
economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact our financial results
in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, our financial results are difficult to predict.
Historically, we have experienced seasonality, in that we have had had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the
immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each
quarter by our customers, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult
to predict.

**_We may not meet our growth and productivity objectives._**

On an ongoing basis, we seek to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously
transforming our business with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while
also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model
across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in
speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact our competitiveness and ability to
meet our growth and productivity objectives.

**_If the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our target market are inaccurate, our future growth_**
**_rate may be impacted, and our business would be harmed._**

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions
and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this offering memorandum relating to
the size and expected growth of the markets for our products and services may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the
markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar
rates, if at all. Further, we may suffer as a result of inaccuracies in such determinations as they relate to potential
acquisition targets or other strategic partners. For example, our expectations with respect to the synergies and growth
possibilities following acquisitions may be significantly impacted if our estimates and assumptions are materially
inaccurate.

The principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include the size and expected growth rate of the global
markets for our products, as well as a variety of adjacent enterprise and infrastructure software markets. Our market
opportunity is also based on the assumption that the strategic approach that our software solutions enable for our
potential customers will be more attractive to our customers than that offered by our competitors.


-----

Historically, our investment in new products has expanded our market opportunity into areas of growing strategic
importance, and we continue to introduce new products to increase our addressable market. However, if these
assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
For more information regarding our estimates of market opportunity and the forecasts of market growth included in
this offering circular, see “Business—Our Industry.”

**_Failure to appropriately price our products and services could materially adversely affect our business._**

Many of our existing customers do not have contractual obligations to purchase additional solutions. Customer
renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction
with our solutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the
solutions offered by our competitors, any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at
all. If we do not appropriately price our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could suffer.

**_Failure to effectively support older versions of our products and services and manage our products and services_**
**_lifecycles could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business._**

Because the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances, we frequently introduce new
products with greater ease-of-use, improved performance or additional features and functionality. We believe we have
a reputation for maintaining products for years, which leads to additional headcount and expense supporting older
products that are not used by many existing customers or gaining new customers. We expect that, as we continue to
improve and enhance our software solutions, this backward compatibility will no longer be practical or cost-effective,
and we may decrease or discontinue service for our older products. To the extent we no longer provide extensive
backward capability for our products, we may damage our relationship with our existing customers, which could
decrease sales, generate legal claims and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks associated with our indirect distribution channels._**

A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products and services through indirect distribution channels
such as resellers, systems integrators and strategic partners. Conducting business through indirect distribution channels
presents a number of risks, including:

    - our indirect channel partners typically can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no
notice and with little or no penalty;

    - we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional indirect channel partners if we lose any of
our existing ones;

    - our existing indirect channel partners may not be able to effectively sell new products and services that
we may introduce;

    - we do not have direct control over the business practices, compliance programs and processes or risk
management policies adopted by our indirect channel partners, and they may engage in inappropriate
practices without our knowledge, which could result in penalties and/or reputational damage to us;

    - our indirect channel partners may not be able to deliver the same quality or standard of services that we
do, which may require us to engage with their customers at a direct cost to us to protect our products and
services standards and reputation;

    - our indirect channel partners may also offer competitive products and services through acquisition or
internal development and as such, may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as
compared to our competitors’ products;


-----

    - we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing
activities;

    - our indirect channel partners may experience financial difficulties that may impact their ability to market
our products and may lead to delays, or even default, in their payment obligations to us; and

    - we also depend on some of our indirect channel partners for accurate and timely reporting of our channel
sales; any disruption, delay or under-reporting by our indirect channel partners could have an adverse
effect on our bookings, revenues and cash flows.

**_Our products must remain compatible with ever-changing operating and database environments._**

Some new products modified or introduced by operating and database system developers could incorporate features
that perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products
to maintain compatibility with these companies’ software. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our
products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system
software developers.

Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to changes in operating and database systems, or any product quality
and performance issues with the underlying databases or operating systems resulting in degradation of our products’
quality and performance, could influence customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with
comparable functionality offered by competitors, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operation or financial condition.

**_AI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions,_**
**_which could present risks and challenges to our business._**

AI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions and
could be a significant factor in future offerings. While AI can present significant benefits, it can also present risks and
challenges to our business. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into decisionmaking algorithms, security challenges and the protection of personal privacy could impair the adoption and
acceptance of AI. If the output from AI in our products, systems or solutions are deemed to be inaccurate or
questionable, or if the use of AI does not operate as anticipated or perform as promised, our business and reputation
may be harmed.

The integration of AI may also expose us to risks regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights,
particularly if any copyrighted material is embedded in training models. The use of copyrighted materials in AI and
other machine learning technology has not been fully interpreted by federal, state, or international courts and the
regulatory framework for AI continues to evolve and remains uncertain. It is possible that new laws and regulations
will be adopted in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new
ways, that would affect the way in which AI and other machine learning technology is used in our products, systems
or solutions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, including court decisions, could be significant.
The risks and challenges associated with integrating AI and other machine learning technology into our products,
systems and solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Economic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition, including our revenue growth and profitability._**

Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage
in forecasting. These include: general economic and business conditions; the overall demand for software and services;
governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and general political developments.

Our single largest customer is a government entity, and our sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties
and governmental regulations. Our contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S.
government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at
the discretion of the government.


-----

Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a government contract could adversely affect our
revenue. Additionally, our government contracts are generally subject to certain requirements, some of which are
generally not present in commercial contracts and/or may be complex. They may also be subject to audits and
investigations. Failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties,
and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Macroeconomic developments such as inflation and higher interest rate in the U.S. or elsewhere and potential
economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or other countries could negatively affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global
economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce
their IT budgets or be unable to fund software and services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease
or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously
purchased products and services. We believe that bookings and revenues tied to new business and professional services
could be particularly vulnerable in situations where we see customers broadly tightening IT budgets.

In addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, including the war between Israel and Hamas, terrorist
attacks around the globe and the war between Russia and the Ukraine and the potential for other hostilities in various
parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic
and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our
revenue growth and profitability.

**_Third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe their intellectual property rights, exposing_**
**_us to litigation that, regardless of merit, may be costly to defend._**

Our success and ability to compete are also dependent upon our ability to operate without infringing or otherwise
violating the proprietary rights of others. Claims of patent and copyright infringement are common in the software
industry. Third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe or otherwise violate their
intellectual property rights. Any such claim, with or without merit, could have a significant effect on our business and
financial results. In addition, parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief
affecting our ability to market and license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property. Former
employers of our employees may also assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the
confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Future litigation may also involve non-practicing
entities or other intellectual property owners who have no relevant product offerings and against whom our own
intellectual property may therefore provide little or no deterrence.

Defending against any third-party claim could be time consuming, divert management’s attention from our business
operations and result in adverse judgments, settlements on unfavorable terms or substantial litigation costs, including
any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations that may result from such claims. As a result of such
claims, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties or develop alternative technology or redesign our
products. We cannot be sure that any such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If a successful
claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology (or must spend significant
amounts to do so), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely
affected.

**_If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies,_**
**_we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably._**

Our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. We
rely, inter alia, on trademark, trade secret, copyright and patent protection, as well as a combination of non-disclosure,
confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology, products and rights therein. However,
these legal protections afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or
maintain any competitive advantage.


-----

In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in
our pending patent applications and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not
provide us with significant commercial protection or may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could
also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the USPTO. Our issued and licensed patents and those that may be
issued or licensed in the future may expire or may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our
ability to stop competitors from marketing technologies related or similar to ours. Additionally, upon expiration of
our issued or licensed patents, we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making, using, selling or
importing products using the technology based on the expired patents. Finally, we may not have appropriately invested
in growing our patent portfolio or in the right technologies.

We also must rely on contractual provisions with the third parties that license technology to us and that obligate these
third parties to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us. There is no guarantee that these third parties would
be successful in attempting to protect our rights in any such licensed technology. There is no assurance that competitors
will not be able to design around our patents or other intellectual property or any intellectual property or technology
licensed to us.

We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our
rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent
technology or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We seek to protect our know-how and
other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and/or intellectual property assignment
agreements with our employees, consultants, partners and customers. However, such agreements may not be
enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized
use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently
develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information.

In addition, we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of
our products. Although registration is not a requirement for trademark protection under U.S. law, obtaining a federal
registration of a trademark provides significant advantages, for example with respect to the enforcement of trademark
rights, as well as procedural advantages. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the
laws of the U.S. If we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our
competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive
position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Due to our operations in non-U.S. markets, we are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our business,_**
**_results of operations or financial condition._**

We generate revenue in markets outside the United States. The risks inherent in global operations include:

    - lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign laws and legal standards, including
employment laws and privacy laws, which may vary widely across the countries in which we sell our
products;

    - increased expenses to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign corporations, including the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”);

    - compliance with, and potentially adverse tax consequences of, foreign tax regimes;

    - fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency exchange controls, price controls and limitations on
repatriation of earnings;

    - local economic conditions;

    - increased expense related to localization of products and development of foreign language marketing
and sales materials;

    - longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in foreign
countries;

    - increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;

    - restrictive employment regulations;

    - difficulties and increased expense in implementing corporate policies and controls;

    - international intellectual property laws, which may be more restrictive or may offer lower levels of
protection than U.S. law;

    - compliance with differing and changing local laws and regulations in multiple international locations,
including regional data privacy laws, as well as compliance with U.S. laws and regulations where
applicable in these international locations;

    - political unrest, war (including the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war),
terrorism or pandemics, particularly in areas in which we have employees and facilities;

    - potential vulnerability to computer system, internet or other systemic attacks, such as denial of service,
viruses or other malware, any of which may be caused by criminals, terrorists or other sophisticated
organizations;

    - workforce challenges from cultural, language and time zone differences; and

    - limitations in our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.

The unique risks of operating in a particular country may require us to adopt a different business approach or strategy
in that particular country, which could increase our cost of doing business or limit the type of business activities we
can perform in such country. In addition, if we suffer a business disruption due to any of the risks listed above and do
not have in place or are not able to implement adequate response plans, our ability to support customers and maintain
normal business operations for a significant length of time could be hindered such that our competitive position could
be significantly impacted. Furthermore, our financial condition could be adversely impacted if our costs to recover
escalate due to such recovery occurring over a protracted period.

If we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding our
international business, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial
condition. Further, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial
resources. Due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, international
acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not
attendant to acquisitions made within the United States. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional
resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue
or profitability.

**_We are subject to risks related to our business combinations._**

As part of our overall strategy, we have acquired, and intend to continue to acquire or invest in, complementary
companies, products and technologies, such as ASG Technologies and the AMC business. Our ability to realize the
benefits we anticipate from our mergers and acquisitions activities, including anticipated cost savings, may be
adversely impacted by the following:

    - we may not retain and integrate key technical, sales and managerial personnel;


-----

    - we may not assimilate the personnel, culture and operations of the combined companies, including backoffice functions and systems, such as accounting, human resources and others;

    - we may suffer unanticipated expenses or not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products
with our current products and technologies;

    - our ongoing business could be disrupted, including management being distracted from other objectives,
opportunities and risks;

    - we may not achieve the expected benefits or maximize our financial and strategic position through the
successful integration of acquired businesses;

    - our policies, procedures and controls may not be applied to the acquired entity in a timely manner
following the acquisition;

    - relationships with the acquired entity’s customers, partners or vendors might degrade, creating
challenges for us to meet the objectives of the acquisition;

    - potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired entity’s customers;

    - our pre-acquisition due diligence may fail to identify technology issues, such as problems with software
code, architecture or functionality, intellectual property ownership issues, employment or management
issues, customer or partner issues, errors or irregularities in the accounting or financial reporting of the
target, unknown liabilities of the target, legal contingencies, compliance failures or other issues;

    - revenue from acquired companies, products and technologies may not meet our expectations;

    - the financial statements of acquired companies are not independently verified by us and we, therefore,
cannot guarantee their accuracy;

    - our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash;

    - potential adverse tax consequences;

    - in the case of foreign acquisitions, we may encounter challenges associated with lingering operations
across different cultures and languages and may experience currency and regulatory risks associated
with specific countries; and

    - our chosen strategy leading to the acquisition may not be the appropriate strategy or our resources may
be better utilized developing technology via internal product development.

In order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies, either the products of these acquired
entities must be integrated with our existing products, the customers of these acquired entities must be integrated with
our sales strategies, or both. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable. The difficulties are compounded
when the products involved are well-established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products
must be preserved. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams.
This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical
decisions and product roadmaps. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration
efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits and cost savings of our mergers and acquisitions activities. For
additional information regarding risks related to the AMC Acquisition, see “—Risks Related to the AMC
Acquisition.”

**_Our business is affected by general business, financial market and economic conditions, which could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations._**

The markets in which we operate are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and
worldwide, including availability of credit, interest rates, fluctuations in capital, credit and mortgage markets and


-----

business and consumer confidence. Adverse developments in global financial markets and general business and
economic conditions, including through recession, downturn or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability and the ability of our customers
and suppliers to access capital.

**_Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and if we fail to raise capital when needed in the future,_**
**_we could be prevented from growing or could be forced to delay or eliminate product development efforts or other_**
**_operations._**

We may need to raise additional funds to invest in growth opportunities, to continue product development and sales
and marketing efforts, and for other purposes. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.
If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations, invest in future
growth opportunities, or continue operations at anticipated levels, which could harm our business and results of
operations. In addition, current and future debt instruments may impose restrictions on our ability to dispose of
property, make changes in our business, engage in mergers or acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness and make
investments and distributions.

**_Bain Capital controls us, and Bain Capital’s interests may conflict with us or the holder of the notes in the future._**

Bain Capital has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction, regardless of whether the holders
of notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Bain Capital could cause us to
make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets,
which may impair our ability to make payments under the notes. In addition, to the extent permitted by the indenture
that will govern the notes, the credit agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form
of a side car term loan facility) credit agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the indenture that governs our Existing Notes, Bain Capital may cause us to pay dividends rather than
make capital expenditures or otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business.

In addition, Bain Capital is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire
and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Bain Capital may vote in a manner so as
to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business, which may be related to the
current or future operations of these investments. Also, Bain Capital may pursue acquisitions that may be
complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long
as Bain Capital continues to own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than 50%, Bain Capital
will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_Litigation, legal proceedings and regulatory actions could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our_**
**_reputation._**

We are occasionally party to various litigation claims, legal proceedings and regulatory actions in the ordinary course
of business. We evaluate litigation claims, legal proceedings and regulatory actions to assess the likelihood of
unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and
estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims, legal proceedings or regulatory actions,
as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to us at the time and involve
a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned
by our current assessments and estimates.

In addition, we have business operations in high-risk legal compliance markets. Our policies and procedures require
strict compliance with all U.S. and international laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including
those regarding export controls of encryption technology and prohibiting improper payments to government officials.
Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always ensure full compliance with all
applicable legal requirements. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation or other legal or
regulatory action, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.


-----

**_Contractual disputes with our customers could be costly, time-consuming and harm our reputation._**

Our business is contract intensive and we are party to contracts with our customers all over the world. Our contracts
can contain a variety of terms, including license rights, service levels, security obligations, indemnification and
regulatory requirements. Contract terms may not always be standardized across our customers and can be subject to
differing interpretations, which could result in disputes with our customers from time to time. If our customers notify
us of an alleged contract breach or otherwise dispute any provision under our contracts, the resolution of such disputes
in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect our results of operations.

A portion of our revenue comes from identifying customers that are out of compliance with our license rights and
enforcing such rights. We face challenges in enforcing those rights while maintaining strong customer relationships.

Additionally, if customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from
the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. The risk
of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our
customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those
amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash
flow.

**_Failure to comply with federal, state and international laws relating to privacy and data protection may materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

There are numerous laws and regulations which we may be subject to regarding privacy and the collection, storage,
sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of personal data or personally identifiable information, the
scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between states or between
countries.

Compliance with such laws and regulations may require adhering to stringent legal and operational obligations and
therefore the dedication of substantial time and financial resources which may increase over time. Failure to comply
with such laws and regulations may lead to fines, other enforcement action or reputational damage. For example,
failure to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/ 679) (“GDPR”) or the UK
implementation of the GDPR, could, in the worst case, attract regulatory penalties of up to the greater of: (i) €20
million or £17.5 million (as applicable); or (ii) 4% of the entire group’s annual worldwide turnover, as well as the
possibility of enforcement actions (such as the suspension of processing activities and audits), and liabilities from
third-party claims. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) went into effect on January
1, 2020, and generally applies to businesses that collect personal information about California consumers and meet
certain thresholds with respect to revenue or buying and/or selling consumers’ personal information. If unauthorized
access, theft or disclosure of a consumer’s personal information occurs, and the business did not maintain reasonable
security practices, consumers could file a civil action (including a class action) without having to prove actual
damages, including (i) statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages,
whichever is greater, and (ii) civil penalties imposed by the Attorney General ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per
violation. Further, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”) to amend and extend
the protections of the CCPA, likely leading to greater levels of enforcement and greater costs related to compliance
with the CCPA and CPRA.

The effects of these and other evolving data privacy laws may impose potential liabilities, operational and legal
obligations, and require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliancerelated costs and expenses. Such laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus increasing costs,
operational and legal burdens and the potential for significant liability for us.

Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that
we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident. We or our third-party service
providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our thirdparty service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or
regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations or
financial condition.


-----

**_Failure to comply with export control, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject_**
**_us to penalties and other adverse consequences._**

We are subject to export controls relating to encryption in some of our products, as well as the FCPA, the UK Bribery
Act of 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both
domestic and abroad.

While we generally use commercially available or open source encryption components in some of our products, we
still need to ensure that such products are not exported to embargoed countries or denied parties.

Anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are
interpreted broadly and generally prohibit companies and their directors, officers, employees and agents from
promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in
the private sector. Such laws apply to our agents/third parties, and we leverage third parties, including channel partners,
to distribute our products or to incorporate them into their own offerings. We and our third-party intermediaries may
have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated
entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and
intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly
authorize such activities.

While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our
employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be
ultimately held responsible. Any violation of export controls, the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anticorruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage,
investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, a significant diversion of management’s
resources and attention or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and prospects.

**_Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property_**
**_infringement and other losses._**

Our agreements with customers and other third parties typically include provisions under which we agree to indemnify
or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of claims of intellectual property
infringement or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products or services or other acts or omissions. Large
indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breaches could harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may
still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have
adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand
for our services and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We face exposure to foreign currency exchange rates._**

We conduct significant transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in the value of
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect our revenues and results of operations. Our foreign
currency exchange rate exposures may adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flows.

**_Future changes in the regulations and laws of the U.S., or those of the international markets in which we do_**
**_business, could harm our business._**

As described above, we are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws
specifically governing the internet and software, in the U.S. as well as the international markets in which we do
business. These regulations and laws may cover employment, taxation, privacy, data security, data protection, the use
of AI, pricing, content, copyrights and other intellectual property, mobile communications, electronic contracts and
other communications, consumer protection, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation
of websites, and the characteristics and quality of software and services. It is possible changes to these regulations and


-----

laws, as well as compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing sets of
applicable regulations and laws, may impact our sales, operations and future growth.

**_Changes in tax law, changes in our effective tax rate or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect_**
**_our profitability and financial condition._**

The taxing jurisdictions we are subject to or operate under may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws
or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results
of operations. Many countries have recently introduced or enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax
obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our
business.

We carry out our business operations through entities in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. As such, we are
required to file corporate income tax returns that are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax laws. Our
U.S. federal, state and local and foreign tax liabilities are determined, in part, by the amount of operating profit
generated in these different taxing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate, earnings and operating cash flows could be
adversely affected by changes in the mix of operating profits generated in countries with higher statutory tax rates as
well as by the positioning of our cash balances globally. Similarly, if statutory tax rates or tax bases were to increase
or if changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were made that impact us directly, our effective tax rate,
earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of
our deferred tax assets. This evaluation requires that our management assess the positive and negative evidence
regarding sources of future taxable income. If management’s assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred
tax assets changes, we will be required to increase our valuation allowance, which will negatively impact our effective
tax rate and earnings. We are also subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions. Our
provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the
examination of our corporate tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions. The amounts ultimately paid upon
resolution of these examinations could be materially different from the amounts included in the provision for income
taxes and result in additional tax expense and operating cash outflows.

**_Ineffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results._**

Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of IT systems, the circumvention or
overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in
their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial
reporting obligations.

**Risks Related to the AMC Acquisition**

**_We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to_**
**_realize than expected, and we will assume certain potential liabilities relating to the AMC business. The combined_**
**_company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses._**

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the AMC Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to
successfully integrate the AMC business into our business. The integration of a business is a complex, costly and timeconsuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to
integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of the AMC business. The
integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of
the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the acquired
business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could adversely impact the carrying value of the
acquisition premium or goodwill, could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities,
and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the overall
integration of the AMC business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers


-----

and diversion of the attention of our management and employees. The challenges of integrating the operations of
acquired businesses include, among others:

    - difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects
from the combination;

    - difficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems;

    - difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures, business cultures,
compensation structures and accounting and other policies;

    - difficulties in the acculturation of employees, which may be increased by our remote first work
environment;

    - difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company;

    - challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;

    - challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the
future success of the combined company; and

    - challenges in keeping key business relationships in place.

OpenText will provide certain services to us following the consummation of the AMC Acquisition on a transitional
basis to facilitate the integration of the AMC business pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement. We cannot assure
you that all such functions will be successfully executed by OpenText during the transition period. We may be unable
to replace such services in a timely manner or on comparable terms. An interruption to these services could materially
and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Following the AMC Acquisition, we will assume certain potential liabilities relating to the AMC business, including
certain intellectual property matters, such as a matter filed by IBM in November 2022 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York alleging copyright infringement, as well as certain employee-related matters. As
we integrate the AMC business into our operations, we may learn additional information about the AMC business,
such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. It is possible that
these liabilities may exceed our expectations or that other liabilities, whether currently known or unknown to us, may
result in substantial losses. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly
litigation and divert the attention of technical and management personnel. These liabilities could have a material
adverse effect on our business to the extent we have not identified such liabilities or have underestimated the scope of
such liabilities. For additional information, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities,
decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings and diversion of management’s time and energy, each of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
even if the operations of our business and the AMC business are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the AMC
Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities, or cash flows that are
expected, and we will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be
achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the
integration of the AMC business. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key
employees, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may adversely affect our ability to
maintain relationships with customers, other providers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the
AMC Acquisition. These integration matters and our significant amount of indebtedness may hinder our ability to
make further acquisitions and could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after consummation of
the AMC Acquisition. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the AMC
Acquisition or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We will incur significant one-time integration costs in connection with the AMC Acquisition._**

We expect to incur significant one-time integration costs and capital investments in connection with the AMC
Acquisition. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to the AMC Acquisition.
These costs and expenses are not reflected in the pro forma financial information included in this offering
memorandum.

**_The future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its_**
**_expanded operations following the AMC Acquisition._**

Following the AMC Acquisition, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond
the current size of either our business or the AMC business. The combined company’s future success depends, in part,
upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for the management of the
combined company, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated
increased costs and complexity. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs, expenses and
fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the AMC Acquisition.

**_The pro forma financial statements included in this offering memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes_**
**_only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operation following consummation of_**
**_the AMC Acquisition. This offering memorandum includes financial and operational information derived from_**
**_information prepared by other entities, which our management cannot independently verify._**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information contained in this offering memorandum (i) has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only, (ii) is based on various adjustments and assumptions made by us that are
inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,
all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, (iii) may not necessarily be indicative
of the combined company’s future results of operations or financial position for any future period and (iv) does not
give effect to the final determination of fair value and final adjustments to the purchase price, if any. Accordingly, the
actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein.
The AMC Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method with Rocket as
the accounting acquirer in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Under this method of accounting,
the total consideration will be allocated to the AMC business’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon
their estimated fair values, with limited exception for acquired deferred revenue balance, as of the closing date of the
AMC Acquisition. Our actual financial condition and results of operations following consummation of the AMC
Acquisition may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements. In addition, the
assumptions used in preparing the pro forma combined financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other
factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following consummation of the AMC Acquisition.
Additionally, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect any anticipated
synergies or dis-synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the AMC Acquisition or any
integration costs that may be incurred. The AMC Acquisition may also give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs.
See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

In addition, we included in this offering memorandum certain financial and operational information of the AMC
business. The historical financial and operational information of the AMC business reflects the AMC business as
operated by OpenText following the MF Acquisition by OpenText on January 31, 2023 and is derived from (i) Micro
Focus’s accounting records for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 and (ii) OpenText’s accounting
records for the period from and after February 1, 2023. Except as expressly noted, OpenText has not prepared or
reviewed any information about the AMC business or the combined business for this offering memorandum or
confirmed the accuracy of the information included in this offering memorandum. We cannot assure you that such
financial and operational information would not be materially different it if were prepared by us. In addition, the AMC
business’s historical financial and operational information may not reflect the AMC business’s results of operations,
financial position and cash flows had the AMC business been a standalone company or been part of Rocket during the
periods presented and may not be indicative of the results of operations that we will achieve following the AMC
Acquisition.


-----

**_Prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement or other related_**
**_transaction documents may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of the Acquisition Agreement or other_**
**_related documents without noteholder consent._**

Prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement or other related
transaction documents may agree to amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. The transaction parties may agree
to make changes to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or waive certain conditions to the Acquisition Agreement
without obtaining noteholder consent.

**_Unless the AMC Acquisition will be consummated on the issue date of the notes, if the Escrow Release Conditions_**
**_are not satisfied, we will be required to redeem the notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you_**
**_expect on the notes._**

If the issue date of the notes occurs prior to the date that the Acquisition Date, the Issuer will execute and deliver the
Escrow Agreement and the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes will be deposited into the Escrow Account.
The release of Escrowed Property to us to consummate the AMC Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including the closing of the AMC Acquisition substantially concurrently with or promptly
following the release of such Escrowed Property. The consummation of the AMC Acquisition is subject to customary
closing conditions, including regulatory conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the regulatory
conditions in the Acquisition Agreement have been satisfied. If (i) the closing of the AMC Acquisition has not
occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, (ii) we notify the Trustee in writing prior to the Outside Date that we will
not pursue the consummation of the AMC Acquisition or (iii) the Acquisition Agreement has been terminated prior
to the Outside Date without the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, we will be required to redeem all of the
outstanding notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, from and including the issue date of the notes, or the most recent date to which interest has
been paid on the notes, whichever is later, to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. The Escrow
Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the notes, which is included
in the special mandatory redemption price. In the event that the special mandatory price payable upon such special
mandatory redemption for the notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, we will be required to
fund the difference between the applicable special mandatory redemption price and the amount of the Escrowed
Property pursuant to a commitment provided by us. We may not have sufficient funds to ensure such redemption price
is paid in full on the date of redemption.

Upon such special mandatory redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an
investment that yields comparable returns to those of the notes. Additionally, you may suffer a loss on your investment
if you purchase the notes at a price greater than the issue price of the notes. You will have no rights under the special
mandatory redemption provisions as long as the AMC Acquisition is consummated on or on or before the Outside
Date, unless the AMC Acquisition is terminated earlier. You will not have any right to require us to repurchase your
notes if, between the closing of this offering and the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, we experience any
changes (including any material changes) in our business or financial condition, or if the terms of the AMC Acquisition
change, including in material respects. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

**_In a bankruptcy proceeding, the holders of notes might not be able to apply the Escrowed Property to repay the_**
**_notes without bankruptcy court approval._**

If we commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against us, while the Escrow Account
remains funded, applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the Trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes
from using the Escrowed Property to pay the special mandatory redemption. The court adjudicating that case might
find that the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property are the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the
amounts in the Escrow Account will be pledged as security for the notes during the term of the escrow, the automatic
stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws generally prohibit (or at a minimum
delay) secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court
approval (which may not be given under the facts and circumstances or could be materially delayed). As a result,
holders of the notes may not be able to have the funds in the Escrow Account applied at the time or in the manner
contemplated by the indenture that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a result. If the court adjudicating


-----

that case finds that the Escrow Account and Escrowed Property are the property of the bankruptcy estate, the court
could authorize the use of such funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or
without restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate or
could be forced to accept less liquid or saleable collateral in exchange for the Escrowed Property as adequate protection
or otherwise. In such event, the only remedy available to the holders of the notes would be to sue for payment on the
notes.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the notes and the completion of the AMC Acquisition, the parties to the_**
**_Acquisition Agreement or other related transaction documents may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions_**
**_of the Acquisition Agreement or other related documents without noteholder consent._**

Prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement or other related
transaction documents may agree to amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. The Escrow Agreement will provide
as a condition to the release of the Escrowed Property that we certify that the AMC Acquisition is expected to be
completed substantially concurrently with or promptly following the release of the funds in the Escrow Account. The
transaction parties may agree to make changes to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or waive certain conditions
to the Acquisition Agreement without obtaining noteholder consent.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_We will have substantial indebtedness and may incur additional debt in the future, including secured debt, which_**
**_could substantially reduce our profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and prevent_**
**_us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes._**

As of December 31, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $4,634
million of total indebtedness (including the notes offered hereby), and the ability to incur an additional $374 million
under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility (after giving effect to letters of credit issued thereunder). This
debt requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. Subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit
agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) credit
agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing
the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, we or our subsidiaries may incur
additional debt in the future, including secured debt, or other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, which
could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations
could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:

    - our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders may be impaired, resulting in possible defaults on and
acceleration of our indebtedness;

    - our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital,
capital expenditures, including costs associated with any international expansion, product and service
development, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired;

    - our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt
financing may be impaired;

    - a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be used to repay the principal and interest
on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;

    - we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns, increases in interest rates, adverse changes
in industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;

    - our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, the competitive landscape and the
markets in which we operate may be limited; and

    - we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less
debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates.


-----

Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be
affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. If we do not comply with
these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures,
selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. The
credit agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility)
credit agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture
governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby each impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on
business opportunities.

The credit agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan
facility) credit agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
indenture governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby contain operating
covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with
them. These restrictions will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other
things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments, loans and advances;

    - incur certain liens;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate;

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the Issuer or the Guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

    - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, we and our restricted subsidiaries will be subject to covenants and events of default in respect of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

The restrictions in the credit agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a
side car term loan facility) credit agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby may
prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and make it difficult for
us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not subject to similar
restrictions. We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that could subject us to additional restrictive
covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers form the
lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations,
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction
initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic
conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a
default or event of default under the credit agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in
the form of a side car term loan facility) credit agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes


-----

offered hereby, which, if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their
due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings,
our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely
affected and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our
ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and
stockholders.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness” for additional information about the covenants set forth in the credit
agreement or (if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) credit
agreements, that governs or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and indenture governing
the Existing Notes and “Description of Notes” for additional information about the covenants set forth in the indenture
that will govern the notes offered hereby.

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends on and is
subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic,
financial, competitive, business and other factors and reimbursement actions of governmental and commercial payers,
all of which are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital
markets. Lower net revenues before provision for doubtful accounts, or higher provision for uncollectibles, generally
will reduce our cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations,
that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our debt or to
fund our other liquidity needs.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce
or delay capital expenditures, including those for integrating our historical acquisitions or for future corporate
development activities. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions
would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or that these actions would be
permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including the credit agreement or (if the USD
Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) credit agreements, that governs
or will govern, as applicable, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the Existing Notes and the
indenture governing the notes.

Any restructuring or refinancing of all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, could cause us to default on our
debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition
of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments
of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which
could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our
indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could
further restrict our business operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to declare all the
funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If we breach our covenants
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The lenders could exercise their rights,
as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All of these events could result in your
losing your investment in the notes.

**_Our variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase_**
**_significantly and potentially limit our ability to effectively refinance our indebtedness as it matures._**

Our debt outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest
rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our variable rate debt began to rise
significantly in 2022 and 2023, and these increases may continue, or such increased rates may not be decreased
materially or at all, in 2024 and beyond. If interest rates continue to increase or remain high, our debt service


-----

obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase or remain high even though the amount borrowed will
remain the same, which will negatively impact our profitability and cash flows, including cash available for servicing
our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Financing Transactions,
a 0.125% increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt, assuming our Extended First Lien Revolving
Credit Facility is fully drawn and without giving effect to interest rate swaps and caps, would result in an increase or
decrease, as applicable of our total interest expense of $4.3 million. Additionally, higher interest rate will affect our
ability to refinance portions of our indebtedness in advance of their maturity dates on terms that we deem attractive.

In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and add stability to interest expense movements, we have
historically entered into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange
of variable for fixed rate interest payments. However, certain of those interest rate swaps and caps have expired or
will expire in the near term. New interest rate caps and the replacement of our expiring interest rate caps may be more
expensive as a result of increasing interest rates. There can be no assurance that any such derivative financial
instruments will have the desired beneficial impact or that we will be able to purchase additional interest rate caps or
similar or other derivatives in the future on a cost-effective basis or at all. If we are unable to enter into such derivative
financial instruments, or achieve favorable terms in such derivative financial instruments, in the future, it may
adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our
indebtedness and, even if we use these instruments to selectively manage risks, there can be no assurance that we will
be fully protected against material interest rate fluctuations.

**_We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at_**
**_all._**

We may in the future need debt financing to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. The market
conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our
ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable
terms or at all and our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the
indebtedness outstanding from time to time. The terms of additional financing may limit our financial and operating
flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the
availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms,
we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could
materially and adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events_**
**_beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our prospects,_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of
the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately.
We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding
debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration
under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries_**
**_that will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Claims of holders of the notes will be
structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non–guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and
will not be satisfied from the assets of these non–guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full.

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain
additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder.


-----

**_Sales of assets by the Issuer and the Guarantors could reduce the collateral securing the notes and the related_**
**_guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the notes will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession
of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral
securing the notes. To the extent the Issuer or a Guarantor sells any assets that constitute such collateral, the proceeds
from such sale will be subject to the liens securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees only to the
extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees under the
security documents that will relate to the notes. Such proceeds will also be subject to the security interests of certain
creditors other than the holders of the notes, some of which may be senior or prior to the liens held by the holders of
the notes, or may have a lien in those assets that is pari passu with the lien of the holders of the notes (including,
without limitation, the liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities). To the extent the proceeds from any sale
of collateral securing the notes do not constitute collateral under the security documents that will relate to the notes,
the pool of assets securing the notes and the related guarantees will be reduced, and the notes and the related guarantees
will not be secured by such proceeds.

**_The value of the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the notes._**

Obligations under the notes will be secured, as are the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, by first-priority liens on certain
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. No appraisal of the value of such collateral has been made in connection with
the offering of the notes, and the fair market value of the collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that
include, among others, changing economic conditions, inflation, higher interest rate, competition and other future
trends. By its nature, some or all of the collateral securing the notes may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a firstpriority lien on such collateral will share the proceeds of such collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby
diluting the collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the collateral
may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the collateral, if any. There also
can be no assurance that the collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be
uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any
claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the collateral
securing the notes and the remaining obligations under the notes and all of our other obligations secured by a _pari_
_passu lien on collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated_
indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of
the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the
extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceeded the value of the collateral securing the notes (after
taking into account all other first-priority debt that was also secured by the collateral securing the notes, including the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes.
As a result, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to enable the holders of the notes to have an allowed claim
for post-petition or post-filing interest, fees and expenses in an insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any of the
Guarantors. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the holders of the notes may
be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes and our other
first-priority secured obligations exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing the notes and the related
guarantees.”

With respect to some of the collateral securing the notes, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its
ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents
and making additional filings. If the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor is unable to obtain these consents or make
these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders may not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery
with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all.
These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other auction
and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore,
the practical value of realizing on the collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited.


-----

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the Issuer will be permitted to incur
indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. All of the
commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by the collateral securing the notes on a firstpriority lien basis and will be entitled to payment out of the proceeds of any sale of such collateral on a _pari passu_
basis with the holders of the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will also permit the Issuer
and the Guarantors to create additional liens on the collateral securing the notes under specified circumstances, some
of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens
may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral securing the
notes available to satisfy holders of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the collateral securing the notes, the_**
**_Bank Collateral Agent will initially control actions with respect to that collateral pursuant to the First Lien_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral that will secure the notes on a first-priority basis
will be subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on
a first-priority basis, including the obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Under the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such shared collateral, including the ability
to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control such proceedings, will
be at the exclusive direction of the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which the obligations
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility if the USD Incremental
Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of a side car term loan facility) are discharged (which discharge does not
include certain refinancings of the applicable Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of
an event of default under the indenture or any other agreement governing first lien indebtedness subject to the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if the authorized representative of the holders of such indebtedness represents the largest
outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on shared collateral and such
authorized representative has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the Bank Collateral Agent has
not commenced and is not then diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such shared collateral or
any portion thereof or the Issuer or any Guarantor is not then a debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

When the Bank Collateral Agent does not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the shared collateral, such
right will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the shared collateral. If the Issuer issues additional indebtedness that
is equal in priority to the lien securing the notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the
authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never
have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral securing the notes.

In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Bank Collateral Agent
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral securing the notes resulting in a sale thereof,
the lien securing the notes on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds
from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations). The collateral so released
will no longer secure the Issuer’s and the applicable Guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees.
The holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a
bankruptcy, as the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from,
among other things, objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession
financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral or to our use of cash collateral that has not been opposed
to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions
and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the
notes would be unable to raise an objection.

Further, under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of
any shared collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the
discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations for distribution in accordance with the


-----

provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, there can
be no assurances that under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes would not be obligated to
turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any collateral securing the notes, proceeds or payments
they may receive.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees will be secured only by
the collateral described in this offering memorandum. The Notes Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose on such
collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state or foreign law
requirements, applicable bankruptcy law and practical problems associated with the realization of the Notes Collateral
Agent’s security interest in or lien on such collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the collateral within the
time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings,
statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you that the consents of any
third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will be given when required
to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the collateral securing
the notes will be sufficient to make all payments on the notes.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to create or perfect the_**
**_security interests._**

The collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees will include substantially all of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets which assets also secure the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ indebtedness under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future, subject to certain
exceptions. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. We will have
limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing
of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected on the date of
the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the
collateral. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

If additional wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries or wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries organized under
the laws of England or Wales are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the
notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such
domestic guarantors (and, in respect of subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, filings with
the applicable registries would be required). Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral,
additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain
property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property
and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to
monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the
future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral under the indenture that will govern the notes, and
that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None
of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Bank Collateral Agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other
than the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility if the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility is incurred in the form of
a side car term loan facility) or, if applicable, the Side Car Collateral Agent will have any obligation to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make filings to
perfect or maintain the perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security
interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third
parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired or arising in the future,
such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances.
See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral and it is not possible to conduct lien searches in jurisdictions_**
**_in which certain foreign Guarantors are located._**


-----

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the collateral that will secure the notes and certain guarantees thereof
will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and such guarantees and could have an adverse
effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the collateral securing the notes and
such guarantees.

In addition, it is not possible to conduct comprehensive lien searches in the jurisdiction in which the foreign Guarantors
are organized. As a result, no assurance can be given that no liens exist securing significant obligations having priority
on certain of the collateral, which liens may prevent or inhibit the Notes Collateral Agent from foreclosing on the liens
securing the notes and may impair the value of the collateral that will secure the notes. For example, we cannot
guarantee that information provided to us in response to company searches with the Registrar of Companies in England
for security charges against our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales are accurate and
complete because, for example, information which should have been registered with the Registrar of Companies may
not have been so registered or information that has been lodged for inclusion in our English subsidiary’s file may not
have been fully updated.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our
business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or
in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss or
impairment in value of any of the collateral securing the notes, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy
all of the secured obligations, including the notes and the applicable guarantees.

**_Limitations on the guarantees and the collateral under the laws of England and Wales may adversely affect the_**
**_validity and enforceability of the guarantees and the collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of England and Wales. Enforcement of the obligations against
a Guarantor, and/or any collateral provided by any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, under the laws of England and Wales. These laws and defenses
may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance
or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting
the amounts recoverable under guarantees and collateral and the amounts recoverable thereunder. For additional
information, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and Security” and “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the collateral to be_**
**_either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. There are also certain other assets that are also excluded_**
**_from the collateral securing the notes._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional debt, including
purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of such liens, the liens on the
related assets securing the notes and the applicable guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be either
subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional liens on such additional debt in favor
of third parties is subject to limitations as described under the heading “Description of Notes.” Additionally, the assets
of affiliated practices will not secure the notes and the applicable guarantees. In addition, certain assets are excluded
from the collateral securing the notes and the applicable guarantees, as discussed under “Description of Notes—
Security for the Notes.”

In addition, in certain instances, assets that have been pledged in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will not
be required to secure the notes, such as the capital stock of the Issuer. We will also not be required to take certain steps
to create or perfect securities interests in certain collateral. Although the holders of the notes, pursuant to the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, should receive the benefit of their pro rata portion of any proceeds of any collateral
pledged in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, their ability to realize those proceeds would be subject to the
risks relating to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described herein.

If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the notes is accelerated, the notes and the guarantees will rank pari
_passu with the holders of other unsecured or senior indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded_
property. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of
the holders of the notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full and remaining claims will rank equally in right of
payment with the claims of our unsecured creditors.

**_The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release any guarantor under the_**
**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause such Guarantor to be released from_**
**_its guarantee of the notes._**

While any obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, a Guarantor’s guarantee of the
notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the Trustee, at the discretion of
lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, if the Guarantor no longer guarantees obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities or any other indebtedness thereunder. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no
longer a Guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured
or unsecured, of those non–guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

In addition, the guarantee of certain Guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such Guarantor in a
transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes and upon certain other events described in
“Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by any two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the applicable notes during
any periods in which such notes are rated investment grade by any two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, provided that at
such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the
notes will ever be rated investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that such notes will maintain these
ratings, any suspension of the covenants under the indenture that will govern such notes would allow us to engage in
certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended
covenants are subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result
in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain_**
**_circumstances, to void the notes, the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and/or the guarantees,_**
**_subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees, and/or require holders of the notes to return_**
**_payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on_**
**_the notes._**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees and the grant of liens by the Issuer and the Guarantors (including any
future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review under U.S. federal and state fraudulent conveyance and
fraudulent transfer statutes (including federal bankruptcy laws) if an action (either in connection with a bankruptcy,
liquidation, or reorganization case or under a lawsuit in which a bankruptcy is not involved) were commenced at some
future date by the Issuer or by any of the Guarantors (or by any bankruptcy trustee appointed therefor), or by or on
behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a Guarantor. While the relevant laws may vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees and the grant of
liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance
of the notes or guarantees or the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying, or defrauding
other creditors, or (ii) the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or granting the liens and, in the case of (ii) only,
any one of the following is also true:

    - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or
the guarantees (or the related security interest with respect to the notes or the guarantees);


-----

    - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the granting of the related security interests with respect to
the notes or the guarantees) left the Issuer or any of the Guarantors with an unreasonably small amount
of capital to carry on the business or a transaction in which the Issuer or such Guarantor was engaged or
about to engage; or

    - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our
or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or the granting of liens was a fraudulent conveyance
or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee (and any related
liens) in total or in part or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer or such Guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you
may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with
respect to our other debt and that of the Guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon
the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use
to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard
that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any
payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent
conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not
be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s other debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property
is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. Also, for this analysis, “debts” includes contingent and
unliquidated debts. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee (or related liens) if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not
substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus,
if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was
incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable
Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void
the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable Guarantor’s other debt or take other action
detrimental to the holders of the notes.

To the extent a court voids any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or holds any of the
guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the
applicable Guarantor. If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable Guarantor’s assets would be
applied first to satisfy the applicable Guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of
the guarantee of the notes. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the
remaining Guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received
from the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor. Even if the guarantee of a Guarantor is not voided as a fraudulent transfer,
a court may subordinate the guarantee to that Guarantor’s other debt, and in that event, the guarantees would be
subordinated (including structurally) to all of that Guarantor’s other debt.


-----

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that
Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under
its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter
or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount
that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a Guarantor under a guarantee made
at a time the Issuer or such Guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the
Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is
made to an insider within a one-year period (or within 90 days for any non-insider party) prior to a bankruptcy filing
and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditors would
have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the
guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the Guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the
court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable
conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and
(iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they
were pledged to secure, or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge
of collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any liens delivered or reinstated
and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable
by the pledgor (as a debtor-in-possession) or guarantor (as a debtor-in-possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or
potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the
pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge and/or
issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical
Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy
proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection
thereof and/or the issuance of the guarantee or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or
any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any pledge of collateral not
pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the issue date of the notes had been pledged or perfected or issued (as
applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are
materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the
notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be
subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a
preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the notes
and the applicable guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by federal bankruptcy
law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuer or the Guarantors or the related guarantees
prior to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or
repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from
a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover,
bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds,
products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments,
provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may
vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest
in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such
time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic
stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy


-----

case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the
value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a
bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the notes could be made following
the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such
payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or
dispose of the collateral securing the notes, the value of such collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy
proceedings or at any time thereafter, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of such collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection” or otherwise.

Furthermore, any disposition of the collateral securing the notes during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary
course of business would also require prior approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the
circumstances).

Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral securing the notes is not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations, as defined in “Description
of Notes,” the holders of the notes would be considered “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the
payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a creditor holding “undersecured” claims during
a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of
its claims.

In addition, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be
provided to us that is secured by the collateral securing the notes or to our use of cash collateral that has not been
opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain
conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral securing the notes could materially
deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the guarantees and the collateral may adversely affect their validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

Our obligations under the notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Certain of the Guarantors are organized under
the laws of England and Wales. The insolvency laws of England & Wales may not be as favorable to your interests as
the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Although laws differ amongst these
jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and,
in the case of the guarantees and the collateral, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the guarantee against a Guarantor. A court may also in certain
circumstances void the guarantee or the collateral where a Guarantor or security provider is close to or in the vicinity
of insolvency. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and Security.”

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have_**
**_an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes and our other first-priority_**
**_secured obligations exceed the fair market value of the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding brought by or against the
Issuer or any Guarantors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar federal, state or foreign law for the relief of
debtors, including any applicable federal or state corporate statute relating to the compromise or arrangement of
indebtedness, holders of the notes will only be entitled to post-petition interest, fees and expenses to the extent that
the value of their security interest in the collateral securing the notes, taken in order of priority with all the other
obligations secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis, is greater than the amount of their pre-bankruptcy claim
(and all other claims against us or the Guarantors that are secured by the collateral on a first-priority basis). Holders
of the notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes (and
all of our other first-priority obligations) exceed the fair market value of the collateral. Accordingly, in any bankruptcy
proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have guaranteed the notes, it is possible that the


-----

bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount
of the notes and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the
notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated
between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of
security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of
the collateral securing the notes.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on
the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the
part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed
above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal
amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes. As a result, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to
enable the holders of the notes to have an allowed claim for post-petition or post-filing interest, fees, and expenses in
an insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors.

**_Because any Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, the holders of the notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

Holders of the notes have the benefit of the guarantees of any current or future Guarantor. However, any guarantee
will be limited to the maximum amount that such guarantor is permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result,
a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon (among other things) the amount
of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under
federal or state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee
(and any related security interest) or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. See “U.S. federal
and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the
notes, the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and/or the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes
and the guarantees, and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees
and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular
guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the notes, under which the collateral securing_**
**_the notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent, and_**
**_you may not realize any payment upon the release of such collateral._**

Under various circumstances, the collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:

    - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (to a person that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture. See “Description of Notes—Security for
the Notes—Release or Subordination of Collateral”;

    - if such property or assets become Excluded Property (as defined in “Description of Notes”);

    - with respect to collateral held by a Guarantor of the notes, upon the release of such Guarantor from its
related guarantees;

    - pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, upon any release in connection with a
foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such collateral by the controlling collateral agent in
accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; or

    - if the notes would be rated investment grade by two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch after giving effect to
such lien release. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Release or Subordination of
Collateral.”


-----

The aggregate value of the collateral that will secure the notes will be reduced to the extent of the value of the released
collateral. The value of any released collateral could be significant and there can be no assurance that the value of the
remaining collateral (if any) would be sufficient to satisfy all obligations owed by us to holders of the notes and the
holders of any additional secured indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the notes with respect to such remaining
collateral, including the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that
is a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for
purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the liens on any collateral owned by that subsidiary or any
of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under
the indenture that will govern the notes. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of
the collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries
are released. In addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the
assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.

**_The Notes Collateral Agent may not be able to possess certain assets located outside of the United States on_**
**_enforcement or in an insolvency and may also be prevented from holding security interests in certain collateral_**
**_securing the notes located outside of the United States._**

A portion of the assets to be pledged by the Issuers and Guarantors as collateral for the notes is located in jurisdictions
outside the United States. Applicable laws may restrict the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent from taking possession
of certain collateral securing the notes located outside of the United States on enforcement or in an insolvency. In
addition, certain jurisdictions restrict the ability of foreign entities to hold the benefit of security interests over certain
assets. This may mean that the Notes Collateral Agent will be unable to benefit from security interests in certain
collateral securing the notes located outside of the United States and may also restrict the ability of the Notes Collateral
Agent to transfer collateral securing the notes into its name on enforcement or in an insolvency.

**_The Notes Collateral Agent may not be able to receive security in foreign jurisdictions which is pari passu to the_**
**_Senior Secured Credit Facilities._**

The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the collateral securing the notes will be created pursuant to security
documents entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to
the creation and priority of liens in the jurisdictions in which the collateral securing the notes is pledged, will give it,
in many cases, as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the collateral agents under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. In such cases, holders of the notes will have to rely on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to provide
first-priority liens on such assets subject to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be. As a result,
the first-priority lien of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral securing the notes will be dependent on
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide that the rights of the holders of the notes with respect to
the collateral securing the notes are secured on a first-priority basis. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may not
be recognized in certain jurisdictions.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of notes or under the related guarantees or collateral documents across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized under the laws of multiple jurisdictions, including
England and Wales and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could
be initiated in any of these jurisdictions, such that it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater
uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the notes and the related guarantees
and collateral documents will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there
can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings. The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests
as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. In addition, the
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization
may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority


-----

of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and duration of the
proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and the guarantees
and collateral documents in these jurisdictions, or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer required by the indenture that will govern the notes._**

Upon a change of control triggering event, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the
right to require the Issuer to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In order to obtain sufficient
funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the notes. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to
purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the
indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt, including
debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment
requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture
that will govern the notes.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that_**
**_do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that will govern
the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuer to purchase the notes, notwithstanding the fact
that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital
structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations that would not constitute a change of
control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

The indenture that governs the notes also contains exceptions that permit us to undertake certain corporate and tax
transactions without complying with the covenants contained in the indenture, including certain tax planning and tax
reorganization transactions and reorganizations in preparation for any initial public offering. These transactions could
permit value to be transferred from our company and our restricted subsidiaries, including additional tax distributions
to our owners, without being subject to restrictions under the indenture.

In addition, one of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of “all
or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law and the interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and circumstances.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all
our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_The change of control provisions under the indenture governing the notes will not require the Issuer to offer to_**
**_purchase the notes upon certain specified change of control events._**

The occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a “change of control” under the indenture that will
govern the notes will not be deemed to be a change of control triggering if (i) the consolidated total leverage ratio of
the Company would be no greater than 6.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis as of the date of consummation of a permitted
change of control (such date, the “Permitted Change of Control Effective Date”) (tested, at the Issuer’s option, on a
pro forma basis as of the time of signing the applicable sale transaction), (ii) the new permitted holder shall either be
(a)(I) a private equity fund, similar investment fund or sovereign wealth fund, or consortium of private equity funds,
similar investment funds or sovereign wealth funds acting in concert that (x) (in the case of each such fund other than
a sovereign wealth fund) invests, as a substantial part of its business, in companies that are not, at the time of
investment, in financial distress, as determined by the Issuer in good faith, and (y) together with their affiliated funds,
have committed capital and/or assets under management in excess of $1.0 billion and (II) a special purpose acquisition
company sponsored by the person(s) described in clause (ii)(a)(I) above and (b) a strategic or other corporate business
engaged directly or indirectly in a business reasonably related or similar to the Company’s business; provided, that, if


-----

the new permitted holder is (a) an entity as set forth in subclause (ii)(a) above, the Company (or any successor thereof)
shall have obtained a public corporate credit rating of at least B3 from Moody’s and B- from S&P or (b) an entity as
set forth in subclause (ii)(b) above, the Company (or any successor thereof) shall have obtained a public corporate
credit rating of at least Ba3 from Moody’s and BB- from S&P (in each case, after giving effect to the change of control
and all transactions related thereto). For more details, see the section “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event” and related definitions.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes. We do not intend to apply for listing of
the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. Although we have been informed
by certain of the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the notes, they are not obliged to do
so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

    - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

    - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the conditions of the financial markets; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate
in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.

Historically, the market for non–investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for any
of the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at
which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from
their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and
other factors.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes_**
**_under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the notes. The holders of the notes will not
be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in
the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite
period of time. The Issuer is not obligated to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the
notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding,
they may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and
applicable state securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of notes comply with applicable
securities laws. These restrictions could limit the liquidity or affect the price of the notes. Because the notes will be
issued in the form of global notes and affiliates of the Issuer may hold interests in the global notes, the notes you hold
may be subject to transfer restrictions until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate of the Issuer, is no longer the


-----

owner of such note or no longer holds an interest in such global note. This means that the notes you hold may be
subject to transfer restrictions indefinitely. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture that will govern the notes by beneficial owners_**
**_with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the notes, each holder of notes agrees, in connection with any notice of Default (as defined below)
or Event of Default (as defined below), notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent, if applicable, to provide a notice of Default or Event of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action
(a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral
Agent, if applicable, that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment
in the notes are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of Notes”) and (ii) provide the Issuer with
such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such
holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. Holders of the notes, including holders that have
hedged their exposure to the notes in the ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not be able to make
such representations or provide the requested additional information. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability
to participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a representation.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002._**

Since we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after the offering, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes–
Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of
those controls on a quarterly basis. SOX also requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation
of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have
the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with
these requirements and therefore we will not have comparable procedures in place as compared to public companies.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered with the_**
**_SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were registering the
offering of notes with the SEC. This lack of information could impair your ability to evaluate your investment in the
notes. We cannot assure you that the historical and pro forma financial information as set forth in this offering
memorandum will be indicative of our future financial performance or our ability to meet our obligations.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely affect the_**
**_market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating
agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view
of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non–investment grade rating on the issue date. There can be no
assurances that such rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis
of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell
the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect
of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of the notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.


-----

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and we will not be_**
**_required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the
“Trust Indenture Act”), and we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.
Therefore, holders of the notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture
Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and commissions and
estimated expenses payable by us, will be approximately $    million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the
offering of the notes, together with borrowings under our Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities, proceeds from
the Equity Contribution and cash on hand, to (i) finance and consummate the AMC Acquisition and (ii) pay transaction
expenses and fees in connection with the foregoing. The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have made
commitments to us with respect to the increased commitments under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit
Facility, the Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facilities and a senior secured bridge facility, in each case, to finance
a portion of the Transactions or for general corporate purposes, and will receive customary fees in connection with
such commitments. The proceeds of the notes, together with a portion of the Incremental First Lien Term Loan
Facilities, will reduce the bridge commitments in full.

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with this offering, based on estimated
amounts outstanding at the closing of this offering. Actual amounts may vary from the estimated amounts shown
below depending on several factors, including accrued interest on our indebtedness, working capital needs and
differences from our estimated fees, costs, and expenses.

You should read the following together with the information included under the sections entitled “Capitalization” and
“Summary––Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information” included elsewhere in this

approximately $222 million to approximately $375 million, (y) extend the maturity date of certain of the
revolving commitments thereunder from November 28, 2026 to August 29, 2028 and (z) change certain other

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Rocket and the AMC business as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is derived from Rocket’s historical audited consolidated financial
statements, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and the AMC business’s audited historical
combined carveout financial statements, which have been prepared specifically for the purpose of the AMC
Acquisition and which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, presented on a “carve-out” basis from
(i) Micro Focus’s accounting records for the period from January 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023 and (ii) OpenText’s
accounting records for the period from and after February 1, 2023.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented as follows:

  - The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was prepared based
on (i) the historical audited consolidated balance sheet of Rocket as of December 31, 2023 and (ii) the
historical audited combined carveout balance sheet of the AMC business as of December 31, 2023.

  - The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for
the year ended December 31, 2023 was prepared based on (i) the historical consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive income of Rocket for the year ended December 31, 2023 and (ii) the historical
audited combined carveout statement of income and comprehensive income of the AMC business for the
year ended December 31, 2023.

The base purchase price for the AMC Acquisition is a cash payment of $2.275 billion (the “Purchase Consideration”),
subject to customary net working capital adjustments and indebtedness as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement
(collectively, the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Consideration is to be funded from cash on hand and additional
debt equity commitments (as defined herein) (collectively, for purpose of this section, the “Financing Transactions”).
See _Note 2, Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting_
_Pronouncements_ to Rocket’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum for further information.

The AMC Acquisition is expected to close substantially concurrently with or promptly after the closing of this offering
of the notes. The AMC Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method with
Rocket as the accounting acquirer in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business
Combinations (“ASC 805”). Under this method of accounting, the total consideration will be allocated to the AMC
business’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, with limited exception for
acquired deferred revenue balance, as of the closing date of the AMC Acquisition. The process of valuing the net
assets of the AMC business at the expected closing date of the AMC Acquisition, as well as evaluating accounting
policies for conformity, is preliminary. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the purchase price
allocation reflected in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is preliminary and subject
to revision based on a final determination of fair value and final adjustments to the Purchase Price.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the preliminary information available
and management’s preliminary valuation of the fair value of intangible and tangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Certain assets and liabilities acquired, as well as the working capital adjustments, will be valued as part of
the final purchase accounting assessment and have not been fully considered in the preliminary valuation.
Accordingly, the actual purchase accounting assessment may vary based on final analyses of the valuation of assets
to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed, particularly in regard to definite-lived intangible assets and deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which could be material.

The financial information included in this “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information”
section is not intended to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
and related notes are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the combined
company’s actual results of operations or financial position would have been had the Transactions been completed on


-----

the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the combined company’s future results of operations or
financial position for any future period. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based
on information and assumptions that are described in the accompanying notes. The actual financial position and results
of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein. Further, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information does not reflect any anticipated synergies or dis-synergies, operating
efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the AMC Acquisition or any integration costs that may be incurred.
The results and balances reflected herein are not intended to be a projection of future financial position or results of
operations of Rocket following the completion of the Transactions, which may vary materially from the results
reflected because of various factors. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if
the Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2023, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 is presented as if the Transactions
had occurred on January 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented herein
has been derived from:

  - Rocket’s historical audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023; and

  - The AMC business’s audited combined carveout financial statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2023, prepared specifically for the purpose of the AMC Acquisition, which are included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information gives effect to the Transactions, which
includes adjustments for the following:

  - Certain reclassification and accounting policy alignment adjustments to conform the AMC business’s
historical financial statement presentation to Rocket’s presentation;

  - The application of the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805; and

  - The uses of proceeds of the Financing Transactions consummated in connection with the Transactions.

This unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical
audited consolidated financial statements of Rocket, the historical audited combined carveout financial statements of
the AMC business, “Rocket’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” “AMC Business’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and other sections included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Note 1. Basis of Presentation**

The historical audited consolidated financial statements for Rocket and audited combined carveout financial
statements for the AMC business have been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information to give effect to certain pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Transactions and are
factually supportable.

Both the Rocket and AMC business historical financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and
presented in U.S. dollars.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with ASC 805, with Rocket determined to be the accounting acquirer based on preliminary
analysis of the Acquisition Agreement and based on the historical audited consolidated financial statements of Rocket
and the historical audited combined carveout financial statements of the AMC business. Under ASC 805, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized and measured at their assumed acquisition
date fair value, while transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess
of acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to
goodwill.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is presented as if the
Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2023 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 give effect to the Transactions as
if they had occurred on January 1, 2023. There were no material transactions between Rocket and the AMC business
during the period presented. Accordingly, adjustments to eliminate transactions between Rocket and the AMC business
have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented herein.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only
and do not represent the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income
had the Transactions been completed as of the dates indicated. The pro forma adjustments have been made on available
information and on assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances to reflect, on a pro
forma basis, the impact of the Transactions on the historical financial information. See the notes to the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial information below for a discussion of certain assumptions made. The unaudited
pro forma combined financial information does not project the combined company’s results of the operations or
financial position for any future period or date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the AMC Acquisition—The pro
forma financial statements included in this offering memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only and may
not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operation following consummation of the AMC Acquisition.
This offering memorandum includes financial and operational information derived from information prepared by other
entities, which our management cannot independently verify.”

**Note 2. Description of the Financing Transactions**

To finance the AMC Acquisition, the Company intends to consummate the following Financing Transactions. All
terms are to be finalized and may materially change from the estimates included herein.

**The Notes**

Rocket intends to issue $1,000 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028. Rocket expects
to incur approximately $46.1 million in fees in connection with the offering of the notes.

**Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

Rocket intends to (i) amend certain terms of the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things,
(x) increase the aggregate principal amount of commitments by approximately $222 million to approximately $375


-----

million, (y) extend the maturity date of certain of the revolving commitments thereunder from November 28, 2026 to
August 29, 2028 and (z) change certain other terms thereof and (ii) enter into the Incremental First Lien Term Loan
Facilities with a syndicate of lenders that will rank pari passu with the Existing First Lien Term Loans in a combined
aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million (reflecting U.S. dollar-equivalent for the Euro Incremental Term Loan
Facility) and which will in each case mature on November 28, 2028.

**Equity Contribution**

Certain investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital along with any additional co-investors designated by Bain
Capital (including existing equityholders of the Company) will directly or indirectly contribute in cash approximately
$200 million in common equity to the Company or a parent entity of the Company, the cash proceeds of which will
be further contributed to the Company and used to pay a portion of the Purchase Price of the AMC Acquisition.

**Note 3. Reclassification and Accounting Policy Alignment Adjustments**

During the preparation of this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, management
performed a preliminary analysis of the AMC business’s financial information to identify differences in accounting
policies compared to those of Rocket’s, and differences in financial statements presentation compared to the
presentation of Rocket, which are set forth below. At the time of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information, other than the adjustments described herein, Rocket is not aware of any other material
differences.

**Reclassification Adjustments Balance Sheet**

(i) To record the reclassification of “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” as reported by the AMC
business to “Accounts payable” and “Accrued expenses” as reported by Rocket.

**Reclassification Adjustments Statements of Operations**

(i) To record reclassification of “Cost of Revenues” as reported by the AMC business to “Amortization
of acquired technology-based intangibles assets” as reported by Rocket.

(ii) To record reclassification of “Depreciation and amortization” as reported by the AMC business to
“General and administrative” and “Amortization of other acquired intangibles assets” as reported
by Rocket.

(iii) To record reclassification of “Cost of revenues” in customer support, license, and professional
service as reported by the AMC business to “Cost of license, maintenance and service” as reported
by Rocket.

**Accounting Policy Adjustments**

(a) To record differences in accounting policy for accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The AMC
business elects to net accounts receivables against deferred revenue for contracts not commenced.
This adjustment is to reflect the gross impact of the accounts receivables and deferred revenue to
align with Rocket’s policy. The total balance of $32.2 million increases the accounts receivable and
deferred revenue balances.

(b) To record Rocket identified differences in policy for the accrual of certain maintenance revenue.
Historical results of the AMC business results include revenue accruals for certain revenue that is
not billable as of the close of a period. Rocket has elected to apply a practical expedient for such
revenue to record as it becomes billable. The resulting adjustment reduces accounts receivable by
$2.0 million and reduces revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 by $1.3 million. The pro
forma tax effect is calculated using the estimated blended statutory tax rate of approximately 22.6%.

**Note 4. Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet**

**Transaction Accounting Adjustments**

The AMC Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,
which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition
closing date fair values, with any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired, if any, recorded as goodwill. The accounting for the acquisition is based on currently
available information and is considered preliminary. The final accounting for the acquisition may differ materially
from that presented in this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes approximately $9.5


-----

million of transaction expenses, and estimated transaction costs through the AMC Acquisition closing are not
considered material.

_A._ _Estimated Purchase Consideration_

The estimated purchase consideration is $2.275 billion. This Purchase Consideration will be paid on the
consummation of the Transactions and is reflected as a reduction to cash in the unaudited condensed
combined balance sheet. The Purchase Consideration is to be funded with cash on hand and the Financing
Transactions undertaken by Rocket as discussed in Note 2.

_B._ _Preliminary Purchase_ _Price Allocation_

The following table summarized the preliminary aggregate purchase price allocation by major categories of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimate of fair values. The preliminary
allocation of the Purchase Consideration is as follows:

**_(In thousands)_** **Fair Value**
Accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses........................................................................................ $ 96,230
Unbilled accounts receivable ............................................................................................................................ 4,907
Prepaid expenses and other current assets ......................................................................................................... 3,999
Property and equipment, net.............................................................................................................................. 1,183
Right-of-use assets ............................................................................................................................................ 3,288
Unbilled accounts receivable, non-current ........................................................................................................ 2,664
Deferred tax assets ............................................................................................................................................ 20,136
Acquired intangible assets[(1)] .............................................................................................................................. 1,395,500
Other assets, net ................................................................................................................................................ 6,175
**Total assets ......................................................................................................................................................** **1,534,082**
Accounts payable .............................................................................................................................................. 3,323
Accrued expenses.............................................................................................................................................. 18,897
Current portion of operating lease obligations .................................................................................................. 1,757
Deferred revenue ............................................................................................................................................... 204,996
Operating lease obligations, net of current portion ............................................................................................ 1,563
Deferred revenue, net of current portion ........................................................................................................... 23,094
Deferred tax liabilities[(2)] .................................................................................................................................... 100,373
Other liabilities ................................................................................................................................................. 5,816
**Total liabilities .................................................................................................................................................** 359,819
**Net assets acquired ..........................................................................................................................................** 1,174,263
Goodwill ........................................................................................................................................................... 1,100,737
**Fair value of consideration transferred .........................................................................................................** **$** **2,275,000**

(1) See Note C below for detail of Acquired intangible assets.
(2) See Note D below for detail of Deferred tax liabilities.

The table below summarizes the pro forma adjustment for Goodwill:

**_(In thousands)_** **Amount**
Goodwill ........................................................................................................................................................... $ 1,100,737
Less: AMC Business historical goodwill .......................................................................................................... (868,424)
**Pro forma net adjustment to goodwill ...........................................................................................................** **$** **232,313**

The preliminary purchase accounting was based on an initial valuation in order to identify fair value
allocations of transaction considerations to assets acquired and liabilities assumed including intangible assets
and step-up in the value of property and equipment. Following the consummation of the AMC Acquisition,
a final determination of the fair value of the AMC business’s assets and liabilities will be performed. The
final acquisition consideration allocation may be materially different than that reflected in the preliminary
estimated acquisition consideration allocation presented herein. Any increase or decrease in fair values of the
net assets as compared with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information may change
the amount of the total acquisition consideration allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and
may have a material impact on the combined company’s future results of operations and financial position.

_C._ _Preliminary Identified Intangible Assets_


-----

The preliminary estimated fair value adjustment to the identifiable intangible assets to be acquired in the
Transaction is shown in the table below. The fair value of intangible assets summarized below is preliminary
and subject to change.

**Fair Value of**

**Identifiable**

**_(In thousands)_** **Intangible Assets**

Backlog ........................................................................................................................................................ $ 8,000
Tradename .................................................................................................................................................... 13,000
Developed technology .................................................................................................................................. 365,500
Customer relationships ................................................................................................................................. 1,009,000
**Total identifiable intangible assets ............................................................................................................** **1,395,500**
Less: AMC business historical intangible assets........................................................................................... (6,999)
**Pro forma net adjustment to intangible assets .........................................................................................** $ 1,388,501

_D._ _Deferred Tax Liabilities_

The pro forma adjustment for deferred tax liabilities reflects deferred taxes resulting from pro forma fair
value adjustments related to the acquired intangible assets. Based on the preliminary estimate of intangible
assets by jurisdiction, deferred tax liabilities have been estimated as the book-tax difference by jurisdiction
considering the effective tax rate expected in that jurisdiction. The estimated deferred tax liability resulting
from the fair value adjustments is approximately $100.3 million. Because the tax rates used for the pro forma
financial information are estimated, the estimated blended statutory tax rate by jurisdiction will likely vary
from the actual effective rate in periods subsequent to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition. This
determination is preliminary and subject to change based upon the final determination of the fair value of the
acquired intangible assets.

**Financing Transactions Adjustments**

As described in Note 2 above, the Company plans to consummate the Financing Transactions in connection with the
AMC Acquisition. These Financing Transactions, along with cash on hand, will provide the sources of cash to fund
the AMC Acquisition. The adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are based on preliminary assumptions regarding the structure of planned agreements. Final agreements and overall
structuring of the Financing may result in material changes to these estimates.

_E._ _Long Term Debt_

The following table summarizes the impact of the debt components of the Financing Transactions on the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. As principal repayments
are at maturity, the full amount of the balance is adjusted as a non-current liability:

**_(In thousands)_** **Amount**
Principal balance from the Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities........................................................... $ 1,000,000
Principal balance from the notes offered hereby ............................................................................................... 1,000,000
**Total Principal balance from Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities and the notes offered**

**2,000,000**
**hereby ..........................................................................................................................................................**

New deferred debt issuance costs for Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities and the notes offered

(90,000)
hereby ...........................................................................................................................................................

**Pro Forma adjustment to long term debt ......................................................................................................** $ **1,910,000**

_F._ _Equity Issuance_

Rocket intends to raise $200 million of cash contribution in common equity from certain investment funds
affiliated with Bain Capital along with any additional co-investors designated by Bain Capital (including
existing equityholders of the Company) as part of the funding of the AMC Acquisition as discussed in Note
2. There are no assumed costs related to the issuance of equity.

**Note 5. Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations**


-----

**Transaction Accounting Adjustments**

_AA._ _Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization_

To reflect the estimated fair value of identified tradename, customer relationship and technology intangible
assets acquired and the related amortization for a one year period, as detailed in the table below:

**Amortization**
**Expense for the year**

**ended December 31,**

**_(In thousands)_** **Useful Life (Average)** **Fair Value** **2023**

Backlog ........................................................................ 5 $ 8,000 $ 3,848
Tradename ................................................................... 3 13,000 4,444
Developed technology.................................................. 11-13 365,500 59,165
Customer relationships ................................................. 16 1,009,000 122,407
**Total amortization of intangible assets .....................** **1,395,500** **189,864**
Less: Historical AMC business amortization expense .. 3,045
**Pro forma adjustment for incremental**

**amortization expense .............................................** **$** **186,819**

Backlog, tradename, developed technology and customer relationships are amortized based on the pattern
in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be realized. Amortization expense,
and reduction of revenue for backlog amortization, has been classified in the unaudited condensed
combined statement of operations in accordance with Rocket’s policy.

_BB._ _General and administrative expense_

The general and administrative expense adjustment is comprised of reversal of the AMC business’s sharebased compensation as well as expense incurred for cash-settled awards to conveying the AMC business’s
employees in replacement of the AMC business’s unvested restricted stock units at the time of the AMC
Acquisition. This adjustment is summarized below:


**For the year ended**

**_(In thousands)_** **December 31, 2023**

Cash-settled awards to conveying AMC business employees ........................................................................... $ 5,487
Less: AMC business historical share based compensation ................................................................................ (15,970)
**Pro forma net adjustment to general and administrative ............................................................................** **$** **(10,483)**

_CC._ _Income tax effect of adjustments_

The income tax effects of the transaction adjustments are estimated based on the estimated blended statutory
tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately 22.6%. The actual effective tax rate may
differ materially from the estimates based on factors arising subsequent to the consummation of the AMC
Acquisition.

**Financing Adjustments**

_DD._ _Interest expense related to Financing Transactions_

The following table summarizes the estimated assumed interest expense related to the notes offered hereby
and the Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities. The pro forma adjustment reflects Rocket’s assumptions
related to the terms and pricing of the debt agreements to be finalized in connection with the Financing
Transactions, and such terms and pricing are subject to change.

**Assumed Weighted**

**Average Effective** **For the year ended**

**_(In thousands)_** **Principal Balance** **Interest Rate** **December 31, 2023**

Interest Expense ........................................................... $ 2,000,000 10.81% $ 190,600
Amortization of capitalized debt issuance

costs......................................................................... 16,468


-----

**Assumed Weighted**

**Average Effective** **For the year ended**

**_(In thousands)_** **Principal Balance** **Interest Rate** **December 31, 2023**

**Pro forma net adjustment to Interest and other**

**related expense .......................................................** $ 207,068

Assumed interest expense for the Financing Transactions calculated using an assumed weighted average
effective interest rate of 10.81%. An increase or decrease of 1/8th percent in the interest rate on the
borrowings under the Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities would result in an increase or decrease in
interest expense of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**ROCKET’S MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following management discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations_
_should be read in conjunction with the section of this offering memorandum captioned “Business” and the Company’s_
_audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-_
_looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results and timing of selected events may_
_differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including_
_those discussed under the sections of this offering memorandum captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk_
_Factors.”_

**Overview**

Rocket Software, Inc. is a leading global enterprise software provider with a broad portfolio of products that help
corporations, government agencies and other organizations operate, optimize and modernize their mission-critical IT
infrastructure. The Company’s software solutions run, optimize, and protect customers’ servers and databases, as well
as connect their systems to the rest of the enterprise. The products the Company provides enable customers to carry
out their most mission-critical business functions, such as processing payment transactions at global financial
institutions and maintaining healthcare records at hospitals and insurance companies. Since the Company’s founding
over 30 years ago, the Company has cultivated a customer-centric culture with strategic investments in research and
development that provide a wide range of offerings to continuously meet customers’ evolving needs.

Rocket meets customers wherever they are on their modernization journeys—whether modernizing on premise or
through a hybrid cloud strategy. With over 10,000 global customers, Rocket solves enterprises’ most complex IT
challenges, across infrastructure, data and applications.

**_Recent and Pending Acquisitions_**

On November 28, 2023, Rocket entered into the Acquisition Agreement with OpenText, pursuant to which OpenText
has agreed to divest, directly and indirectly through certain subsidiaries, its AMC business and Rocket has agreed to
purchase the same and generally assume certain liabilities related to the AMC business, as set forth in the Acquisition
Agreement, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments.

On August 31, 2023, Rocket, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Rocket Software Deutschland GmbH, acquired
100% of the equity interest in BOS DigiTec GmbH (“BOS”), a private company based in Munich, Germany for a
purchase price of $17.8 million, net of cash acquired of $4.9 million.

On February 28, 2023, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interest in Key Resources, Inc. (“KRI”) for a
purchase price of $2.2 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million.

The KRI purchase agreement includes contingent payments of up to $4.0 million, payable to two former shareholders
of KRI in annual installments over a three-year period following the closing date, to the extent certain financial
performance and employee retention conditions are met. The Company has determined the contingent payments to be
a post-combination compensation arrangement and will accrue for the expected cost over the period in which the
compensation is considered probable and earned. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has accrued $2.2 million
of expense which is recorded in General and administrative expenses within the statement of operations.

**Key Components of Results of Operations**

The following discussion describes certain line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


-----

**_Revenues_**

The Company generates revenues from the sale of enterprise software products and solutions through branded direct
sales to enterprise customers that help corporations, government agencies and other organizations reach their
technology and business goals. The Company also licenses products to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
partners, predominantly represented by IBM, independent software vendor (“ISV”) partners, reseller partners; to
provide partners and customers solutions, features, and flexibility through service and support businesses; and to
acquire and integrate businesses with similar technology, customers, platforms, and sales channels.

Revenue growth is dependent on the ability to sell software products with maintenance and support. License revenue
consists of products sold on a perpetual or fixed term basis that generally ranges from one to five years. Maintenance
revenue consists of technical support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available unspecified software upgrades.
Maintenance contracts generally have an annual term with optional renewal terms or may be bundled in a fixed term
license arrangement. Subscription revenue consists of several software as a service (“SaaS”) hosted offerings and
OEM royalty revenue. SaaS hosted offerings are sold via a subscription-based model. Professional service revenue
consists primarily of consulting and training services and may be bundled or sold on a stand-alone basis.

**_Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit_**

Cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries, benefits and bonuses for employees directly associated with customer
support, software purchased for resale, and amortization of acquired intangibles for purchased technology. Gross profit
may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by revenue and purchased technology amortization, which
varies based on the timing of acquisitions and the related fair values determined in purchase accounting.

**_Operating Expense_**

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for the design and development of
technology and contractor costs to supplement staff levels. The Company devotes substantial resources to research
and development in an effort to maintain a competitive position. The Company expects that research and development
expense will increase as its business grows, particularly as the Company incurs additional costs related to continued
investments in its platform and products.

**_Sales and Marketing_**

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs directly associated with sales and marketing
staff and commissions. Other sales and marketing costs include marketing programs and promotional events to
promote the Company’s brands. Certain sales commissions earned by the sales force are deferred and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of contract performance or a longer period, generally the expected life of the
customer relationship. The expected customer relationship period is determined based on average historical customer
relationship periods, including expected renewals. Expected renewal periods are only included in the expected
customer relationship period if commission amounts paid upon renewal are not commensurate with amounts paid on
the initial contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs incurred to obtain a contract that
would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company has determined that certain
commissions programs meet the requirements to be deferred. The Company groups similar contracts based on revenue
and customer type and amortizes commissions on a systemic basis over the average contract length or expected
customer life.

**_General and Administrative_**

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for executive, finance, legal, human
resources, IT, and administrative personnel, professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting and other
consulting services, facility costs, and depreciation of property and equipment. These expenses also include
management fees payable to Bain Capital Private Equity, LP.


-----

**_Amortization of Other Acquired Intangible Assets_**

Amortization of other acquired intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization of acquired intangible assets,
excluding amortization of purchased technology and backlog. Amortization may vary from quarter to quarter and is
primarily affected by acquired intangible assets, which varies based on the timing of acquisitions and the related fair
values determined in purchase accounting.

**_Non-Operating Expenses_**

**_Interest Expense_**

Interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest expense on long-term debt, including senior notes, a first
lien term loan, a first lien revolving line of credit, acquired debt from the 2019 acquisition of Sixon Holding SA, and
the amortization of debt issuance costs. As discussed in _Note 15, Derivatives, to the audited consolidated financial_
statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swaps and caps
for a portion of debt, and the realized gains or losses from those derivatives are recorded as a component of interest
expense. The Company expects interest expense to decrease when indebtedness is repaid or when interest rate fall.
The Company expects interest expense to increase when indebtedness is borrowed and when interest rates rise.

**_Other Income (Expense), Net_**

Other income (expense), net consists primarily of gains and losses on sale of investments, foreign currency
transactions and remeasurements, and remeasurements or settlements of non-hedge designated derivative instruments.
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. With respect to non-U.S. subsidiaries, the functional currency
is the local currency.

**_Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes_**

Provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of US federal, state, and foreign income taxes related to the jurisdictions
in which the Company operates. Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
for deferred tax assets that, based on currently available evidence, may not be realized. The Company records a liability
associated with an uncertain tax position if it is determined that there is not a more likely than not possibility of
sustaining such benefit upon audit by the taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. The Company
records a tax benefit of a position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement.

General and administrative expenses increased by $16.9 million, or 11.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to acquisition-related costs, debt
modification costs and expenses relating to legal matters.

**_Restructuring Plans_**

In December 2023, the Company announced its decision to exit its operations in China as a broader initiative to colocate many of its application modernization products at the Company’s development centers located in Vilnius,
Lithuania; Pune, India; and Bentonville, Arkansas.

The estimated cost of the program is $16.0 to $18.0 million and it is expected to be completed in early 2025. The
Company recorded $7.3 million of employee-related restructuring costs within operating expenses in the fourth quarter
of 2023. The plan is not expected to generate savings.

In July 2023, the Company’s management approved a plan to reduce its global workforce by approximately 5%. The
plan was substantially completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 at a cost of $6.4 million. Upon
completion of the plan, the Company expects to generate approximately $14.0 million of annualized savings.

During 2021, the Company announced a global reorganization and facilities consolidation plan to reduce redundancies
and achieve synergies relating to the integration of the Company’s acquisitions of M4 Global Solutions Holding
Coöperatief U.A. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Uniface B.V. (collectively, “Uniface”) and ASG Everglades
Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, ASG Technologies Holdings, Inc., ASG Technologies Group, Inc.
(collectively, “ASG”). The total cost of the plan was $57.2 million and was completed in the second quarter of 2023.
The plan included restructuring-related costs such as employee severance, other employee-related costs, asset
impairments and accelerated depreciation, facility exit costs as well as consulting fees relating to integrations. The
Company expects to generate approximately $50.0 million of annualized savings.

Total other income (expense), net decreased by $69.3 million, or 56.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This change from the prior year was primarily due to lower realized
and unrealized gains on non-hedge designated derivative contracts and foreign currency remeasurement and an
increase in interest expense due to rising interest rates, partially offset by gain on investment in Software AG and
interest income from cash and cash equivalents.

Benefit from income taxes decreased by $8.0 million, or 47.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the change in the amount and geographical mix of the income
(loss) before provision for income taxes, the increase in valuation allowance related to the U.S. interest expense
carryforward deferred tax asset, the increase in liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, the change in state
deferred tax rates, and increase in foreign derived intangibles income tax incentives.

The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were 8% and 35%,
respectively. The effective tax rate in 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits
related to the state income tax provision, tax incentives related to research and development and foreign derived
intangible income, partially offset by the increase in valuation allowance, the increase in liabilities for uncertain tax
benefits, the inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income, foreign branch and withholding taxes, and by income
taxed in foreign jurisdictions with a tax rate different than that of the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2022 differed from
the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits related to the state income tax provision, tax incentives related
to research and development and foreign derived intangible income, and benefits related to the decrease in liabilities
for uncertain tax benefits; partially offset by the inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income, foreign branch and
withholding taxes, and by income taxed in foreign jurisdictions with a tax rate different than that of the U.S.

Total revenue increased by $7.3 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a full year of revenue from the Company’s
acquisitions of Uniface and ASG in 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by the recognition of license
revenue from a large multi-year contract in the prior year period that did not repeat in the current year. Uniface was
acquired on February 3, 2021 and ASG was acquired on May 20, 2021. As such, only a portion of Uniface and ASG
revenue was included in the prior year period.

General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by synergies realized in the
current year related to the acquisitions of ASG and Uniface, partially offset by the additional costs associated with the
timing of the ASG and Uniface acquisitions.

**_Restructuring Plans_**

During 2021, the Company began executing a global reorganization and facilities consolidation plan to reduce
redundancies and achieve synergies relating to the integration of the Company’s acquisitions of Uniface and ASG.
The total estimated cost of the plan is $55 to $60 million of which $54.1 million has been incurred to date through
December 31, 2022. The plan includes restructuring-related costs such as employee severance, other employee-related
costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, facility exit costs as well as consulting fees relating to
integrations. The majority of the cost of the plan is expected to be incurred by March 31, 2023.

The plan was expected to generate $45 to $50 million of annualized savings, the majority of which has been realized
as of December 31, 2022.

Benefit from income taxes increased by $13.0 million, or 341.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the change in the amount and geographical mix of the income
(loss) before provision for income taxes, and the resulting impact on the state income tax provision; partially offset
by the decrease in tax benefit resulting from expiring statute of limitation on liabilities related to unrecognized tax
benefits.

The effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 35% and -67%,
respectively. The effective tax rate in 2022 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits
related to the state income tax provision, tax incentives related to research and development and foreign derived
intangible income, and benefits related to the decrease in liabilities for uncertain tax benefits; partially offset by the
inclusion of global intangible low-taxed income, foreign branch and withholding taxes, and by income taxed in foreign
jurisdictions with a tax rate different than that of the U.S. The effective tax rate in 2021 differed from the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits related to the decrease in liabilities for uncertain tax benefits, and tax incentives
related to research and development and foreign derived intangible income; partially offset by foreign branch and
withholding taxes, and the deferred tax impact resulting from increases in statutory tax rates in the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

Cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of bank deposits and money market funds held with global
relationship banks. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $239.0 million and $157.8 million,
respectively, of unrestricted cash. These amounts do not include restricted cash, which primarily represents deposits
on lease facilities and are included in prepaid expense, other current assets, and other assets. The Company had net
working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) of $136.4 million, $88.3 million and ($3.9) million
as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The primary sources of liquidity include existing unrestricted cash, cash flow generated from operations, and
borrowings from the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $151.7
million available for additional borrowings under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, after giving effect
to $1.2 million of letters of credit issued thereunder.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash requirements of $215.0 million for estimated interest payments over
the next 12 months. The Company also has cash requirements related to principal debt obligation and lease payments.
See Note 10, Long-Term Debt and Note 11, Leases to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum for a description of long-term debt obligations and lease commitments, respectively.
The Company anticipates using existing cash and proceeds from operating cash flows to fund these expenditures.

Liquidity needs primarily include meeting debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital
expenditures. The Company may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that may impact future cash
requirements. There are certain factors that may negatively impact available sources of funds in the future including
the ability to generate cash from operations and borrow on debt facilities. The amount of cash generated from
operations is dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of business strategies and general economic
conditions. The amount of cash available for borrowings under various debt facilities is dependent on the ability to
maintain sufficient collateral and general financial conditions in the marketplace.

million of depreciation and amortization.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $114.4 million, primarily due to a
net loss of $32.4 million and addbacks of non-cash expenses, the largest of which was $230.6 million of depreciation

**Debt Obligations**

**_Existing Credit Facilities_**

On November 28, 2018, in connection with the completion of Bain Capital’s acquisition of the Company, the
Company entered into a credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada (as successor to Credit Suisse AG, Cayman
Islands Branch), as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, which, as amended through December 31,
2023, provides for (i) a first lien term loan in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,410 million in U.S.
dollar-denominated term loans (the “Existing Dollar Term Loan”) and an aggregate principal amount of €575 million
Euro-denominated term loans (after giving effect to amortization payments made prior to the date hereof) (the
“Existing Euro Term Loan” and, together with the Existing Dollar Term Loan, the “Existing First Lien Term Loans”),
and (ii) a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $152.9 million (the “Existing
First Lien Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Existing First Lien Term Loans, the Incremental First
Lien Term Loan Facilities (as described elsewhere) and the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, the “Senior
Secured Credit Facilities”). As of December 31, 2023, the Existing Dollar Term Loan had a balance of $1,403.9
million and the Existing Euro Term Loan, translated in U.S. dollars, had an outstanding balance of $635.2 million. As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had $152.9 million in borrowings available under the Existing First Lien
Revolving Credit Facility (without giving effect to $1 million of letters of credit issued thereunder).

Under the terms of the Existing Dollar Term Loan, the principal amount is paid in quarterly installments equal to 1.0%
of the original principal amount per annum until the final maturity date, when the remaining principal is due and
monthly floating interest rate payments are made based on the one-month SOFR rate. The interest rate per annum
applicable to the Existing Dollar Term Loan is the adjusted SOFR rate (with a minimum of 0.50% per annum) plus
4.75%.

Under the terms of the Existing Euro Term Loan, the Company will make monthly floating interest rate payments
based on the one-month EURIBOR rate. The interest rate per annum applicable to the Existing Euro Term Loan is the
adjusted EURIBOR rate (with a minimum of 0.00% per annum) plus 4.75%.


-----

The interest rate per annum applicable to borrowings under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is, at the
option of the Company, the adjusted SOFR rate plus 3.25% or the alternative base rate plus 2.25%, with step-downs
to (i) the adjusted SOFR rate plus 3.125% or the alternative base rate plus 2.125%, as applicable, and (ii) the adjusted
SOFR rate plus 3.00% or the alternative base rate plus 2.00%, as applicable, in each case based on achieving certain
First Lien Net Leverage Ratios, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans and
the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility.

The credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that
requires compliance with a maximum First Lien Net Leverage Ratio of 7.70 to 1.00 if, on the last day of any quarter,
the amount of borrowings under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 35% of the aggregate
outstanding revolving commitments. The covenant did not apply to the Company as of December 31, 2023. The
Existing First Lien Term Loans and the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility contain certain mandatory
prepayment requirements, including, with respect to the Existing First Lien Term Loans, 50% (with step downs to
25% and 0% based on achieving certain leverage ratios) of annual excess cash flow greater than $15.0 million in any
fiscal year. See also “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_RSD Debt_**

As of August 16, 2019, the Company assumed indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Sixon Holding SA
(the “RSD Debt”). Pursuant to the credit agreement governing the RSD Debt, dated September 19, 2018, the RSD
Debt consists of a CHF 17.5 million senior amortizing term loan facility and a CHF 17.5 million senior non-amortizing
(bullet) term loan facility. The amortizing term loan facility is subject to mandatory repayments of CHF 3.2 million,
payable annually on December 31st through 2022, with a final payment of CHF 3.2 million due on March 28, 2024
(which payment was made). The non-amortizing term loan facility, which consists of U.S. dollar-denominated
facilities and Euro-denominated facilities, has a maturity date of September 28, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the
outstanding amount, translated into U.S. dollars, under the RSD Debt was $19.7 million.

The interest rate per annum applicable to the U.S. dollar-denominated facilities is, at the option of the Company, the
adjusted SOFR rate plus the Alternative Reference Rates Committee spread plus a blended rate of 2.6%.

The interest rate per annum applicable to the Euro-denominated facilities is, at the option of the Company, the adjusted
EURIBOR rate plus a blended rate of 2.4%.

**_2021 Senior Notes_**

On February 2, 2021, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Uniface, the Company issued $575.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Existing Notes”).

The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes, together with cash on hand, (i) to finance and
consummate the acquisition of Uniface, (ii) to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness and accrued interest under
the second lien term loan, (iii) to pay down all then outstanding borrowings under the Existing First Lien Revolving
Credit Facility, (iv) to pay transaction expenses and fees and (v) for other general corporate purposes.

The Existing Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per year. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The Existing Notes have a maturity date of February
15, 2029.

For further information, see _Note 10, Long Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included_
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Derivatives – Interest Rate Swaps**

On January 10, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the rate on $1,015.0 million of
the then-outstanding balance of $1,300.0 million under the Existing First Lien Term Loans. The Company pays a


-----

blended fixed rate of 2.51% per annum and receives floating rate interest at December 31, 2023. These swaps have
maturity dates of January 31, 2024.

The interest rate swaps, designated for hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes
in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. The notional amount of these transactions was
$1,015.0 million and had a fair value of $2.4 million, $24.6 million and $(35.7) million as of December 31, 2023,
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

On August 12, 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of
November 28, 2025, to fix the rate on a portion of floating-rate debt. The rate is fixed at 5.23% per annum at December
31, 2023. The counterparty pays floating-rate interest plus a 4.29% spread.

The interest rate swap, designated for hedge accounting, is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in
the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. The notional amount of this transaction was $150.0
million and had a fair value asset of $8.7 million, $13.3 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023, December
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

**Derivatives – Interest Rate Caps**

On August 12, 2021, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements, one denominated in U.S. dollars and
one in Euro, to cap the interest rate on a portion of U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated floating-rate debt. The
agreements have a maturity date of August 31, 2024. The interest rate is capped at 1.5% per annum for the U.S. dollardenominated instrument and at 0.0% per annum for the Euro-denominated instrument at December 31, 2023.

The interest rate caps, designated for hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in
the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. The notional amounts of these transactions were €300.0
million and $154.0 million and had a fair value of $10.7 million, $23.2 million and $1.5 million as of December 31,
2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2021, the Company acquired an interest rate cap agreement through the ASG acquisition. The
agreement has matured as of October 31, 2023. The debt to which the interest rate cap related was paid off at the
acquisition date.

The interest rate cap, not designated for hedge accounting, is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes
in the fair value are recognized in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The notional
amount of this transaction was $200.0 million and had a fair value of $0.0 million, $6.3 million and $0.8 million as of
December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

**Derivatives – Cross-currency Swaps**

On August 12, 2021, the Company entered into two cross-currency swap agreements: one agreement to protect a
designated amount of the Company’s net investment in Rocket Software UK International, a British pound-functionalcurrency consolidated subsidiary (the British pound-U.S. dollar instrument) and one to cover the income-statement
exposure to Euro foreign exchange fluctuations (the Euro-U.S. dollar instrument). The agreements have a maturity
date of November 28, 2025.

In conjunction with the amendment to its credit agreements that occurred on October 5, 2023, the Company settled
and unwound its Euro-U.S. dollar instrument in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in cash proceeds of $37.1 million.
This gain has been recognized in Other income (expense) over the life of the contract through mark to market. The
Company recognized a gain of $2.4 million and $32.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively.

Both cross-currency swap agreements are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The British pound-U.S. dollar
instrument is designated as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive
income. The Euro-U.S. dollar instrument is not designated as a hedge and changes in fair value are recognized in


-----

Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The notional amounts of these transactions, as of
December 31, 2023 were £108.5 million and €0.0 million and had a fair value of $11.2 million. The notional amounts
of these transactions, as of December 31, 2022 were £108.5 million and €191.8 million and had a fair value of $58.9
million. The notional amounts of these transactions, as of December 31, 2021 were £108.5 million and $191.8 million
and had a fair value of $10.6 million.

For the British pound-U.S. dollar instrument, the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.4% on the British pound leg of the
contract and the counterparty pays the Company a fixed rate of 5.23% on the notional U.S. dollar amount of $150.0
million.

Prior to the settlement of the Euro-U.S. dollar instrument, the Company paid a fixed rate of 4.16% on the Euro leg of
the contract and the counterparty paid the Company floating-rate interest plus a 4.25% spread on the notional U.S.
dollar amount of $225.0 million.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including
entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates**

The audited consolidated financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect
reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
Judgments are based on historical experience and other relevant and reasonable assumptions. Actual results may differ
from estimates as such estimates may change as additional information is acquired or as circumstances change.

A comprehensive disclosure of significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Basis of Presentation, Summary
_of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements included in the notes to audited_
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company believes that the
accounting policies that require significant management judgement and estimates are as follows:

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash_**

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes security deposits to the lessors of certain office locations in
the form of certificates of deposit with a bank. The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(dollars in thousands) **December 31,**

**2023** **2022**
Cash and cash equivalents ......................................................................................................................... $ 238,966 $ 157,809
Restricted cash short-term – Included in other current assets .................................................................... 504 554
Restricted cash long-term – Included in other long-term assets ................................................................. 1,762 2,433

**_Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses_**

Accounts receivable are stated as the amount the Company’s management expects to collect from outstanding
balances. Management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables will potentially
be uncollectible. The Company reserves for receivables that are determined to be uncollectible, if any, in its allowance
for credit losses. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of customers, historical experience, the age of the
receivable and current market and economic conditions. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
receivable is written off against the allowance.

The following is a roll-forward of the Company’s allowance for credit losses (in thousands):


-----

**Charged to**

**Balance Beginning** **Statement of** **Balance at End of**

**of Period** **Operations** **Deductions (1)** **Period**

**Allowance for credit losses**
Year ended December 31, 2023 908 435 299 1,660
Year ended December 31, 2022 2,493 (431) (1,154) 908

(1) Deductions included actual accounts written-off, net of recoveries.

**_Acquisitions_**

The Company accounts for business acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination using the
acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration transferred in a business
combination, including any contingent consideration, is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business combination are
accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired based on their relative
fair values without recognizing goodwill. Significant judgments are used in determining fair values of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. Fair value and intangible asset useful life determinations are based on, among other factors,
estimates of future expected cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty cost savings and appropriate discount rates
used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating the
purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Company’s current and future operating results.
Actual results may vary from these estimates which may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair
values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair
values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the
measurement period are recorded within the Company’s operating results.

**_Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets_**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets consist of technology, customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames,
and backlog. Other long-lived assets generally consist of property and equipment.

The Company’s intangible assets, other than backlog and those intangible assets classified as indefinite-lived, as well
as the Company’s property and equipment, are depreciated or amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives,
or lease term, on a pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets
that are amortized to expense have estimated useful lives that range from eight to twenty-one years. Backlog is
amortized, as a reduction of revenue, on a specific identification basis following the recognition of the revenue of the
underlying contracts. Amortization of intangible assets charged to cost of revenue and operating expense for the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $207.0 million and $206.9 million, respectively. Backlog amortization
expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was $6.2 million and $9.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators
of impairment. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, or more frequently
when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. In assessing qualitative
factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying
amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a
reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include
the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial
performance, events which are specific to the Company, and trends in the fair value of the Company’s common stock.
Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude
of any such impact.


-----

The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company, whose management
uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has
determined that it has one reporting unit.

The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 on the single reporting
unit and concluded that goodwill had not been impaired.

Similar to the evaluation of those long-lived assets that are not amortized, the Company evaluates amortizable
intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the
assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment
loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds
expected from disposition of the assets, if any, are less than the carrying value of the assets. If an asset or asset group
is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss, if any, represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s
carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Each period, the Company also evaluates the estimated remaining
useful life of its long-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a
revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization.

A considerable amount of judgment is required in performing an impairment analysis, principally in determining
discount rates, and financial forecasts. Unanticipated changes in market conditions could have a material impact on
the Company’s projected cash flows. Differences in actual cash flows as compared to the projected cash flows, as well
as changes in market conditions, could require the Company to record additional impairment losses in the future.

**_ASC 606 Revenue Recognition_**

The guidance states that if an arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, each distinct performance
obligation is accounted for separately. Subsequently, the Company recognizes revenue through the application of the
following steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations
in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to performance
obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The
Company’s policy does not permit a right of return.

_Non-OEM Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Accounts Receivable, and Deferred Revenue_

The Company’s software licenses are primarily on-premise and fully functional when made available to the customer.
As the customer can use and benefit from the license on its own, on-premise software licenses represent distinct
performance obligations. Revenue for software licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when a license key
is delivered to a customer, and the customer may use and benefit from the license. These licenses are sold as perpetual
or for a fixed term.

Perpetual licenses are generally invoiced upon execution of the contract. Term licenses are generally invoiced upfront
or on an annual basis over the term of the arrangement, which generally range from one to five years. Any difference
between the license revenue recognized and the amount invoiced to the customer is accounted for on the consolidated
balance sheets as unbilled accounts receivable.

The Company’s maintenance service consists of technical support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available unspecified
software upgrades. As these maintenance services are considered to be a series of distinct services that are substantially
the same and have the same duration and measure of progress, the Company concludes that they represent one
combined performance obligation. Maintenance revenue is therefore recognized ratably over the contract period. Any
difference between the maintenance amount invoiced or collected and the maintenance revenue recognized is
accounted for on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue.

Professional services primarily include consulting and training services. In general, services are distinct performance
obligations. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are delivered to the customer. The Company


-----

applies the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing for time and materials-based arrangements as
the invoiced amount corresponds to the value of the services provided.

The Company also sells several SaaS hosted offerings. These SaaS offerings are sold via a subscription-based model.
Customers can use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of it and the services are
available to them throughout the entire term, even if they do not use the service. As the services related to this model
are indistinct from one another and have the same duration and measure of progress, revenue related to these offerings
is recognized ratably over the contract period. SaaS arrangements are generally invoiced on a monthly or quarterly
basis over the term of the arrangement.

As part of the review over the transaction price, the Company considers whether there are any variable fees, such as
usage-based arrangements, or price concessions that may give rise to variable consideration. Revenue related to
variable consideration is recorded at the time of the transfer of licenses or services to its customers.

Significant judgment is required in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company utilizes observable inputs when
they exist, such as for maintenance renewals on historical perpetual license sales, and for SaaS hosted arrangements.
The standalone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically the standalone selling prices for software
licenses, are highly variable. In these instances, the Company estimates a narrow range of standalone selling prices
using observable pricing information, such as the Company’s existing price list and historical sales data.

When bundled term license and maintenance sales occur, the Company bifurcates the transaction into its two separate
performance obligations, and then allocates the transaction value accordingly. The Company’s allocation between the
term license and maintenance performance obligations is calculated based upon the observable relationship of the
selling price of a standalone maintenance renewal to the related perpetual license fee, which is generally 20% of the
net license fee for one year of maintenance. The Company considers using the observable relationship between a
perpetual license fee and a standalone maintenance renewal to be appropriate for allocating value within a bundled
arrangement because the nature of the respective performance obligations and the rights transferred to the customer
are similar.

As part of the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations, the Company considers the presence
of any material rights or specified future upgrades that could represent additional performance obligations. The
Company did not identify any material right performance obligations in the periods presented.

_OEM Revenue Recognition_

Consistent with ASC 606, the Company recognizes royalty revenue to which it is entitled in the period in which it is
earned. The Company utilizes customer information and other sources of information to determine the most likely
estimate of royalty revenue to be recognized and accrued each period. As a management estimate, the determination
of sales based royalty revenue requires significant judgment. In the event of any material difference between the
estimate and the actual royalty received, the Company will record an adjustment in the period the revenue was earned.

**_Deferred Commissions_**

The Company’s incremental costs of obtaining a contract which consist of sales commissions, are deferred, and
amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period, generally the expected life of the customer
relationship. The expected customer relationship period is determined based on average historical customer
relationship periods, including expected renewals. Expected renewal periods are only included in the expected
customer relationship period if commission amounts paid upon renewal are not commensurate with amounts paid on
the initial contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the Company incurs to obtain a
contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company groups similar contracts
based on revenue and customer type and amortizes on a systemic basis over the average contract length or expected
customer life.

**_Qualitative Risks to Revenue Recognition_**


-----

Because a portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the U.S., there exists the risk of exposure to
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. International sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies, and
changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect revenue results. However,
as most of the Company’s revenue comes from North American entities that operate in U.S. dollars, this is not deemed
to be a significant risk.

The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments
and agencies. These customers operate based upon allocated budgets and appropriations. In the event that a
government or agency enters into a multi-year contract and does not receive its expected allocated budget, it is possible
that the existing contract could be terminated. However, the Company’s standard practice is for any multi-year contract
to contain a substantive termination penalty, which provides evidence of enforceable rights and obligations throughout
the stated contract term. Therefore, this is not seen to be a significant risk to revenue recognition.

**_Income Taxes_**

Deferred income taxes represent differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the Company’s assets
and liabilities and for tax net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect
in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company calculates and recognizes deferred tax
assets and liabilities based on expected future tax consequences of these temporary differences. Valuation allowances
are calculated for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on currently available evidence, may not be realized.

For uncertain tax positions, the Company records a liability associated with an uncertain tax position if the Company
determines that there is not a more likely than not possibility of sustaining such benefit upon audit by the taxing
authority based on the technical merits of the position. The Company records a tax benefit of a position as the largest
amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This process
involves significant judgments on the part of management.

**_Research and Development and External Capitalized Software Development Costs_**

In accordance with ASC 730, the Company expenses costs associated with the development of computer software for
external use as incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility. The Company has determined that
technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved
through coding and testing. Costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the
general release of the products are capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, software costs that
were eligible for capitalization have been immaterial, and as a result, no costs have been capitalized.

**_Capitalized Internal-Use Software_**

The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, “Internal-Use
Software.” The Company capitalizes costs for software to be used internally when entering the application
development stage. This occurs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits
to funding the project, and it is feasible that the project will be completed, and the software will perform the intended
function. The Company ceases to capitalize costs related to a software project when it enters the post-implementation
and operation stage. If different determinations are made with respect to the state of development of a software project,
then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially.

Costs capitalized during the application development stage consist of payroll and related costs for employees who are
directly associated with, and who devote time directly to, a project to develop software for internal use. The Company
also capitalizes the direct costs of materials and services, which generally includes outside contractors, and interest.
The Company does not capitalize any general and administrative or overhead costs or costs incurred during the
application development stage related to training or data conversion costs. Costs related to upgrades and enhancements
to internal-use software, if those upgrades and enhancements result in additional functionality, are capitalized. If
upgrades and enhancements do not result in additional functionality, those costs are expensed as incurred. If different
determinations are made with respect to whether upgrades or enhancements to software projects would result in


-----

additional functionality, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ
materially.

The Company amortizes capitalized costs with respect to development projects for internal-use software when the
software is ready for use. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized using the straight-line
method over a 3-year period. In determining and reassessing the estimated useful life over which the cost incurred for
the software should be amortized, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and
other economic factors.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 capitalized software development costs were $7.0 million and $7.9 million,
respectively. Additions, relating to capitalized software development costs, incurred during the years ended December
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively.

**_Leases_**

The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease
components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion, on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet.

Operating leases with a duration of 12 months or less are excluded from ROU assets and operating lease liabilities
and related expenses are recorded as incurred.

ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease
liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease
commencement date. The lease ROU asset includes any initial direct costs incurred and is reduced for tenant
incentives. As the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum
lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. To determine the estimated
incremental borrowing rate, the Company performs a synthetic credit rating analysis and uses publicly available credit
ratings for peer companies based upon the determined synthetic credit rating analysis. The Company estimates the
incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of the ROU assets for possible impairment in accordance with the longlived assets policy above.

Lease expense for minimum lease payments for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Improvement reimbursements from landlords are amortized through ROU assets on a straight-line basis as a
reduction to rent expense over the terms of the corresponding leases.

**_Asset Retirement Obligations_**

The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC Topic 410, “Asset Retirement and
Environmental Obligations”, which applies to certain obligations associated with “leasehold improvements” within
leased office facilities. ASC Topic 410 requires that a liability be initially recognized for the estimated fair value of
the obligation when it is incurred. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of
the long-lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the associated liability is
accreted to the estimated fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic accretion charges which
are generally recorded within “General and administrative” expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income. When the obligation is settled, any difference between the final cost and the
recorded amount is recognized as income or loss on settlement in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Accounting_**


-----

Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their functional
currency. Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these
transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gain (loss) reflected in
“Other income (expenses), net” for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $(25.1) million and $11.6
million, respectively.

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.
dollars at current exchange rates, while revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during
each reporting period. The resulting currency translation gain (loss) are included in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

**_Comprehensive Income (Loss)_**

Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from nonowner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) consists of the net income (loss), foreign
currency translation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net, and is reported within the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

Other income (expense) includes interest income, gains and losses on long-lived asset disposals, gains and losses on
derivative instruments not designated for hedging, gains on investments, losses on early retirement of debt, and
realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

See _Note 2, Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting_
_Pronouncements in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023_
and 2022 for a full description and discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

The Company is exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that
may impact financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Market risk exposure is
primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, customer concentrations and interest rates. The
Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

**Foreign Currency Exchange Risk**

Approximately 15% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were earned in non-U.S. dollar denominated
currencies, principally the Euro, British pound, and Australian Dollar. Expenses are generally denominated in the
currencies in which operations are located, primarily the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent the British pound, Euro,
and Indian Rupee. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign
exchange rates. The Company may use derivative contracts, including currency swaps, in an effort to mitigate the risk
of foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, natural hedging exists in several currencies
where the Company has revenue and expenses including the four largest exposure currencies: Euro, British pound,
Australian dollar and Japanese yen. However, these hedges do not completely eliminate foreign exchange risk and


-----

therefore changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could have a
material impact on cash flows and net income (loss).

**Interest Rate Risk**

The Company has unrestricted cash of $239.0 million and $157.8 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. Cash balances are held at highly rated banks within highly liquid bank deposits and money market
funds. The Company does not believe cash deposits have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While the Company
believes cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, the Company cannot provide absolute assurance that in the
future cash will not be subject to adverse changes in the credit profile of those banks. In addition, the Company
maintains significant amounts of cash at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits.
The Company cannot be assured that it will not experience losses on these deposits.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to variable-rate debt it has issued or borrowed, including debt
under the Existing First Lien Term Loans and the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. The Company issues
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. The
Company may use interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to obtain a
fixed interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of floating for fixed interest payments.
However, the Company may choose not to swap floating for fixed interest payments or may terminate a previously
executed swap if the Company believes a larger proportion of variable-rate debt would be beneficial.

**Client Relationship with IBM**

A significant portion of revenue is derived from a partnership agreement with IBM, whereby IBM licenses software
products on an OEM basis and pays a royalty based on IBM’s recorded license, maintenance and subscription revenue.
IBM is responsible for sales and marketing (i.e. “go-to-market”) of IBM-branded products. The Company derives a
significant portion of revenue from a long-term strategic partnership with IBM and a termination of this partnership
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**Inflation**

The Company recognizes that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the Company through higher labor
and other operating costs. The Company tries to minimize these impacts through effective control of operating
expenses and productivity improvements, as well as price increases to customers. The Company does not believe that
inflation has had a material effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if costs
were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, the Company may not be able to fully offset such higher
costs. The inability or failure to do so could harm the business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Overview**

The AMC business includes historically a product group of Micro Focus and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OT
Connectivity business, a product group of OpenText. OpenText acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital
of Micro Focus on January 31, 2023 as part of the MF Acquisition. For the period starting January 1, 2022 to the date
of the MF Acquisition, reference to the “Parent” is to Micro Focus. For the period after the MF Acquisition starting
on February 1, 2023, reference to the “Parent” is to OpenText. The audited combined carveout financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been prepared on a “carve-out” basis. The periods presented
were prepared on a standalone basis and have been derived from the accounting records of Micro Focus prior to the
MF Acquisition and OpenText following the MF Acquisition. The audited combined carveout financial statements
herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Prior to the date of the MF Acquisition, the accounting records
and financial information of Micro Focus were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”) and had a different fiscal year end. In
preparing the audited combined carveout financial statements, the AMC business presents a fiscal period ended
December 31 and has converted any financial information to GAAP. Please see Note 1, Organization and Basis of
_Presentation to the audited combined carveout financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum_
for more information on how the audited combined carveout financial statements have been prepared.

**_Impacts of Geopolitical Conflicts and Diplomatic Tensions_**

The AMC business continues to monitor the geopolitical conflicts and diplomatic tensions around the world, including
the Israel-Hamas war. The AMC business continues to operate its Israeli-based business and support the employees
of the AMC business in the region. While operations affected by these locations are not material and there is not an
expectation that these geopolitical conflicts will have a material adverse effect on the overall business, results of
operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of these conflicts, including
adverse effects on the global economy, on the AMC business and operations as well as those of the AMC business’s
customers, partners and third-party service providers.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The AMC business has identified the following accounting estimates as critical to its business operations and the
understanding of the AMC business’s results of operations. The preparation of the audited combined carveout financial
statements requires The AMC business to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the audited combined carveout financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. While The AMC business
does not believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that actual results will
not differ from these estimates.

The AMC business’s accounting policies are described in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation and Note 2,
_Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited combined carveout financial statements included elsewhere_
in this offering memorandum. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with _Note 2, Summary of_
_Significant Accounting Policies, as it presents uncertainties involved in applying the accounting policies and provides_
insight into the quality of the management of the AMC business’s estimates and variability in the amounts recorded
for these critical accounting estimates. The AMC business’s critical accounting estimates include the following:

**_Revenue Recognition_**

In accordance with ASC 606, the AMC business accounts for a customer contract when the AMC business obtains
written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the
contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as,
control of a promised product or service is transferred to the AMC business’s customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration the AMC business expects to be entitled to in exchange for products and services (at its transaction
price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the
transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted
information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and
circumstances of each arrangement. The AMC business reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by
governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions. The AMC
business has three revenue streams: customer support, licenses and professional services.


-----

**_Goodwill_**

Impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. To
determine if goodwill is potentially impaired, the AMC business has the option to perform a qualitative assessment.
However, the AMC business may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment
test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist.

The process of estimating the fair value of goodwill is subjective and requires the AMC business to make estimates
that may significantly impact the outcome of the analysis. Under the qualitative assessment, the AMC business
considers several qualitative factors, including the business enterprise value of the reporting unit and the excess of fair
value over carrying value from this test, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the recent
and projected financial performance of the reporting unit, cost factors, as well as other factors.

The AMC business has concluded that there is one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this
reporting unit. On December 31, 2023, and 2022, the AMC business performed its qualitative impairment test for
goodwill which indicated that the fair value for the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, and therefore did not
result in a goodwill impairment. Refer to the Goodwill discussion in _Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting_
_Policies to the audited combined carveout financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for_
additional information.

**_Corporate Allocations_**

The audited combined carveout financial statements have been prepared on a “carve-out” basis and include an
allocated share of costs related to Parent corporate functions for certain services provided to the AMC business.
Expenses are allocated to the AMC business based on utilization or other metrics deemed reasonable and appropriate
by the management of the AMC business (e.g., revenue or headcount). As such, the audited combined carveout
financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect the
AMC business’s results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows, had it been a
standalone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the AMC business
had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organization structure and various other
strategic decisions. Refer to Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation to the audited combined carveout financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income tax benefit (provision) represents the income tax benefit or expense associated with the AMC business’s
operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the AMC business operates. Foreign jurisdictions in
which the AMC business operates have different statutory tax rates. The AMC business did not operate as a standalone
entity in the past and, accordingly, tax losses, receivables and other deferred tax assets included in the audited
combined carveout financial statements on a separate return basis may not be available upon separation of the AMC
business from Parent.

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases between financial reporting and income
tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which
those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. AMC records valuation allowances to reduce the
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Separately, tax positions taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The AMC business’s effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses
in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences, certain one-time items and changes in tax
contingencies. Refer to _Note 10, Income Taxes in the audited combined carveout financial statements included_
elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further discussion.

**Results of Operations**


-----

The following tables provide a detailed analysis of the AMC business’s results of operations and financial condition.
For each of the periods indicated below, the AMC business presents revenues by product type, revenues by major
geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product
type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue.

The comparability of the AMC business’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the year ended
December 31, 2022 was impacted by the addition of OT Connectivity to the AMC business on February 1, 2023. Total
revenues increased by $59.3 million across all product types in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year
ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to revenue contributions from the addition of OT Connectivity and growth
in license revenue of $7.9 million with related customer support revenue and professional service revenue increases
of $7.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The addition of OT Connectivity contributed $37.9 million to total
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $26.6 million related to customer support revenues and
$11.3 million related to license revenues.

Total cost of revenues increased by $16.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year ended
December 31, 2022, which is comprised of an increase in the AMC business’s direct costs of $11.6 million, allocated
shared corporate costs of $3.8 million, and additional direct costs of $1.2 million as a result of the MF Acquisition
and addition of that business. Of the total $16.6 million increase, $15.7 million was driven by labor-related and
consulting costs. The increase in labor-related costs were caused by a reorganization of the go-to-market operations
of Micro Focus during the second half of 2022, which resulted in an increase in the dedicated AMC business customer
support headcount, an investment in increasing the professional service consultants in the AMC business, and the MF
Acquisition and addition of that business. The consulting costs increase was driven by an increase in outsourcing costs
following a transition from internal to outsourced support for first line customer support implemented in the second
half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 as well as increased use of contracting resources to support professional service
projects during 2023.

Total operating expenses increased by $60.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, relative to the year ended
December 31, 2022, which is comprised of additional research and development, sales and marketing, and general
and administrative allocated shared corporate costs of $29.0 million, the AMC business’s direct expenses of $26.0
million and $5.7 million of direct costs associated with the addition of OT Connectivity.

**_Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type_**

**_Customer Support_**

Customer support revenues consist of revenues from customer support and maintenance agreements. These
agreements allow customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of software
products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current
year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold
in prior periods. Therefore, changes in customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in
license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months,
and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. The management of the AMC business
reviews customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and use these rates as a method of monitoring customer
service performance. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the customer support renewal rate for the AMC business
was approximately 91.8%, compared to approximately 90.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. For OT
Connectivity, customer support renewal rate was 95.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the 94.5%
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as
contract labor and third-party consulting costs.

Customer support revenues increased by $33.7 million or 11.2% during the year ended December 31, 2023 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an incremental $26.6 million
of customer support revenues from the addition of OT Connectivity over the comparative period. The remaining $7.1
million increase is caused by maintenance related to new license wins in the period and the impacts of moving from
perpetual to term-based licenses within the AMC business. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an


-----

increase in Americas of $18.3 million, an increase in EMEA of $12.7 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $2.7
million.

Cost of customer support revenues increased by $13.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2022, which is comprised of an increase in the AMC business’s direct costs of $8.3
million, allocated shared corporate costs of $3.8 million, and additional direct costs of $1.1 million as a result of the
addition of OT Connectivity. These increases in direct costs and allocations were due to the following:

  - $11.1 million was primarily caused by labor-related and consulting costs increases as a result of a
reorganization of the go-to-market operations of Micro Focus during the second half of 2022. This caused an
increase in the dedicated AMC business customer support headcount and an increase in outsourcing costs
following a transition from internal to outsourced support for first line customer support implemented in the
second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022.

  - In addition, the overall cost pool in 2023 increased due to an increase in corporate labor related costs, which
stemmed from the MF Acquisition.

Overall, the gross margin percentage on Customer support revenues decreased to 90.8% from 94.2%.

**_License_**

License revenues can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses and term licenses. License revenues are impacted
by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, and the competitive strength of the AMC business’s
software products. Cost of license revenues consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties.

License revenues increased by $19.2 million or 14.4% during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an incremental license revenues from the
addition of OT Connectivity of $11.3 million over the comparative period with the remaining $7.9 million increase
caused by strong performance within the Host Connectivity and MF Enterprise Suite portfolios of the AMC business.
The increase in Host Connectivity was a result of new license wins and reversed a decline in 2022 which had returned
license revenue to the historic level of 2021. The increase in MF Enterprise Suite was a consequence of investments
made in sales and engineering resources during 2022 becoming fully effective during 2023. Geographically, the
overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $14.3 million, an increase in EMEA of $4.1 million and
an increase in Asia Pacific of $0.8 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the AMC business had 48 license contracts greater than $0.5 million, of
which 21 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $67.2 million of license revenues. This was compared
to 43 license contracts greater than $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, of which 22 contracts were
greater than $1.0 million, contributing $59.3 million of license revenues.

**_Professional Service_**

Professional service revenues consist primarily of revenues from technical services and training services. Technical
services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Professional services are
typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service revenues can vary from period
to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by the AMC business’s
partner network.

Cost of professional service revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and
training with respect to the AMC business’s various software products. The most significant components of these
costs are personnel-related expenses and third-party subcontracting.

Professional service revenues increased by $6.4 million or 49.1% during the year ended December 31, 2023 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the MF Enterprise
Suite within the AMC business over the comparative period. This increase was the result of additional investments in
consulting resources, which were made during 2022 but became fully effective and revenue generating in 2023.
Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $2.6 million, an increase in EMEA
of $3.7 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $0.1 million.

Cost of professional service revenues increased by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs of $4.3 million
caused by an increase in the number consultants employed by the AMC business during 2022 resulting from a planned
investment in the AMC business’s consulting resources as well as a change to bonus based incentives, which are
included in labor-related costs, rather than commission-based incentives during the second half of 2023. This led to
an offsetting decrease of commissions costs of $1.3 million over the comparative period, along with an immaterial
increase to consulting costs. Overall, the gross margin percentage on professional service revenues increased to 22.7%
from 8.9% as a result of the investment in the recruitment, onboarding and training of consulting resources during
2022, which were then fully utilized in revenue generating activity in 2023.

the AMC business’s exposure to interest rate risks.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

**_Foreign currency transaction risk_**

The AMC business transacts in various foreign currencies. Foreign currency exposures typically arise from
transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term and are transacted in non-functional currency.
Management expects that the AMC business will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to the AMC business’s
foreign currency exposures. The ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally
depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that the AMC business enters into, the currency exchange
rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates.

The AMC business has not entered into derivatives or hedging transactions as exposure to foreign currency exchange
rates has not been material to the audited combined carveout financial statements.


-----

**_Foreign currency translation risk_**

The AMC business’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of
total assets and liabilities that the AMC business reports for foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts
into U.S. dollars.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Our Company**

Rocket is a leading global enterprise software provider with a broad portfolio of products that help corporations,
government agencies, and other organizations run their mission-critical IT operations. We enable small and large
enterprises in many industries to maximize their data, systems and infrastructure to deliver critical services that power
our modern world. Our software runs, optimizes and protects our customers’ applications, servers and databases, and
integrates these core platforms with the rest of the enterprise, while providing a full-stack of modernization solutions.
Our products enable customers to carry out their most mission-critical business functions, such as processing payment
transactions at global financial institutions and maintaining healthcare records at hospitals and insurance companies.

Since our founding over 30 years ago, we have cultivated a customer-centric culture with strategic investments in
R&D that provide a wide range of solutions to meet customers’ evolving needs. We have evolved from solely
maintaining legacy infrastructure to facilitating modernization journeys to connect mainframe to the hybrid cloud
environment. We have accomplished this evolution through substantial R&D efforts, highlighted by over $500 million
in investments into R&D since 2020, as well as multiple acquisitions that have expanded our modernization offering.

Given our focus on supporting our customers’ mission-critical business functions, our products address deeply
embedded technologies that sit at the core of enterprise IT infrastructure. These systems have evolved over multiple
decades and, particularly for our largest customers, represent billions of dollars of cumulative custom application
development and IT infrastructure investment. As enterprises look to the future, hybrid remains vital to enabling the
deployment of cloud environments as it incorporates client server computing, cloud-based platforms, and modern
connectivity and portability.

We seek to enable our customers to experience the best of both the cloud and the mainframe, putting relevant
workloads in the cloud while leveraging the mainframe for its best features – security, reliability, and governance.
Our strategy is to modernize without disruption, meeting customers where they are in their modernization journey. By
utilizing our product portfolio, customers can modernize effectively, even incrementally, integrating new technologies
while preserving and leveraging the robust foundation already in place for a seamless technological evolution. We
believe this approach dramatically lowers risk and improves success rates of IT system modernization projects.

As the pace of digital transformation continues to accelerate, we believe our customers will increasingly look to us to
extract greater value from existing IT systems and applications through innovation, integration, optimization and
modernization.

Today, Rocket is organized into three main business units focused on Infrastructure Modernization, Data
Modernization and Application Modernization. While each business unit has its own technical requirements and
products, we go to market using a holistic approach to solving our customers’ problems, utilizing solutions across our
business units to help drive operating efficiencies among overlapping buying centers to best position us to drive future
growth. These business units are as follows:

_Infrastructure Modernization: Our Infrastructure Modernization business unit represents approximately_
55% of our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It comprises software solutions built
for integrating and optimizing mainframe workloads, mitigating security and compliance risks and
optimizing storage. Organizations can leverage our range of solutions to support mainframe security and
compliance in the face of new threats and deliver optimized mainframe performance management and
interoperability. The mainframe continues to be an integral part of modern-day IT infrastructure and
provides a reliable architecture for high-volume data processing and transactions. Mainframes provide a
level of five 9s of availability (99.999%), which is several orders of magnitude higher than alternative
distributed servers, making mainframes the optimal platform for mission-critical processes. Additionally,
mainframes are uniquely engineered to process millions of input and output calculations per second, which
is a key difference from distributed servers that are designed to be more general purpose, limiting their
ability to perform a specialized task extremely well. Consequently, mainframes provide a range of
advantages over distributed systems that are likely to persist, and we believe organizations in regulated and


-----

data intensive industries will continue to rely on mainframe systems to process high-volume, missioncritical activity at the core of their IT infrastructures.

_Data Modernization: Our Data Modernization business unit represents approximately 18% of our_
standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It provides software solutions to connect
mission-critical data residing on the mainframe and distributed systems to advanced applications and
compute workloads running on private and public cloud environments. As organizations increasingly adopt
a hybrid cloud infrastructure approach to operations, effectively navigating the complexities of data
governance and compliance while maximizing data utilization is critical. Our solutions address this
challenge by eliminating data siloes to enhance decision-making and customer experience while maintaining
strong data governance, security, scalability and dynamic availability. For example, one of our key products,
Mobius, enables customers to integrate seamlessly with third-party repositories, facilitating secure and
efficient data movement between modern and legacy systems. Our track record of successfully integrating
acquisitions within this business unit highlights our commitment to providing an end-to-end offering that
reframes customer engagement strategies and paves the way for future growth.

_Application Modernization: Our Application Modernization business unit represents the remaining 27% of_
our standalone revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. It is comprised of a portfolio of solutions
aimed at improving application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating
modern workflows for legacy applications. While Application Modernization covers both distributed offmainframe platforms and mainframe environments, many of the most important back-end applications for
large enterprises still reside on the mainframe and have yet to be modernized. With key offerings including
database management, DevOps, and low-code application development platforms, we enable organizations
to efficiently deliver reliable, scalable and secure applications to support their core business needs. One of
our key innovations has been to enable enterprise adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid
cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern development practices even for legacy systems.

Across these three business units, we serve over 12,500 end-user customers, pro forma for the AMC Acquisition. Our
customer base spans every major industry vertical and includes some of the largest companies in the world, including
43 of the Fortune 50, as of 2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition). Our customer base is highly
diversified with the top ten Rocket-led customers representing just 14% of revenue in the year ended December 31,
2023 (excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition).

In addition to these deeply embedded and long-term customer relationships, we have also cultivated a number of
partnerships that are critical to our business. Our largest partnership is with IBM. We generate approximately 23% of
our revenue through IBM-led sales. Through a series of organic R&D investments, acquisitions, joint development
efforts and a strong GTM partnership, we have become one of IBM’s most trusted software partners. This partnership
has evolved over 30 years and is driven primarily by our expertise in mainframe and mid-range servers of which IBM
is a major manufacturer. Our software enhances and creates efficiencies for IBM’s customers and extends the life of
IBM’s core platforms. In partnership with IBM, we develop and support core software offerings in their portfolio,
freeing IBM to redirect their R&D spend to other areas. As part of our partnership with IBM, numerous Rocket
products are re-branded as IBM products and sold through their global salesforce.

While we are committed to remaining a high-quality business partner to IBM and extending the lifetime value of core
IBM-led products, we are working to increase the share of Rocket-led sales to further diversify our revenue. Our
Rocket-led GTM strategy, whether executed directly or through our channel partners, allows us to provide best-inclass support to our customers in managing their mainframe and modernization journey, particularly as they move
towards a hybrid cloud environment.

We are headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and maintain a large global footprint with significant operations in
North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia. As of December 31, 2023 we had 2,200 employees
(excluding the impact of the AMC Acquisition) worldwide with a presence in 13 global offices. Following the AMC
Acquisition, we expect to have approximately 3,000 Rocketeers and 20 global offices. This worldwide coverage
provides us with access to economies of scale, lower cost offshore operations, high-growth emerging markets and
global support for our increasingly global customer base.

**Acquisition of Application Modernization and Connectivity**

On November 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the AMC business of OpenText, which
includes historically a product group of Micro Focus and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OT Connectivity business,
a product group of OpenText, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments.
For more information, see “Summary––The AMC Acquisition.”

The AMC business has been a leader in application modernization for many years with a focus on mainframe
replatforming solutions that help with the migration and operation of mainframe workloads to distributed and cloud
environments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the AMC business generated Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue
of $504 million and Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA of $307 million. AMC Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue is
comprised of (x) for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately $355 million of ARR, $108 million of
perpetual license revenue and $13 million of professional service revenue, and (y) for the year ended December 31,
2023, approximately $364 million of ARR, $121 million of perpetual license revenue and $20 million of professional
services revenue. The AMC business operates within five portfolio segments that form a comprehensive suite for
mainframe application development, maintenance and modernization:

_Enterprise Suite: The AMC business’s Enterprise Suite business unit represents approximately 18% of its_
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution is the AMC business’s fastest growing product
line, providing end-to-end mainframe workload migration tools including migration analysis, test and
deployment tools and an enterprise server that emulates the mainframe environment in the cloud. The
Enterprise Suite helps organizations move mainframe workloads to run on distributed environments with a
significantly lower degree of code change relative to other complex migration options like refactoring.
Within the Enterprise Suite, four core tools address different stages of workload migration and application
development. The Analyzer, Developer and Enterprise Test Server are focused on delivering diagnostic
tools, modern IDE and virtual test environments. The Enterprise Server provides a multi-platform
production environment to replatform IBM z/OS applications. The revenue derived from Enterprise Server
is highly recurring in nature and allows for an emulated mainframe on cloud environments with the ability
to run mission-critical applications.

_COBOL: The AMC business’s COBOL business unit represents approximately 36% of its revenue for the_
year ended December 31, 2023. This solution enables organizations to develop, maintain and deploy
COBOL based applications across the enterprise using modern DevOps tools and platforms. COBOL is a
legacy programming language that is integral to the majority of mission-critical applications. As most
developers lack experience working in COBOL, a modern set of DevOps tools enables enterprises to
modernize and update their most important applications. The AMC business’s tools provide an IDE for
analyzing and editing COBOL in applications primarily off-mainframe, providing developers with
visualizations and coding environments similar to modern IDEs. As one indicator of the AMC business’s
market position, the AMC business is the only official COBOL compiler available on CSPs marketplaces.

_Host Connectivity: The AMC business’s Host Connectivity business unit represents approximately 32% of_
its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This solution includes mainframe terminal emulators and
plugins for application access, process automation and security solutions. Customer use cases include
providing flexible access to mission-critical applications running on mainframe environments via modern,
distributed systems (desktop, web and mobile) in a secure and compliant manner (i.e. multi factor
authentication). The AMC business’s Host Connectivity tools provide a broad number of options that allow
for significant customization to deliver strong, auditable and compliant security that meets organizations’
requirements.

_Mainframe Application Development Life Cycle Management: The AMC business’s Mainframe ADLM_
business unit represents approximately 11% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This
solution provides mainframe source code change, configuration and management enabling organizations to
modernize and integrate mainframes across new technologies and platforms. This results in shorter app
delivery cycles, stronger security and increased productivity. Customer use cases include version control
functionality to track changes made to source code (i.e. ChangeMan ZMF), change management workflow,
release management and automation, automated testing, auditing and reporting.


-----

_CORBA: The AMC business’s COBRA business unit represents approximately 3% of its revenue for the_
year ended December 31, 2023. This solution provides middleware for communication across distributed
applications. CORBA add-on solutions enable any CORBA application to take advantage of new
deployment models, including cloud, containers and virtual environments or to extend and re-use existing
CORBA resources without prior knowledge of CORBA technology. These solutions are used in
telecommunications for managing network elements and the integration of different vendor equipment, in
military and defense for building command and control systems and in finance for trading and risk
management systems.

The AMC Acquisition represents a highly complementary addition to our product portfolio, with the AMC business
expected to further build out a more diverse modernization portfolio that aligns with customer demands and allows us
to meet our customers wherever they are on their modernization journey. The AMC Acquisition is expected to achieve
key strategic objectives, including:

  - Expanding the product portfolio with a stronger, more comprehensive modernization offering that is able to
meet customers at any stage of their IT modernization journey, whether modernizing in place, migrating
select workloads to hybrid environments or replatforming;

  - Providing a full-stack of products and solutions to enable end-to-end modernization without the disruption
of existing workflows and allow customers to derive value from their decades of investment in core
applications;

  - Expanding customer reach through deeper and broader customer engagement across Fortune 2000 accounts
for greater retention and cross-selling. A more comprehensive and complete offering solidifies Rocket as the
strategic partner of choice to address customer needs, tapping into developer-led decisions and guiding
customers through their modernization journey over time, ultimately expanding Rocket’s relevance;

  - Tapping into CSP budget pools through the AMC business’s replatforming capabilities, augmenting our
existing hybrid cloud solutions suite and expanding our footprint with CSPs including Google Cloud
Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure as preferred replatforming partners;

  - Expanding our global reach, with a stronger presence in EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin American channels,
thus diversifying our revenue sources and redistributing geographic concentrations; and

  - Combining R&D engines to drive increased innovation, better modernization capabilities and more elegant
solutions to further accelerate a shifty to hybrid cloud technology. The AMC business’s additional resources
for innovation will foster continuous R&D innovation through the application of emerging technologies like
generative artificial intelligence.

Acquiring the AMC business’s replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs, including Google Cloud
Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure, is expected to enable us to tap into new budget pools and
augment our existing hybrid cloud solutions suite. Rocket has broken down the boundaries of on-premises and cloud
computing so that businesses can connect IT systems and modern applications. The seamless data flow, data
integration and continuous enhancements create benefits like streamlined processes, improved efficiencies, and better
return on investment so that customers can be more dynamic, secure, and agile in the face of an increasingly complex
IT and business environment. Access to the AMC business’s additional software developers will drive increased
innovation and development of better solutions to accelerate a shift to a hybrid cloud environment, reinforcing our
commitment to our customer-centric R&D efforts. This move is expected to further strengthen our position as the
partner of choice for mission-critical IT modernization.

**Our GTM Strategy**

Our marketing and GTM strategies are driven, first and foremost, to deliver the right solutions to customers, regardless
of channel. To that end, our sales and marketing efforts are bifurcated between our Rocket-led products and our IBMled products, each of which have their own strategies.


-----

Our Rocket-led products are sold through two primary avenues: (1) direct to customer through our centralized
customer success, support and delivery teams and (2) channel partners.

  - Our direct sales force and marketing investment, which is focused on Rocket-led solutions, is shifting the
dialogue from mainframe buying centers to a CIO and CPO strategy covering the expanse of Rocket use
cases. We rely on marketing to drive brand awareness, generate leads across our growth product areas and
support subscription and maintenance renewals by reinforcing the value delivered by our new releases and
product innovation. Through our 30-year operating history and over 50 acquisitions, we have a strong base
of customers that we continually look to serve with our growing portfolio of solutions. Our sales force targets
both existing customers and new logo opportunities and is comprised of a global set of enterprise sales
professionals focused on account relationships. Our enterprise sales professionals are product specialists who
focus on selling our solutions with our solutions engineers providing technical guidance to customers
throughout the sales process. This team handles new sales as well as up-sells and cross-sells within existing
accounts, further driving revenue expansion. Renewals of existing maintenance contracts and subscriptions
are handled by our centralized renewal team, who have helped to drive our consistently high renewal rates.

  - In addition to our direct sales force, our Rocket-led sales organization also leads our strategic alliances. Our
10 strategic channel partner relationships consist of resellers, distributors and systems integrators who embed
our solutions in other software applications and help to deliver new solutions to market. Our strong
relationships with Independent ISVs and MSPs enable us to better reach both current and potential customers,
and these strong MSP relationships also support customers using MSPs to manage their mainframe.

For our IBM-led products, we have a dedicated sales enablement team across the IBM OEM product segments, all
backed by a 30-year longstanding partnership driving us and IBM to partner on opportunities and deployments. These
joint Rocket-IBM sales and marketing initiatives allow us to drive demand, refine messaging, enable sales and
strengthen win rates for our IBM-led products, which continue to have strong retention rates supported by the strength
of our partnership with IBM. In addition to benefits that we realize from the partnership, IBM also leverages us to
support the broader mainframe industry and expand value delivered from incumbent involvement.

Ultimately, our powerful GTM strategy is bolstered by a centralized customer success and support effort with global
coverage, a dedicated team focused on renewals and driving upsell and cross-sell opportunities across the installed
base, numerous strategic alliances that help market and distribute our solutions and a robust partnership with IBM.
The combination of these factors forms our strong customer success engine and continues to help us drive strong
retention rates.

We have further built our business to serve the expanding needs of our customers and address growing budget pools
that are focused on digital transformation. We’ve transitioned from a focus on providing solutions to the head of
infrastructure to addressing a head of applications or a Chief Data Officer who is focused on driving revenue
generation of their business. Whether it is the CIO or the Chief Data Officer, we have solutions that address their
mission-critical challenges and our GTM approach ensures that we serve the different needs of our expanded buyer
set. The combined forces of Rocket and the AMC business are expected to create a broader product offering that
serves the entire modernization continuum, all in a single partner.

As one example of how the AMC Acquisition will help broaden our product offering and modernization capabilities,
we expect the AMC business to provide us with additional GTM channels to tap into CSP budget pools given the
AMC business’s strength in replatforming capabilities and strong relationships with CSPs. We believe this will further
elevate Rocket’s status with MSPs, CSPs and other key ecosystem participants, further strengthening and
differentiating our GTM strategy.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

_Deep and Embedded Portfolio of Solutions Meets Customer Needs Across Environments_


-----

Since our founding, we have focused strategically on innovation to develop and enhance our software solutions to
consistently meet our customers’ evolving needs. Our portfolio of solutions represents a full-stack of purpose-built
products tailored to various end markets. Within each of these environments, we address customer pain points at every
layer of their IT system. This ranges from the core IT infrastructure (i.e. software tooling for the mainframe itself or
an embedded database) to newly developed applications that are open source in nature and run in the cloud but need
to integrate with the more traditional components of a customer’s IT system. In delivering this comprehensive portfolio
of products, we focus on opportunities categorized within our three synergistic business lines: Infrastructure
Modernization, Data Modernization and Application Modernization. We expect the AMC Acquisition to bring a suite
of tools with a focus on mainframe modernization and replatforming that help with the migration of critical mainframe
workloads to distributed and cloud environments. The AMC Acquisition is expected to broaden our existing product
portfolio with complementary modernization solutions and an increased focus on enabling migration to the cloud.

Illustrative use cases that enable customers throughout their modernization journey include but are not limited to:

  - Creating modern platforms and tools that are faster, cheaper and lower risk than replacing incumbent systems
to modernize;

  - Providing a toolset for mainframe replatforming and management of critical mainframe migration workloads;

  - Providing the tools for modern, compliant, and agile developer experiences;

  - Managing and operating core IT infrastructure more efficiently without forcing disruptive re-platforming;

  - Connecting legacy systems with cloud infrastructure; and

  - Managing accelerating data growth and provide real-time access for AI, ML, data and analytics.

By focusing on providing a full-stack solution to these deeply embedded technologies and environments, we believe
we have established ourselves as a highly valued and differentiated provider to our customers and partners.
_Long-Term, Blue-Chip Customers Rely on Rocket to Modernize Mission-Critical Applications_

Over our 30-year history we have created and developed deeply embedded relationships with a wide array of
customers ranging from small and mid-market businesses to governments and the largest enterprises in the world.
Following the AMC Acquisition, we expect to serve over 12,500 end-user customers across a broad range of industries
with particular strength in financial services, aerospace and defense, automotive manufacturing, retail, government
and healthcare. Our customer base also includes governments, major telecommunications companies, educational
institutions, retailers and other institutions, as well as channel partners including IT outsourcing providers, distributors
and systems integrators. Our strong presence in numerous industry verticals helps to diversify our revenue base, and
the mission-critical nature of our products mitigates the risk of industry-specific and cyclical downturns. Our
customers include 86% of the Fortune 50, as of 2023. 28 of the top 30 Fortune 50 companies trust and use Rocket, as
well as all top 10 commercial banks.


-----

We expect the AMC Acquisition to bring approximately 5,000 global blue chip customer accounts with significant
overlap to Rocket’s existing customer base, diversifying our revenue sources and geographic reach with a stronger
presence in EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin American channels while retaining a core revenue base in North America.

_Customer-Centric R&D Drives Value Proposition and Customer Stickiness_

With nearly 1,900 Rocketeer Engineers (pro forma for the AMC Acquisition) and an R&D presence in five continents,
we are committed to developing and maintaining a strong R&D organization. This commitment has enabled us to
continuously adapt to and meet our customers’ evolving needs by enhancing our existing products and developing
new ones. Our customer-first approach to development has driven a customer satisfaction score of 94% for 2023.

We created our business units to help organize R&D by underlying system type and technology themes to better align
with our customers’ needs and increase accountability and ownership of results. As a result, we develop a granular
view on key R&D investment strategies that minimize cost overruns or delays and have a targeted R&D strategy to


-----

better serve key customers and channel partners. As a global research organization, we also have access to a wide and
deep pool of talent across both high-cost and low-cost centers to drive efficiencies.

The strength of our R&D efforts has translated into competitive wins in the market. For example, the largest Italian
postal group, a long-term Rocket Mobius customer, upgraded its existing content management system (Mobius) that
enabled the use of Mobius with their Amazon Web Services platform, benefitting from Rocket’s investments in hybrid
cloud enablement and API integrations. Our efforts in improving UI and UX in application modernization products
provided a leading global provider of financial market infrastructure services with a better sign-in experience for
clients which was previously a key pain point. Our customer-centric R&D approach enhances our value proposition
and drives customer stickiness.

The acquisition reinforces and magnifies Rocket’s commitment to innovation and R&D, incorporating cloud, AI and
ML alongside the company’s decades-long development and track record in mission-critical systems.

development costs as a percentage of Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue after giving pro forma effect to the AMC
Acquisition. For a definition and more information about these metrics, see “Summary––Summary Historical and
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information.”

_Diversified, End-to-End Modernization Platform Supporting Full-Stack Modernization_

Our Infrastructure Modernization, Application Modernization and Data Modernization business units form one suite
of solutions that enables customers to modernize end-to-end across their IT systems and support a transition to a hybrid
cloud environment. This shift in focus towards a full-stack of modernization solutions has provided us access to
multiple growing budget pools. In 2018, 44% of our GTM motion was Rocket-led with the remainder being IBM-led.
As of 2023 (pro forma for the AMC Acquisition), approximately 77% of our GTM motion is Rocket-led representing
our evolved strategy whereby the significant majority of our GTM motion is Rocket-led.

With an emphasized focus on supporting full-stack modernization, we have been able to tap into multiple budget pools
expanding beyond legacy infrastructure spend and into evergreen budgets focused on digital transformation. These
budget pools are controlled by several buying centers across an organization including the Chief Information Officer,
Chief Data Officer, Head of Applications, Chief Information Security Officer and Head of Infrastructure, all of whom
are focused on full-stack modernization. With the addition of the AMC business, we’re also increasing our exposure
with developers, who are often key decision makers within DevOps budget pools for application modernization.


-----

With the AMC business’s capabilities, we expect to deliver full-stack modernization solutions that vastly expand the
value our customers get out of their systems and their core data thereby augmenting our customers’ ability to deliver
hybrid solutions that enable new customer experiences.

_Predictable, High Visibility Revenue Model_

We derive the majority of our revenues from subscriptions and maintenance, which, in conjunction with our strong
historical renewal and retention rates, have provided a steady and visible revenue stream. For the year ended December
31, 2023, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 76% of our total revenues. Our software solutions are
mission-critical and deeply embedded within the IT infrastructure, which results in high switching costs given the
disruptive, time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of new enterprise software installations. Many of our
products have been embedded in customers’ IT infrastructures for over a decade, making our products expensive and
risky to replace. Furthermore, our significant domain expertise enables a high level of end-user customization, further
entrenching our solutions within our customers’ business processes. Our historical gross and net revenue retention
have averaged 93% and 102%, respectively since 2022.

(4) Net Retention Rate is calculated with the same numerator as gross retention and adds upsells, cross-sells and price
increases, which is then divided by the ARR that was up for renewal in that same period.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the AMC business had $504 million of Non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue, $307
million of Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA and a strong loss-only gross retention rate of 96%. We are comfortable
with the accretive nature of this business and expect the AMC business to strengthen our client retention, broaden our
cross-sell opportunities and drive sustainable growth in markets we know very well.


-----

_Strong Free Cash Flow Generation_

Our high Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA margins and limited capital expenditure requirements drive significant
Free Cash Flow generation. The AMC Acquisition is expected to strengthen our cash generation profile, lifting the
overall Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA margin to approximately 60% and Free Cash Flow Conversion to
approximately 98%. Going forward, we believe that our stable customer base and revenue visibility will enable us to
continue to generate strong Free Cash Flow.

_Experienced Management Team_

Our business is run by Milan Shetti, who joined us in 2020 and now serves as CEO and President. He brings valuable
experience from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where he worked for over 10 years. Since 2019, we have made
significant investments in bringing in and hiring valuable executives to lead our next phase of growth. Our leadership
contributes a wide array of experiences at multiple industry-leading technology and software companies, providing
valuable insights and skills that help to run our business. Over the last four years, we have enhanced our management
team through the recruitment of not only new Chief Executive, Financial, Marketing, Revenue, Information, People
and Legal Officers, but also two new Business Unit Presidents. These strategic new hires bring with them strong
connections with IBM and other key channel partners. We maintain a partnership framework with IBM executives
that facilitates alignment with functions within IBM and Rocket and, across the organization, our executives and
business unit leaders maintain regular dialogue with their IBM counterparts.

Following the AMC Acquisition, we expect to hire Stuart McGill, the current Chief Revenue Officer of the AMC
business, who has been with the company since 1984, and Neil Fowler, the current Chief Technology Officer of the


Synergies

AMC business, who has been with the company since 1991. Mr. McGill and Mr. Fowler would bring decades of
experience and expertise to our already talented management team.

We believe that our success in steadily growing Rocket as a cash-flow generative company has greatly benefitted from
these strategic hires, and we anticipate continued success in the future.

**Our Strategy**

_Embrace Hybrid Cloud to Enable Enterprises to Unlock New Capabilities and Growth Opportunities and_
_Simultaneously Optimize Mission-Critical Systems_

Through our strategy of enabling enterprises to embrace and innovate with hybrid cloud, companies can deploy,
execute and manage workloads, applications and data agnostic of their chosen infrastructure in a seamless and
transparent manner from mainframe to cloud. This approach allows enterprises to not only maximize the full potential
and value of their data stored on mainframe, but also leverage that data to drive decisions and insights from cloudnative capabilities, including AI, ML and advanced analytics. One of our key innovations has been to enable enterprise
adoption of unified DevOps across mainframe and hybrid cloud architectures, which enables teams to deploy modern
development practices even for legacy systems and which we expect the AMC Acquisition to further enhance. This
will empower our customers as they pursue their modernization journeys, and we are right there with them. Ultimately,
this narrative aligns the technology investments made by enterprises with their key business outcomes, providing
customers with a complete lifecycle of solutions and letting them focus on business without worrying about the
constraints of their current technology architecture.

_Focus on R&D and Investment in Product Portfolio_

Since 2020, we have invested $521 million in R&D initiatives. With nearly 1,900 Rocketeer Engineers (pro forma for
the AMC Acquisition) and an R&D presence in five continents, our R&D investment is the cornerstone of our ability
to innovate, enabling us to better address customer needs, retain existing accounts and attract new business. It also
allows us to provide full-stack solutions to our customers, which we believe, in conjunction with our powerful GTM
team and strategy, will ultimately drive strong retention rates among our installed bases. Our customer-centric R&D
shows our true understanding of the different needs of our customers and buyers who are looking to modernize their
infrastructure, reinforcing, and magnifying our commitment to innovation. Additionally, because we’ve scaled the
business so significantly through both organic and inorganic growth, we’ve managed to achieve significant scale
efficiency in our R&D investments.

_Support Full-Stack Modernization and Tap into Multiple Budget Pools_

We provide a full-stack of infrastructure, application, and data modernization solutions, allowing companies to
integrate legacy and distributed systems with modern cloud capabilities. This full-stack of IT system modernization
solutions allows us to tap into multiple budget pools, including those covered by the CIO, Chief Data Officer, Head
of Applications, Chief Information Security Officer, Head of Infrastructure and more. With our suite of products and
solutions, we can help companies ensure that their existing infrastructure is able to successfully deliver digital
transformation initiatives and provide competitive advantages; deliver new mission-critical applications across hybrid
infrastructures; govern and access key data and content to strengthen customer relationships and ensure compliance;
and drive key initiatives to secure and protect data across the broader enterprise. This multi-layered approach opens
corporate budgets beyond the mainframe and infrastructure-centric buyer and expands our wallet share to larger digital
transformation initiatives that we can access through upsell and cross-sell opportunities.

_Maintain Our Strong Operational Efficiency and Profitability_

Our focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management has helped us to maintain consistently high
Adjusted EBITDA margins. This commitment to cost control has enabled our ongoing investments in R&D to further
expand our solution footprint. We believe this continued emphasis on cost control results in attractive operating
leverage and cash flow generation.


-----

_Pursue Accretive Acquisitions to Further Supplement Our Portfolio_

Over our history, we have completed more than 50 acquisitions and developed a track record of successfully
integrating acquired companies. Acquisitions have historically been completed at attractive multiples and have
allowed us to further enhance our product portfolio. Our multi-prong approach to evaluating potential acquisitions
includes identification of (1) Solution Enhancement, (2) Solution Expansion and (3) Synergy Realization, which
allows us to be intentional and methodical throughout both the discovery and vetting processes. We focus on
opportunities that accelerate the development of important underinvested functionalities, provide cross-selling
opportunities, and rationalize costs through scale.

**Our Industry**

We view our business as having three distinct addressable markets, each of which is aligned with a specific business
unit. While these markets are distinct in nature, there is a common thread in that the environment and underlying
technology are deeply embedded and responsible for organizations’ most mission-critical functions. We expect the
AMC Acquisition to further build out our product capabilities to address all customer use cases, and we will integrate
the AMC business’s products into our existing business units. While investment in legacy systems has been stable,
companies are increasing their spend across modernization, integration, hybridization and next-generation data
applications. We are positioned to serve as a modernization partner that taps into growing budget pools focused on
digital transformation across a suite of buyers with evergreen budget pools including the CIO, Chief Data Officer,
Head of Applications and Head of Infrastructure. In aggregate, we view our current total addressable market as $24
billion, which sits within a broader $3.9 trillion digital transformation market. Our three current addressable markets
are as follows:

  - _Mainframe and Hybrid Cloud Software: Our infrastructure modernization products support customers in_
optimizing their mainframe workloads across a broad spectrum of pathways. Based on third-party market
research, we estimate the current market related to mainframe and hybrid cloud software to be approximately
$11 billion. Going forward, this market is expected to grow at approximately 4% annually. We believe we
have an approximately 4% market share of this addressable market. For most of our customers, the embedded
nature of mainframe servers and the speed, size and security requirements of the workloads being run on
them make switching away from the mainframe an expensive and difficult process. The importance of
mainframe is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of the world’s production IT workloads are
handled by mainframes. According to IBM, over $8 trillion in payments per year, and over 30 billion
transactions per day, are processed by mainframes. Mainframe criticality is driven by the need for reliability,
with many applications requiring high availability, and the complexity and vastness of the underlying code
makes mainframe integral to operations. There are a range of advantages that mainframe offers over
distributed computing including reliability, speed of computing and security. For customers who remain on
the mainframe, the increased data requirements and volumes generated by the digitalization of businesses
will lead to increasing mainframe workloads. For example, when retail bank account holders check their
account or engage in online banking, this activity results in queries to the mainframe creating additional
mainframe transaction volume. As retail banks and other institutions increase their product offerings and
continue their digital transformation initiatives, the ability to connect and interact with the mainframe will be
an important component of most IT deployments. Higher workload volume combined with the ongoing need
to operate, optimize, and modernize the mainframe should provide continued growth opportunities within
our Infrastructure Modernization business unit.

We expect the AMC Acquisition to expand our product offerings in the mainframe and hybrid cloud market
with Enterprise Suite, COBOL and Mainframe ADLM, enabling further modernization of mainframe
applications and hybrid cloud infrastructure. With the largest companies in the world across every major
industry vertical continuing to leverage mainframe technology through hybrid cloud models, we expect that
hybrid infrastructure will remain the architecture of choice. By enabling core IT infrastructure to continue
living in mainframe environments while leveraging APIs that provide teams and customers with access to
cloud solutions and web and mobile applications, businesses are providing a modern experience for
employees and end-users, without taking on additional risk.

  - _Enterprise Content Management: Data modernization solutions enable organizations to capture, build,_
organize, manage and store enterprise documents and records. Using third-party market research, we estimate
the current market related to ECM solutions to be approximately $5 billion. Going forward, this market is
forecasted to grow at approximately 6% annually. Enterprises need to securely manage documents and
records across their organization and require software that provides tools to capture, build, organize, manage
and store documents and records as they flow through business processes. ECM modernization tools for
mainframe-based enterprises allow organizations to utilize terabytes of stored data that are typically
inaccessible and unutilized. Common applications of ECM systems for our customers involve document
generation workloads, which include invoice and statement generation and ticket issuance. More advanced
processes include document ingestion, robotic process automation and workflow management. For example,
processing a mortgage application is a complex process involving multiple steps and systems, which can be
streamlined and automated with an ECM system. ECM solutions are often embedded in core customer facing
workflows and are integrated with other core IT systems (enterprise resource planning systems, customer
relationship management systems, financial systems, etc.) that leverage other mainframe-stored content. The
critical nature and deep integration of ECM workflows should continue to drive future growth within our
Data Modernization business unit.

  - _App Development & Testing: Our application modernization solutions enable organizations to extract data_
from legacy Unix/Power Systems, modernize the experience for users and enable the usability of large scale
non-relational databases. Based on third-party market research, we estimate the current market related to
application development and testing to be approximately $8 billion. Going forward, this market is forecasted
to grow by approximately 5% annually. Organizations use application modernization products to improve
application responsiveness and engagement across hybrid environments by creating modern workflows for
legacy applications in a safe and secure way. Common uses of application modernization products include
enabling application development on top of mission-critical non-relational databases, removing complexity
from building modern apps on legacy platforms with low- or no-code solutions and supporting agile DevOps
methods across multiple legacy coding environments. Continued investment in functionality that supports
cloud and containerized app deployments, organizations improving application UI/UX and a shift to low- or
no-code development concepts should provide continued growth opportunities within our Application
Modernization business unit. The AMC business’s Host Connectivity and CORBA segments offer
complementary modernization solutions enabling Rocket to provide a more comprehensive solution to our
customers and increase our share in the application and development testing market.

**Our Competition**

The market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected
by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We face direct and indirect
competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to our current and
potential customers.

Competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on:

    - product features, functionality, performance and price;

    - cost containment;

    - ease of integration and speed of implementation;

    - company stability, resources and reputation;

    - level of customer service; and

    - new product and technology introductions.


-----

We believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are our:

    - diversified base of long-standing customers;

    - innovative and effective research and development organization;

    - unique and differentiated partnership with IBM;

    - highly visible and predictable revenue model;

    - strong Free Cash Flow generation; and

    - experienced, founder-led management team.

Our most frequently encountered competitors are BMC Software, Fortra and Broadcom.

It is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants or alternative technologies. Moreover,
as the market for application infrastructure and tools, database tools suite, data management and analytics and storage
and security develops, a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to enter
or increase their presence in our industry, either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our
competitors, or otherwise increase their focus on the industry. In addition, current and potential competitors have
established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability
of their products to address the needs of our current and potential customers.

**Research and Development**

We believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to maintain and improve our core technologies,
enhance our existing products, and develop new products that meet an expanding range of customer requirements.

We have a differentiated research and development philosophy resulting in world-class revenue retention rates while
leveraging a highly cost-efficient global platform. We have a team of 2,276 “Rocketeers,” of which approximately
63% are engineers. We go to market through dedicated enterprise sales, inside sales and renewals teams as well as
channel partners.

Our research and development model is based on the following key principles:

    - **_Customer-centric approach: customer pain points identified by sales and customer success teams drive_**
product investments that will meet customers’ greatest needs.

    - **_Agile organization: proactively address new technology/customer trends, leveraging existing source_**
code, moving from closed to open architectures and frameworks.

    - **_Strong partnership with IBM: deep insights into IBM’s mainframe roadmap and collaborative_**
development opportunities ensure Rocket’s continued technical leadership.

    - **_Commitment and priority: approximately 63% of Rocketeers are software engineers who work in a_**
highly collaborative culture which values teamwork, creativity and innovation.

**Intellectual Property**

Our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property
rights primarily through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, and other measures. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our
personnel, new product development, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product


-----

maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position. There can be no
assurance that our means of protecting our intellectual property in the U.S. or abroad will be adequate. We seek to
protect the source code of our proprietary software, any related documentation, and other written materials under trade
secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. Further, there can be no assurance that our patents
will offer any protection or that they will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. If we are unable to protect
our intellectual property, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party, our operating results could
be adversely affected.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the instruments evidencing our material indebtedness. This
summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the
provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not otherwise defined in this
offering memorandum.

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

On November 28, 2018, the Company entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that was amended by
that certain (i) Amendment No. 1, dated as of February 2, 2021, (ii) Amendment No. 2 and Joinder Agreement, dated
as of May 20, 2021, (iii) Amendment No. 3, dated as of June 28, 2021, (iv) Amendment No. 4, dated as of August 6,
2021, (v) Amendment No. 5 and Second Joinder Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2022, (vi) Amendment No. 6,
dated as of December 22, 2022, (vii) Amendment No. 7, dated as of June 1, 2023, and (viii) Amendment No. 8, dated
as of October 5, 2023. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are comprised of the Existing First Lien Term Loans,
which includes a first lien term loan consisting of the Existing Dollar Term Loan, an aggregate principal amount of
approximately $1,410 million in U.S. dollar-denominated term loans, and the Existing Euro Term Loan, an aggregate
principal amount of €575 million in Euro-denominated term loans (after giving effect to amortization payments made
prior to the date hereof), each maturing on November 28, 2028, and the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility,
a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to approximately $152.9 million maturing on
November 28, 2026. On or around the date of issuance of the notes offered hereby, we intend to amend certain terms
of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to, among other things, (v) increase the aggregate principal amount of
commitments under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility by approximately $222 million to approximately
$375 million, (w) extend the maturity date of certain of the revolving commitments under the Existing First Lien
Revolving Credit Facility from November 28, 2026 to August 29, 2028, (x) increase the applicable margin for adjusted
SOFR to 4.00%, (y) increase the first lien net leverage ratio financial covenant to an amount not to exceed 8.00 to
1.00 and (z) add requirements for certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales to
guarantee and secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

On or around the date of issuance of the notes offered hereby, we intend to enter into the Euro Incremental Term Loan
Facility under the credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans and the USD Incremental Term
Loan Facility, either as a side car term loan facility or as an incremental term loan facility under the credit agreement
governing the Existing First Lien Term Loans, in a combined aggregate principal amount of $1,000 million (reflecting
U.S. dollar-equivalent for the Euro Incremental Term Loan Facility), in each case with a syndicate of lenders, that
will rank pari passu with the Existing First Lien Term Loans and which will mature on November 28, 2028.

The documentation for our Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides that we have the right at any time, subject to
customary conditions, to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (1)
$175 million and (2) an amount equal to 65% of our trailing twelve-month consolidated EBITDA at the time of
determination on a pro forma basis, plus (b) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments (including open market
purchases) of the Existing First Lien Term Loans and certain other debt (to the extent not funded with the proceeds of
long-term debt other than revolving loans), plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments of any first lien
refinancing facilities or certain other refinancing debt, plus (d) an additional amount so long as we (I) in the case of
incremental debt that is secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, do
not exceed a specified pro forma first lien net leverage ratio, (II) in the case of incremental debt that is secured by a
lien on the collateral junior to the liens securing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro
forma secured net leverage ratio and (III) in the case of unsecured incremental debt or incremental debt secured solely
by assets not constituting collateral, do not exceed a specified pro forma total net leverage ratio.

The interest rate for the Existing Dollar Term Loan is or will be, as applicable, at the Company’s election: (i) 3.75%,
plus “ABR” defined as the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (b) the prime lending rate in
effect on such day, and (c) Term SOFR applicable for an interest period of one month commencing on such day plus
1.0%; or (ii) 4.75% plus Term SOFR, which is subject to a 0.50% Term SOFR floor and Term SOFR adjustment. The
interest rate for the Existing Euro Term Loan is: (i) 4.75%, plus “Adjusted EURIBOR Rate,” which is subject to a
0.00% floor. Interest payments are due either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for Term
SOFR Loans and Adjusted EURIBOR Rate Loans, no less frequently than quarterly. Principal payments of 1% per


-----

annum of the initial Existing First Lien Term Loans amounts are payable quarterly, with the remaining balance due at
the maturity date for the Existing First Lien Term Loans on November 28, 2028. The interest rate for the Incremental
First Lien Term Loan Facilities is expected to be Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin.

The Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility interest rate is, at the Company’s election, (i) 2.25% plus ABR, or
(ii) 3.25% plus SOFR with margin step-downs dependent on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio as follows:
(a) if the first lien net leverage ratio is between 4.50 to 1.00 and 4.00 to 1.00 the ABR and SOFR margins are 2.125%
and 3.125%, respectively; and (b) if the first lien net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 the ABR and
SOFR margins are 2.00% and 3.00%, respectively. The maturity date of the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit
Facility is November 28, 2026.

The Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility’s capacity is reduced by the aggregated letters of credit outstanding,
which totaled $1.2 million as of December 31, 2023.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant that applies solely with respect to the Existing First
Lien Revolving Credit Facility and requires a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 7.70 to 1.00 if, on the last day
of any quarter, the principal amount of revolving credit loans then outstanding under the Existing First Lien Revolving
Credit Facility is greater than 35% of the aggregate outstanding revolving credit commitments.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are also subject to certain mandatory prepayment requirements, including, with
respect to the Existing First Lien Term Loans, 50% (with step-downs to 25% and 0% based on achieving certain first
lien net leverage ratios) of annual excess cash flow greater than $15 million in any fiscal year. The Senior Secured
Credit Facilities also contain quarterly and annual financial reporting requirements.

For further information, see _Note 10, Long-Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included_
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**RSD Debt**

As of August 16, 2019, we assumed the RSD Debt in connection with the acquisition of Sixon Holding SA. Pursuant
to the credit agreement governing the RSD Debt, dated September 19, 2018, the RSD Debt consists of a CHF 17.5
million senior amortizing term loan facility and a CHF 17.5 million senior non-amortizing (bullet) term loan facility.
The amortizing term loan facility is subject to mandatory repayments of CHF 3.2 million, payable annually on
December 31st through 2022, with a final payment of CHF 3.2 million due on March 28, 2024 (which payment was
made). The non-amortizing term loan facility, which consists of U.S. dollar-denominated facilities and Eurodenominated facilities, has a maturity date of September 28, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding amount,
translated into U.S. dollars, under the RSD Debt was $19.7 million.

For further information, see _Note 10,_ _Long-Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included_
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**6.500% Senior Notes due 2029**

On February 2, 2021, we issued $575 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2029, to
persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act)
and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The Existing Notes are jointly and severally unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under certain credit facilities.

The Existing Notes will mature on February 15, 2029. Interest on the Existing Notes accrues at a rate of 6.500% per
annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. On or after February 15,
2024, we may redeem, in whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption
prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on

2025.................................................................................................................................................. 101.625%
2026 and thereafter............................................................................................................................ 100.000%

The indenture governing the Existing Notes limits the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, subject to
certain exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness; declare or pay dividends, redeem stock
or make other distributions to stockholders; make investments; create liens or use assets as security in other
transactions; merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; enter into
transactions with affiliates; and sell or transfer certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important
exceptions and qualifications. In addition, in certain circumstances, if the Issuer sells assets or experience certain
changes of control, they must offer to purchase the Existing Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any.

other related terms are only applicable in the event the USD Incremental Term Loan Facility (as defined in this offering
memorandum) takes the form of a side car agreement.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date (as defined
below), among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as
trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”).

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, the gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be
deposited into the Escrow Account (as defined below) pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (as defined
below). In the event that the Completion Date (as defined below) has not occurred on or before the Escrow Outside
Date (as defined below) or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the
release of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), is more fully described below under “—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.” The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to
the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement.
Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the proposed forms of the Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find More Information And Incorporation By
Reference.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.” The
capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of Notes” as so defined.

The Company does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be required to, nor
does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or
otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of
the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, the Notes will be secured only by a first-priority security interest
in the Escrow Account and all funds on deposit therein (as set forth under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption”).

From and after the Completion Date, the Notes will be:

    - general senior secured obligations of the Company, secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral,
subject to certain Liens (as defined below) permitted under the Indenture;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness (including Indebtedness_
under the Credit Agreements and the Existing Notes) of the Company;

    - _pari passu as to the Collateral owned by the Company with the Indebtedness under the Credit_
Agreements and all future Indebtedness of the Company secured by a first-priority Lien on the Collateral
owned by the Company;


-----

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company (including
Indebtedness under the Existing Notes) and junior priority secured Indebtedness, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral securing the Notes;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Company that is secured by Liens
on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company;

    - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are not
Guarantors.

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. From and after the Completion
Date, each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be:

    - a general senior secured obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral, subject to certain Liens permitted under the Indenture;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness (including guarantees of_
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and the Existing Notes) of such Guarantor;

    - _pari passu as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with the Guarantee of such Guarantor under the_
Credit Agreements and all future Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a first-priority Lien on the
Collateral owned by such Guarantor;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including the
Guarantee of Indebtedness under the Existing Notes) and junior priority secured Indebtedness, to the
extent of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens
on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock, of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due
until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment
as a result of any such delay.

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000 of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will
mature on November 28, 2028. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum and will be payable,
in cash, semi-annually in arrears on         and         of each year, commencing on        , 2024, to Holders
of record on the immediately preceding         and        , respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from
the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance.


-----

If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is after the record date and on or
before the corresponding interest payment date, then interest shall be paid in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Company may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide for the issuance of Additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the Notes offered
hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. It is intended, to the maximum extent
possible, that any such Additional Notes will be part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture
for all purposes, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that Additional Notes
will not be issued with the same CUSIP as the Notes offered hereby unless such Additional Notes are part of the same
issue as the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Any issuance of Additional Notes will be
subject to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Company
maintained for such purpose (along with any other paying agent maintained by the Company, the “Paying Agent”) or,
at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect
to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise
designated by the Company, the Company’s office or agency maintained for such purpose will be the office of the
Trustee.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes may be consummated prior to the consummation of the AMC Acquisition. If the Issue Date
occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, the Company will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented
or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) on the Issue Date among the Company, the Trustee and
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow
Agent”), pursuant to which an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date
will be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall
be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow
Agreement.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes,
which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Price payable
upon such Special Mandatory Redemption for the Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, the
Company will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the
amount of the Escrowed Property, plus certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, Notes Collateral Agent and Escrow
Agent pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and
other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Notes (less any property and/or
funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” The
Escrowed Property will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.
Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount
equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as


-----

applicable, prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Notes
under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.”

Other than in connection with the payment of a semi-annual interest payment as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity
and Interest” and pursuant to the previous paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to
release the Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company)
(the “Escrow Release”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to July 5, 2024 (such date the “Escrow Outside
_Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall_
be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, to the effect that the AMC Acquisition will be consummated
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release.

The Escrow Release will occur promptly following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Escrow Release Officer’s
Certificate (the date of the Escrow Release, the “Escrow Release Date”). Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed
Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account
will be reduced to zero.

The Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders, subject to certain liens of the Escrow
Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price of the Notes; provided, however that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released
and terminate at such time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the Escrow Release
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, such liens and security interests will be permitted under the Indenture. The Escrow
Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including
bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Company
will from time to time direct in writing. In the absence of such investment direction, the Escrowed Property will remain
uninvested in cash.

In the event that (i) the Acquisition Date has not occurred on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date, (ii) the Company
notifies the Trustee in writing prior to the Escrow Outside Date that the Company will not pursue the consummation
of the AMC Acquisition or (iii) the Acquisition Agreement has been terminated prior to the Escrow Outside Date
without the consummation of the AMC Acquisition (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”),
the Company will redeem the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and_
unpaid interest on the Notes, if any, from the Issue Date, or the most recent date to which interest has been paid on
the Notes, whichever is later, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the
Indenture and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the third Business Day after
such notice is given by the Company (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”) in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC. On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying
Agent for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes.

**Guarantees**

From and after the Completion Date, the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be jointly
and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by each existing and
future (x) Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary and (x) wholly owned Foreign
Subsidiary that is incorporated in a Covered Jurisdiction, in each case that Guarantees the Company’s obligations
under the Credit Agreements (the “Guarantors”). Following the Completion Date, Subsidiaries of the Company will
be required to Guarantee the Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.”

On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, as
applicable, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have had 4% of our total assets and would have generated 16% of
our pro forma revenues and 11% of our Pro Forma Run Rate Cash EBITDA (as defined in this offering memorandum).


-----

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference, including
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to
comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes—A court could cancel the notes, the related guarantees or the liens securing the notes and/or the guarantees
under fraudulent transfer laws.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the
sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor,
in each case, to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not
prohibited by the Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or
the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
Discharge”;

(4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of
clause (i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to
in such clause;

(5) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of its
obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment (i) by the Company of any Indebtedness of the
Company under the Credit Agreements or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor
(each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or
a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,”
by the Company or the applicable Guarantor of the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i)
or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release
subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release);

(6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee
shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” or in accordance with the provisions of the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding
debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders. The Notes and
each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures.
Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation will be subject to a number of significant exceptions.


-----

Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that
are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, the Notes will be secured only by a first-priority security interest
in the Escrow Account and all funds on deposit therein.

From and after the Completion Date, the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will be secured on a pari passu basis with
the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and the Term Loan Credit Agreement Obligations by perfected firstpriority security interests in the same assets and property of the Company and the Guarantors and to the extent
constituting Collateral that secures the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and the Term Loan Credit Agreement
Obligations. The First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders have rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral that, if exercised, could also adversely affect the value of the Collateral benefiting the Holders, particularly
the rights described below under “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Company and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which could share
in the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations and other Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. With
respect to the Company and the Guarantors, the amount of such Additional First Lien Obligations and such additional
Obligations will be limited by the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such Additional
First Lien Obligations and such additional Obligations could be significant. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes—The value of the collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our
obligations under the notes.”

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

The Collateral granted by the Company and the Guarantors organized in the United States securing the Notes will not
include any of the following assets, unless otherwise elected by the Company in its sole discretion (the “Excluded
_Property”):_

(i) any property of the Company or a Guarantor with respect to which the creation of a security
interest or Lien by the Company or such Guarantor pursuant to the Notes Security Agreement or any other Notes
Document in the Company’s or such Company’s right, title or interest therein could result in adverse tax
consequences (that are not de minimis) to the parent entity of the Company or its subsidiaries, as reasonably
determined by the Company in consultation with the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent;

(ii) any vehicles, airplanes and other assets subject to certificates of title;

(iii) letter-of-credit rights except to the extent constituting supporting obligations;

(iv) any property subject to a purchase money agreement, capital lease or similar arrangement
permitted under the Indenture to the extent the creation of a security interest therein is prohibited thereby or creates a
right of termination in favor of any other party thereto or otherwise requires third party consent thereunder (other
than the Company, any Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary);

(v) (x) all leasehold interests in real property (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any requirement
to obtain any landlord or other third party waivers, estoppels, consents or collateral access letters in respect of such
leasehold interests) and (y) any parcel of real estate owned in fee by the Company or any Guarantor;

(vi) any “intent to use” Trademark application filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
unless and until an amendment to allege use or a statement of use has been filed with, and accepted by, the United


-----

States Patent and Trademark Office to the extent, if any, that and solely during the period, if any, in which the grant
of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such “intent to use” Trademark
application or any registration issuing therefore under federal law;

(vii) any charter, permit, franchise, authorization, lease, license or agreement (and the assets subject
thereto at the time of the acquisition of such assets), in each case, only to the extent that the grant of a security
interest therein by the Company or the applicable Guarantor (x) would violate, or would invalidate, such charter,
permit, franchise, authorization, lease, license, or agreement or result in the creation of a security interest thereunder
or (y) would give any party (other than the Company, a Guarantor or other subsidiary of the Company) to any such
charter, permit, franchise, authorization, lease, license or agreement the right to terminate its obligations thereunder
or (z) is permitted under such charter, permit, franchise, lease, license or agreement only with consent of the parties
thereto (other than consent of the Company, a Guarantor or other subsidiary of the Company) and such necessary
consents to such grant of a security interest have not been obtained (it being understood and agreed that the Notes
Security Agreement does not create any obligation to obtain such consents) other than, in each case referred to in
clauses (x) and (y) and (z), as would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the
Uniform Commercial Code of any relevant jurisdiction);

(viii) any commercial tort claim with a claim value of less than $20,000,000;

(ix) any Excluded Stock and Stock Equivalents;

(x) any assets with respect to which, the Company and the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent reasonably determine the burden or cost (including adverse tax, regulatory, accounting or other consequences
(that are not de minimis)) of granting or perfecting a security interest in favor of the First Lien Notes Secured Parties
under the Notes Collateral Documents outweighs the benefits to be obtained by the First Lien Notes Secured Parties
therefrom;

(xi) any property of the Company or a Guarantor with respect to which the creation of a security
interest or lien therein by the Company or such Guarantor pursuant to the Notes Security Agreement or any other
Notes Document in the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s right, title or interest therein that could result in adverse
accounting or regulatory consequences, as reasonably determined by the Company;

(xii) except as set forth in the Notes Security Agreement with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor, any assets located or titled outside of the United States or assets that require action under the law of any
non-U.S. jurisdiction to create or perfect a security interest in such assets, including, but subject to the terms of the
Notes Security Agreement, any intellectual property registered in any non-U.S. jurisdiction (and no security
agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be required);

(xiii) cash and deposit, securities and commodity accounts (including securities entitlements and related
assets credited thereto), other than to the extent constituting proceeds of Collateral that are not otherwise Excluded
Property; and

(xiv) any property or assets with respect to which granting a security interest in such assets is prohibited
by law (including all applicable laws and regulations restricting assignments of, and security interests in,
government receivables) or agreement binding on such property or asset at the time of its acquisition, or which could
require obtaining the consent, approval, license or authorization of any governmental authority or other third party
pursuant to such agreement (unless such consent, approval, license or authorization has been received; provided that
there shall be no obligation to obtain such consent) or create a right of termination in favor of any such
governmental or third party, in each case after giving effect to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform
Commercial Code or other applicable law;

provided that with respect to clauses (vii) and (xiv), such property shall be Excluded Property only to the extent and
for so long as such prohibition, violation, invalidation or consent right, as applicable, is in effect; provided, further,
that proceeds of and products from any and all of the foregoing that would otherwise constitute Excluded Property
shall also not be considered Collateral and proceeds and products from any and all of the of the foregoing that do not


-----

otherwise constitute Excluded Property shall be considered Collateral; provided, further, that in no event shall any
asset of any Guarantor which secures the obligations under any Credit Agreement constitute Excluded Property. In
addition, the Collateral granted by the Guarantors incorporated in a Covered Jurisdiction securing the Notes will not
include certain assets which will be described in the U.K. Debenture.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the following proviso) will not be
required to be in place on the Completion Date and will not be perfected on such date, but will be required to be put
in place no later than 90 days after the Completion Date or such later date as agreed to by the First Lien Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent; provided, however, the perfection of the security interests in assets with respect to which
a Lien may be perfected (x) by the filing of a UCC financing statement (or equivalent), which UCC financing statement
(or equivalent) will be required to be filed as of the Completion Date or (y) by the delivery of certificates, if any,
representing the Equity Interests of the Company and certain Subsidiaries which such certificates will be required to
be delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent (or the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent) on the Completion
Date to the extent possession of such certificates perfects a security interest therein and to the extent such certificates
of such Subsidiaries have been received after the Company’s use of commercially reasonable efforts.

In addition:

(i) the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent may grant extensions of time (including after the
expiration of any relevant period, which may apply retroactively) for the creation and perfection of security interests
in, or obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets and
such extension shall automatically apply to the equivalent provisions under the Notes Collateral Documents;

(ii) any Lien required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture and/or any action
requested in connection therewith shall be subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes Collateral
Documents;

(iii) neither the Company, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary (other than with respect to the assets of and
equity interests issued by a Guarantor that is a Foreign Subsidiary, including the UK Guarantors on the Completion
Date) shall be required to take any action outside the United States to guarantee the First Lien Notes Obligations or
grant, maintain or perfect (including with respect to any intellectual property registered outside the United States)
any security interest in the Collateral (including the execution of any agreement, document or other instrument
governed by the law of any jurisdiction other than the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia);

(iv) no environmental reports shall be required to be delivered under the Indenture or under any other
Notes Document;

(v) no control agreements or perfection by “control” with respect to any Collateral shall be required
(including control agreements related to deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts or pledges of
uncertificated securities) (for the avoidance of doubt, other than the delivery of possessory collateral required
pursuant to the Security Documents);

(vi) no landlord waivers, collateral access agreements, bailee waivers or other similar agreements with
respect to the Collateral shall be required under the Indenture or under any other Notes Document;

(vii) no notice to obtain the consent of any governmental authority under the Federal Assignment of
Claims Act (or any state equivalent thereof) shall be required; and

(viii) there shall be no requirement to enter into any source code escrow arrangement (or any obligation
to register Intellectual Property).

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Completion Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Company or any
Guarantor acquires any property or rights which are of a type constituting Collateral under any Notes Collateral


-----

Document (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Property or assets not required to be Collateral
pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents), it will be required to execute and deliver such security
instruments, financing statements and such certificates as are required under the Indenture or any Notes Collateral
Document to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a first-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens)
in such after-acquired collateral and to take such actions to add such after-acquired collateral to the Collateral, and
thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed
to relate to such after-acquired collateral to the same extent and with the same force and effect. For the avoidance of
doubt, opinions of counsel will not be required in connection with the addition of new Guarantors or in connection
with the Company or such Guarantors entering into the Notes Collateral Documents or to vest in the Notes Collateral
Agent a perfected security interest in after-acquired collateral owned by the Company or such Guarantors.

**_Further Assurances_**

On or following the Completion Date and subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents,
the Company and the Guarantors shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements (including
continuation statements and amendments to financing statements), agreements, instruments, notices and
acknowledgments and take all further action that may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral
Agent may reasonably request, in order to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the perfection of)
the validity and priority (subject to Permitted Liens) of the security interests created or intended to be created by the
applicable Notes Collateral Documents, all at the expense of the Company.

**_Liens with Respect to the Collateral_**

On the Completion Date, the Company, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into certain Notes
Collateral Documents establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These security
interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the First Lien Notes Obligations of the Company
and the Guarantors.

By their acceptance of the Notes, each Holder will be deemed to accept the terms of, agree to be bound by and authorize
and direct each of the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into and perform its respective
obligations under and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Term Loan Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the First Lien Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent and the administrative agents under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the First Lien
Credit Agreement will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First
_Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral constituting Shared Collateral, which agreement will be_
acknowledged by the Company and the Guarantors and may be amended from time to time without the consent of the
Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Credit
Agreements and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person authorized by it)
may act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor
agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier
of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the
Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent for the Series
of First Lien Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party
shall or shall instruct any Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with
respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to


-----

take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its
security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including
with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien
Document, applicable law or otherwise.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 180-day period
such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after
the occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable Additional First Lien Obligations under
which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative and (b) each Collateral
Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its Additional First Lien Obligations has
occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such NonControlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether
as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents;
_provided, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur_
and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (A) at any time the administrative
agent under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral
Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to Shared Collateral or a material
portion thereof or (B) at any time any the Company or any Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any
Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding.

The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and neither the
Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will have any rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative
or the Controlling Collateral Agent, as applicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (i) in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding, any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien
Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such
First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured
Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such
First Lien Secured Parties; (iii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured
Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or
other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such
First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral; and (iv) any Collateral Agent, any
Authorized Representative, or any other First Lien Secured Party may vote on any plan of reorganization, plan of
liquidation, agreement for composition, or other type of plan of arrangement proposed in or in connection with any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each Series of First Lien Obligations
with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions
of the Applicable Authorized Representative if it is not the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent) may deal
with such Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No NonControlling Collateral Agent, Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in
respect of any Shared Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the
Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other
exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured
Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do
so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or
contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the
First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.


-----

If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared
Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any insolvency and liquidation proceeding
of the Company or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party
receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with
respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral
by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party or received by the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the
case of any such payment, proceeds, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any sale,
collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and any payment or distribution made in respect of Shared
Collateral pursuant to any intercreditor agreement or in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding being collectively
referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied:

(i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such), each
Authorized Representative (in its capacity as such) and the Trustee (in its capacity as such) on a ratable basis pursuant
to the terms of any applicable First Lien Document,

(ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of the First Lien
Obligations of each Series on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given
Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; _provided, that, following the_
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, solely for
the purpose of this paragraph and not any other document, in the event that the value of the Shared Collateral is not
sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Sections
506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other
bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of
First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Sections
506(a) and (b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other
bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and

(iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their successors
or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court
of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess
of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with the
waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit
of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has
a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but
senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other
Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or
Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral
or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment
exists.

The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) shall
bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of
such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another
Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected
security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis
ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any
other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien
Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or
(b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any


-----

Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely
by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien
Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien
Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of
such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such
Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable
law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of
any bankruptcy law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First Lien Obligations
shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute or assert in any suit, insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other
proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages
from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral
and none of the Controlling Collateral Agent, any Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Lien
Secured Party shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Controlling Collateral Agent, such
Applicable Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party with respect to any Shared Collateral in
accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if not the Controlling Collateral
Agent, none of the First Lien Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any
foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral.

If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or
payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights
available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of
remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of the
First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien
Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the
Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above.

If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared
Collateral resulting in a sale, transfer or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of
First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when,
but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and
discharged; provided, that (i) the Liens in favor of each Collateral Agent for the benefit of each related Series of First
Lien Secured Parties secured by such Shared Collateral attach to any such proceeds of such sale or disposition with
the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties as existed prior to the commencement of such sale
or other disposition, and any such Liens shall remain subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
until application thereof pursuant to the waterfall provisions above and (ii) any proceeds of any Shared Collateral
realized therefrom shall be allocated and applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above.

_Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that it shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become
subject to a case or proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law
and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or
more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other bankruptcy law, each Authorized Representative (other
than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to
any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use
of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent shall then oppose or object
(or join in or support any objection) to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral
(and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the
benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First
Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared


-----

Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien
Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien
Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the
First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared
Collateral as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the
benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising
after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties
(other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any
additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in
connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien
Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth
in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied
to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each
case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral for such Series that is not
Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted
adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of
cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in
each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration for Collateral of such
Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the
grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured
Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further,
that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to or oppose (or support any other
Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to
any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of
cash collateral.

The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents,
be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or
otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of
proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights
of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

**_Release or Subordination of Collateral_**

The release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Lien securing the First Lien Notes Obligations
shall occur automatically and without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the Holders under
any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable the Company and/or one or more Guarantors to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of capital leases or the repossession of the leased property
in a capital lease by the lessor) of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Company or a
Guarantor) to the extent consummated in accordance with, or not prohibited by, the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(2) in the case any Collateral becomes Excluded Property;

(3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

(4) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status;


-----

(5) if all other liens on such Collateral securing First Lien Obligations are released or will be released
simultaneously therewith (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment in full and irrevocable
termination of such First Lien Obligations);

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below; and

(7) in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the related Note Guarantees also will be released automatically
and without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the Holders (i) upon payment in full of the
principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the
related Note Guarantees and the Notes Collateral Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such
principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance
under the Indenture as described below under “Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture as described under “—
Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (4) above, if, after achievement of Investment Grade Status, two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch
withdraw Investment Grade Status or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating,
the Company and the Guarantors shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide to the Notes Collateral Agent
for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes valid, perfected, first priority security interests
(subject to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter.

In addition, upon the request of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, the Notes Collateral Agent may be required
to subordinate its Lien over certain Collateral to certain other Permitted Liens over such Collateral, including Liens
securing Purchase Money Indebtedness or Finance Leases, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability
to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors.
The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but
not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By
their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner.
In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest
or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeds
the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first-priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral),
or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by any applicable bankruptcy law
in the event that any bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be commenced by or
against the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the
Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior
bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning
of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made
following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether


-----

or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral
at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any
delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of
post-petition interest, expenses, costs and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the
extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of all of the obligations secured by the collateral on a pari passu or senior
basis.

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not
sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a
_pari passu or senior basis), the First Lien Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the_
value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect
to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to       , 2025, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice
as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such
Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date.

At any time and from time to time on or after       , 2025, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal
amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on         of the year indicated
below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2025 ......................................................................................................................................................... 103.000%
2026 ......................................................................................................................................................... 102.000%
2027 and thereafter .................................................................................................................................. 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to       , 2025, the Company may redeem Notes with the net cash proceeds
received by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to         % of the principal amount
of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal
amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on the Issue
Date (together with Additional Notes); provided that

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering, and

(2) not less than 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently.

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to         , 2025, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture (including Additional
Notes) during each twelve-month period commencing from the Completion Date, upon notice as described under “—
Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer
or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making
such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by
such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early
tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. In determining whether the Holders of
at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned
by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor
thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a
corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control Triggering
Event or other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or
purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by
electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur
and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that
payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may
be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the
Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to
redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Company is not
required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However,
under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the captions
“—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The
Company and its equityholders, including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of the Company’s
management, may at any time and from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans,
including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any
applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases
made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt,
including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually
or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular
class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such
purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result
in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax
consequences to us.


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption in
compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified
to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not so listed or
such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no
method of selection, the Trustee will select by lot or on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an
unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of $2,000 in
aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or, at the Company’s option, mailed by first-class mail at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
with a copy to the Trustee, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60
days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name
of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company
defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless a third party makes a Change
of Control Offer described below or the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the
Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control
_Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if_
any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of
Control Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer
electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee,
to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control
Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional
Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The
Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under
the Credit Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future


-----

Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes
could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes
may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of
incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between
the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. The Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving
a Change of Control Triggering Event after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Company could decide to
do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect
our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in
the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event
if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable
redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the
applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control
Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes
may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

A sale, lease or other disposition by the Company of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale,
lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the
assets retained by the Company exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any
other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such
assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Company’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than
substantially all of its assets.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.


-----

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on a relevant record date to
receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts
(as defined below), if any, then due or which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or other official

administrative guidance promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined
below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official application, administration or interpretation of such

laws, treaties, regulations, or other official administrative guidance (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative guidance) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer
or any Guarantor, as applicable (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where
this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective after the Issue
Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue
Date, after such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person,
after such successor Person becomes a successor Issuer or Guarantor, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring
after the time such successor Person becomes a successor Issuer or Guarantor (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a later date, after such later date).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be distributed in accordance with the procedures described under “—
Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days
prior to the earliest date on which the applicable Issuer or the Guarantor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the distribution of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied
and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or Guarantor taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under
the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Issuer or a Guarantor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as
a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry,
in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (a “Payor”) with respect to any Note or Note
Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes
(including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto) unless the withholding or deduction
of such taxes is required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any taxes imposed or levied
by or on behalf of any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia):


-----

(1) from or through which payment on any Note or any Note Guarantee is made or any political

subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the
jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is at any relevant time incorporated or organized, engaged in

business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1)
and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made by any applicable withholding agent in respect of any payments made
by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without
limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Issuer or such Guarantor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received by each beneficial owner in respect of such payments (i.e., the Person treated as the owner
of such payments for purposes of the applicable tax), after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been
received by such beneficial owner in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of
any such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that (A) if a beneficial owner is not the holder of the Notes,
the Additional Amounts payable to such beneficial owner in respect of any tax shall not exceed the Additional
Amounts that would have been payable to such beneficial owner in respect of such tax had the beneficial owner been
the holder and (B) no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any taxes, to the extent such taxes would not have been so imposed, deducted or withheld but for

the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes,
or being or having been a citizen or domiciliary or resident or national of, or carrying on a business
or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of management in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection
arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes
Guarantee thereof;

(2) any taxes, to the extent such taxes are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the

holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Guarantor
(reasonable notice at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to
provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality,
residence or identity of the holder or such beneficial owner, which is required by a law, treaty,
regulation or official administrative guidance of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition
to any applicable exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such tax;

(3) any taxes, to the extent such taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment

(where Notes are in definitive form and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later
of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding in respect of a payment with

respect to any Note or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar taxes; or

(6) any combination of the items (1) through (5) above.


-----

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. In such event,
the Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies
of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the
Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable request and will be made available
at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note
Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to
be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the
relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter).
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate
as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee thereof,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or
levies (including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property
or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement
of, or receipt of payments in respect of any Notes, any Notes Guarantee thereof, the Indenture, or any other document
or instrument in relation thereto (limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from
the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are
not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6)).

The foregoing obligations under this section entitled “—Additional Amounts” will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis
mutandis to any successor to the Issuer or any Guarantor and to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer
or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to any Note or any Note
Guarantees is made by or on behalf of such Person, or, in each case, any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt,
the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:


-----

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following headings
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

        - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

        - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

        - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

        - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

        - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

        - “—Limitation on Guarantees”; and

        - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation and
Consolidation.”

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be
reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine
compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status
and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in
effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event
of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any
liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions
taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date that were permitted at such
time, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants
remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the
Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of “—
Limitation on Indebtedness.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as
Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction
entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be
deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second
paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation
on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period
will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second
paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future
obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees
shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the


-----

Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension
Period.

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions
contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such
consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the
ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the
occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have occurred.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur_
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio
would have been no greater than 6.25 to 1.00; _provided,_ _further, that Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may not Incur_
Indebtedness under this paragraph if, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the greater of (a) $310.0 million and (b) 40.0%
of LTM EBITDA of Indebtedness of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would be outstanding pursuant to this paragraph at
such time.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(1) (X) Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit
Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, up to an aggregate principal amount equal
to the sum of (I) the greater of (a) $3,435.0 million and (b) the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could incur such that the Consolidated First Lien
Secured Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than (A) 5.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis or (B) to the
extent such Indebtedness is Incurred or issued to finance an acquisition or Investment, the greater
of (i) 5.00 to 1.00 and (ii) the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio immediately prior to
the incurrence of such Indebtedness (provided that, for purposes of determining the amount that
may be Incurred under this clause (I)(b), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (I)(b) shall be
deemed to be secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank pari passu with the Liens securing the
First Lien Obligations (without regard to control of remedies) whether or not so secured), plus (II)
the greater of $775.0 million and 100.0% of LTM EBITDA, in each case, outstanding at any one
time, and (Y) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause or any
portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest,
premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with
such refinancing, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_


-----

any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and

any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Existing Notes, (b) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes),
including any Guarantee thereof, (c) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant
to clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)(a) or (4)(b) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date or solely
with respect to Indebtedness of AMC, the Completion Date and any Guarantee thereof, (d)
Refinancing Indebtedness (including, with respect to the Notes and any Guarantee thereof) Incurred
in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) or clause (2), (5) or (10) of this paragraph
or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and (e) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition (including a Permitted Change of Control) or Investment or (y) Persons that are acquired
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (including
designating an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that such Indebtedness
is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the greater of $310.0 million and 40.0% of LTM EBITDA
at any time outstanding plus (ii) unlimited additional Indebtedness if after giving pro forma effect
to such acquisition, Permitted Change of Control, merger, amalgamation or consolidation, either

the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,

either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be lower or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than it was immediately prior to
such acquisition, Permitted Change of Control, merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or

such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred in
contemplation of the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary); provided that, in the case of this clause (c), the only obligors with
respect to such Indebtedness shall be those Persons who were obligors of such Indebtedness
prior to such acquisition, such Permitted Change of Control), merger, amalgamation or
consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness (i) represented by Finance Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of
all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the
amount of Finance Lease Obligations and Purchase Money Obligations outstanding on the Issue
Date plus the greater of (a) $272.5 million and (b) 35.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of incurrence
(for the avoidance of doubt, Unsecured Finance Leases shall be permitted in an unlimited amount
pursuant to clause (23)), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and (ii) arising out of
Sale and Leaseback Transactions;


-----

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, health, disability or other employee
benefits, property, casualty or liability insurance, self-insurance obligations, customer guarantees,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, bid, appeal, advance payment (including progress
premiums), customs, value added or other Tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice; (b) the honoring by a bank or other financial
institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice; (c) customer deposits and advance payments
(including progress premiums) received in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice from customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice; (d) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, discounted bills of
exchange, discounting or factoring of receivables or payables for credit management purposes,
warehouse receipts, guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or entered into, or
relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice; (e) Cash Management Obligations; and (f) Settlement Indebtedness;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earn-outs, deferred purchase price or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case,
similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or
disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than
Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets
or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the
maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness
in connection with a disposition shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market
value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any
subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets
the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs
of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time
reclassify, such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) and only be required to include the
amount and type of such Indebtedness in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having been
Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this
covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision and
any related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification (it being understood that
any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant
shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but shall be deemed
incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which
the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first
paragraph of this covenant without reliance on such clause);

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or Completion Date, as applicable, under the Credit
Agreements shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1)(X)(I)(a) of
the second paragraph of the description of this covenant;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums),
defeasance costs, fees and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;


-----

(9) for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in connection with the incurrence, issuance or assumption of any
Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the incurrence or creation of any
Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens” or otherwise, the Company may elect, at its
option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any
commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed
amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being
incurred as of such election date, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First
Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the
Indenture, as applicable, is complied with (or satisfied) with respect thereto on such election date,
any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant or
the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other
provision of the Indenture, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is
complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (including as to the absence of any continuing Default
or Event of Default);

(10) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with
any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any
actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance
or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the
Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of
determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or
transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture
shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable
declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition
to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a
“Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent announcement in
another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition
Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction
and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence,
issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation
of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma
adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take
such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with
such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket
(and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or
satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is
committed, issued, assumed or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided,
that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become
available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or
baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall
thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except
as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any
related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable
LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto
(including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and
the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments
and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge


-----

Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the
Company.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests
or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any
time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as
a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or
Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such
baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied
with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to
the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was
determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have
been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or
Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be
complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have
occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in
connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction
following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited
Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for
redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition
Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated,
expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition
is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any
such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited
Condition Transaction;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of
additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not
treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes
of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall
be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the
case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable


-----

U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long
as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on
the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely
because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is
guaranteed by different obligors.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Company’s or any

defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause
(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment;

be internal financial statements) (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is
a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(iii) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash, and the fair market value of property or
assets or marketable securities, received by the Company from the issue or sale of
its Capital Stock or as the result of a merger or consolidation with another Person

case other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (including the aggregate

consideration any Indebtedness associated with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so
designated or merged, amalgamated or consolidated or Indebtedness associated
with the assets so transferred), other than to the extent of the amount of the
Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment or was made under clause (16)

Our Restricted Payments capacity pursuant to the foregoing clause (b) (excluding clause (b)(i)) as of December 31,
2023 was approximately $90 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at
the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture or

such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture as if it were and is deemed
at such time to be a Restricted Payment at the time of such notice;

or advances to, any Parent Entity of the Company in amounts required for any such Parent Entity
(or such Parent Entity’s equity owners) to pay:

sufficient to allow each such equity owner to receive an amount at least equal to the
aggregate amount of its out-of-pocket costs to any unaffiliated third parties directly
attributable to creating (including any incorporation or registration fees) and maintaining
the existence of the applicable equity owner, and legal and accounting and other costs
directly attributable to maintaining its corporate, legal, or organizational existence and

warrants, options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock of
the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company; and

repurchases deemed to occur upon the cashless exercise of stock or other equity options.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (a) in the event that a Restricted Payment or Investment
(or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the clauses
above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in
the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Company will be entitled to divide or classify such Restricted Payment
or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part
in its sole discretion (based on circumstances existing on the date of such division, classification or reclassification)
such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including
as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment” and (b)
any amount permitted by this covenant shall be reduced by any corresponding amount of Indebtedness outstanding


-----

that was incurred pursuant to clause (20) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted
Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted
Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets
other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, the Company or
applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the commitment,
definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving pro forma effect
to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma adjustments, the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment on the relevant
Election Date in compliance with the Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making of such Investment will be
deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been made on such Election Date, including for purposes of
calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable) and Consolidated
EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of Default (and all such
calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission, retraction or
rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma basis giving
effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted
Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any
of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer
will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions in amounts
sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent Entity, the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness
on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Lien on any Collateral, (i) such Subject Lien expressly has Junior Lien Priority
on the Collateral relative to the Note and related Note Guarantees or (ii) such Lien is a Permitted
Lien; or

(2) in the case of any Subject Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Notes (or the
Note Guarantee in the case of Subject Lien on assets or property of a Guarantor) are equally and
ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures any Subordinated
Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien until such time as such Obligations are
no longer secured by such Subject Lien or (ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien.


-----

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph may provide by its
terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge
of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes and the Guarantees.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided_ that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility or (b) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date or, solely with respect to any
agreement or instrument of AMC, the Completion Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Note Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in,
or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired
by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction)
and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the
Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such
Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when
such Person becomes the Successor Company;


-----

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or
encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other
security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; _provided_
that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are subject to such agreement, the payment
rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or
property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another
Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Finance Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions
on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction)
pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
Incurred or issued subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign Subsidiaries
party thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness, shall only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to


-----

the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument
taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Credit Agreements, together with the security documents associated
therewith, or the Indenture as in effect on the Issue Date or Completion Date or (ii) in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of clause (ii), either
(a) the Company determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability
to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) such encumbrance or restriction applies
only during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment relating to such agreement or
instrument;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
Liens”; or

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of
this paragraph or this clause (16); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the
Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis)
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) within 540 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of the
Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition (as may be extended by an Acceptable
Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the “Proceeds Application Period”), an
amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Available Cash (the “Applicable Proceeds”)
is applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects:

(a) (I) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of Collateral, (i) to
prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary (in each case,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) within 540
days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such
Net Available Cash; _provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,_
repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i), the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment


-----

(if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or
purchased; or (ii) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase First Lien Obligations (other than
the Notes), including Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement (or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof); _provided, however, that, in connection with any_
prepayment, repayment or purchase of First Lien Obligations (other than the Notes)
pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such First
Lien Obligations and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount
equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further that, to the
extent the Company reduces, redeems, repays or repurchases such First Lien Obligations
pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under
the Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to
the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by
making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for a Collateral Asset
Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that
would otherwise be prepaid (provided, that if any such offer to purchase any Notes is made,
such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the amount of such offer, whether or
not accepted by the holders of such Notes); and

(II) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of assets or property
that do not constitute Collateral, (w) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness
secured by a Lien on such asset, (x) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu
Indebtedness; provided, that the Company ratably repay the Notes, (y) to make an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to redeem
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” or purchase Notes through openmarket purchases or in privately negotiated transactions, or (z) to reduce, prepay, repay or
purchase any Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed
to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided, however, that, in connection with
any reduction, prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (a)(II), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and
will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so reduced, prepaid, repaid or purchased (provided, further, that if any such offer
to purchase any Notes is made, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of the
amount of such offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Notes); and

(b) to invest (including capital expenditures) in (or has previously invested in (so long as such
investment was made or committed to within 90 days prior to the receipt of the proceeds
from the applicable Asset Disposition)) or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including
by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the
amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary)
within 540 days from the later of (after giving effect to any Acceptable Commitment or
Second Commitment (each as defined below), the “Application Period”) (i) the date of
such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash
from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to
Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such
commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event of any Acceptable
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied
in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another
Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation
or termination; _provided further_ that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash
shall constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds or Excess Proceeds, as the case may be; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing;


-----

_provided_ that (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this
covenant, the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Applicable Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness (including under the Credit Facilities) or otherwise apply such Applicable Proceeds in any manner
not prohibited by the Indenture, and (2) the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to
invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given Asset Disposition
(provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset
Disposition, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition, and consummation of the relevant
Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above
with respect to such Asset Disposition.

“Applicable Percentage” means 100%; _provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be_
continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio would be
less than or equal to 5.70 to 1.00 but greater than 5.20 to 1.00, or (2) 0.00% if, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio would be less
than or equal to 5.20 to 1.00. Any Net Available Cash in respect of an Asset Disposition that does not constitute
Applicable Proceeds as a result of the application of this definition shall collectively constitute “Total Leverage Excess
_Proceeds.”_

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition of Collateral, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect
to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of
LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of
LTM EBITDA, “Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess
of the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Collateral Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the
limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Company shall make an offer (a “Collateral Asset
_Disposition Offer”) no later than ten business days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all_
Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any First Lien Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders
of such First Lien Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes,
First Lien Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of
such Collateral Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100%
of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100%
of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to First Lien
Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but
not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture
and the agreement governing the First Lien Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of a Collateral Asset
Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days
before the purchase date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation
with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making a Collateral Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the
Proceeds Application Period (the “Collateral Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds
(the “Collateral Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any other First
Lien Obligations or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in
connection with a Collateral Asset Disposition Offer made with Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a
Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in a Collateral Asset
Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Collateral
Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) in Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined
Collateral Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, First Lien Obligations or Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Collateral Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Collateral
Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion), the Company shall
allocate the Collateral Excess Proceeds among the Notes, First Lien Obligations and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of
tendered Notes, First Lien Obligations and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes, First Lien Obligations or


-----

other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of
any Collateral Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Collateral Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero.

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition of assets or property that do not constitute Collateral, at the expiration of the
Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of
the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the
greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable
Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then
subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Company shall make an offer (an
“Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten business days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to
all Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate,
on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the
Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness
was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any
(or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other
Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of an Asset Disposition Offer
shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase
date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the
Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period
(the “Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of
being required to do so by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and, if applicable, any other Pari
Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Disposition Offer made
with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in an
Asset Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess Proceeds for any purpose
not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the
Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall allocate the
Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided
that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at
zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash or Applicable Percentage payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into Dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash or
Applicable Percentage of any Asset Disposition is received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary or a
CFC Holding Company (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted
by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or
administrative impediments, in each case, from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion
of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such
amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company so long, but only so long,
as the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments
will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined
in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC
Holding Company to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been


-----

required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or regulation, applicable
organizational documents or other impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date
on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net
Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment,
such repatriation will be promptly effected and an amount equal to such repatriated Net Available Cash will be
promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net
of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs)
in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation
of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an
adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby
doing so the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates and /or direct or indirect equity
owners would incur a Tax liability, including receipt of a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Section 956 of
the Code or a withholding Tax), an amount equal to the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the
applicable Foreign Subsidiary or CFC Holding Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall
require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are
used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of
doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor) or the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from
the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing
of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding,
not to exceed the greater of $137.5 million and 17.5% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value
of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act,
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.


-----

The Credit Agreements may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company
becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event
the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the
purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does
not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case,
the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction
(including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of
the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of $82.5 million and
10.5% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
$117.5 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this paragraph
if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment or other transaction permitted to be made or undertaken pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (including Permitted Payments)
or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock other than Disqualified Stock, options, other equityrelated interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or
otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment,
consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust
or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights
to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted
stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, _provided_
that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation
is otherwise consummated in compliance with the Indenture;


-----

(5) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees (or their respective
Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company, any Parent Entity
or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled
Investment Affiliate or Immediate Family Member of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date or, solely with respect to
agreements or instruments of AMC, the Completion Date, as these agreements and instruments may
be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the
Holders in any material respect;

disposition or acquisition of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in
connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, vendors, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors,
distributors or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of
the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity solely because the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or
similar entity;

(10) issuances, transfers or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and the
granting of registration and other customary rights (and the performance of the related obligations)
in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or distributions or dividends by the
Company in lieu of such payments) to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly),

consulting, monitoring, transaction, advisory, indemnities and other fees, costs and expenses
accrued in any prior year) and any exit and termination fees (including any such cash lump sum or
present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an initial public offering
and a SPAC IPO) pursuant to any management services or similar agreements or the management

under the terms of, any equityholders, investor rights or similar agreement (including any

existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations
under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered
into after the Issue Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of any
such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect;

In addition, if the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (i) purchases or otherwise acquires assets or properties

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not
cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value
of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce
the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted
Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be
permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would
not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was not prohibited
by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at
any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it
will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such
designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
(including pursuant to clause 5(b) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the Trustee by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and quarterly
reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Issue Date, the Company will

required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form (if the Company
had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act); _provided, that the_
foregoing shall not obligate the Company to make available (i) any information otherwise required
to be included on a Form 8-K regarding the occurrence of any such events if the Company
determines in its good faith judgment that such event or such information that would otherwise be
required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders or the business, assets, operations, financial
positions or prospects of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) a
summary of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or
understanding between the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or
executive officer of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries), (iii) copies of any agreements,

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions,

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form, except
as described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the offering
memorandum; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide (i) any information that is not
otherwise similar to information currently included in the offering circular, (ii) separate financial statements or other
information contemplated by Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10, Rule 3-16 or Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X, or in each


-----

case any successor provisions or any schedules required by Regulation S-X, (iii) information required by Regulation
G under the Exchange Act or Item 10, Item 302, Item 402 or Item 601 of Regulation S-K (or any successor provision),
(iv) XBRL exhibits, (v) earnings per share information, (vi) information regarding executive compensation and related
party disclosure related to SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A, (vii) climate-related disclosures
related to SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, including, without limitation, any information, reports or
exhibits required by Article 14 of Regulation S-X or Item 1506 of Regulation S-K and (viii) other information
customarily excluded from an offering memorandum, including any information that is not otherwise of the type and
form currently included in the offering memorandum relating to the Notes. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of
Regulation S-K (or any successor provision). To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as
applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as
applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any
Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the
rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total
outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or
cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not otherwise satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree
that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective
investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of
such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic, require a
confidentiality acknowledgement and may be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access will be
given to Holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to
“qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined
in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company),
and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of an investment in the Notes) and market making financial
institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts and market making financial institutions, reasonably satisfactory
to the Company. To the extent the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the
manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the Company shall
furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon their request. The Company may condition the delivery of any
such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Notes, and securities analysts and market making financial
institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and
information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports (and the information contained therein) and information for any
purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports
(and the information contained therein) and information; and the Company may deny access to any competitivelysensitive information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any Holder, bona fide
prospective investors, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
extent that the Company determines in good faith that the provision of such information and reports to such Person
would be competitively harmful to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in the Notes
and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the previous
quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the Company’s
(or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call will be following the
last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10 Business Days from the time that the Company
distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No fewer than two days prior to the
conference call, the Company will issue a press release or otherwise announce the time and date of such conference
call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective investors and market making financial
institutions to obtain access to such call.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries
hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial


-----

information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information
relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; _provided_ that the same is
accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information
relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information, if any), on the
one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the
other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding
sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity has furnished the
Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Company
or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports delivered to it. Delivery of reports, information and
documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s
receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or
determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

From and after the Completion Date, the Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries
that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and (i) non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned
Domestic Subsidiaries guarantee, or are a co-issuer of, other capital markets debt securities of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or guarantee all or a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, any Credit Agreement or (ii) Foreign
Subsidiaries if such Foreign Subsidiaries guarantee all or a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, any Credit
Agreement), other than a Guarantor, to Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor,
unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary and joinders to the applicable
Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents, except that with respect to a
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express
terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against
the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted
Subsidiary under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture.

_Provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the_
time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of,
such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the Company’s obligations
under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any of its
Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary


-----

or Parent Entity shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period described above and such Guarantee may (so
long as at such time no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom and such
Subsidiary is otherwise not required to be a Guarantor) be released at any time in the Company’s sole discretion so
long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary then outstanding could have been incurred by such Subsidiary (either (x)
when so incurred or (y) at the time of the release of such Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary were not a Guarantor
at such time.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by delivery of a supplemental
indenture and joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents executed by
the Company, to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to automatically
and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that
such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if
such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a
Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture and joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new
Notes Collateral Documents); provided that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to Guarantee the Credit
Agreements or other Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors, unless it again becomes a Guarantor.

**_Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America,_
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the
Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture and joinders to the applicable Notes
Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents, executed and delivered to the Trustee
and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes
and the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents and if such Successor Company
is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), none of the Events of Default described
in clauses (1), (2) or (5) thereof shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) upon execution of an agreement to enter into such transaction, no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction,
either (a) the applicable Successor Company or the Company would be able to Incur at least an
additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Indebtedness,” (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction or (c) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of
Counsel stating that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company,
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to_
any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3) above; and


-----

(5) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Company are
assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Notes Collateral Documents, the
Company or the Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Notes Collateral Document in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or
the applicable Notes Collateral Document and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such
Lien is perfected to the extent required by the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Note Documents, and the Company will automatically and unconditionally be released and
discharged from its obligations under the Note Documents.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, (a) the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor, (b) the Company may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate that is (i) organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
the Company or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia or (ii)
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the
Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company, (c) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company
or a Guarantor, (d) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all
or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (e) the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may complete any Permitted Tax Restructuring or any Permitted Change of Control.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the creation of a
new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_Guarantors_

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or
transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge or amalgamate with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee, the Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents;
and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition or transfer (including by way of
consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer,
lease, sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, any Guarantor may (a) consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Company, (b) consolidate or


-----

otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Guarantor, (c) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized
or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (d) liquidate or dissolve or change its
legal form if the Company determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Company and
(e) complete any Permitted Tax Restructuring or any Permitted Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this covenant, the Company may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Any reference herein to a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer, or similar
term, shall be deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust, or an
allocation of assets to a series of a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust (or the unwinding of such a
division or allocation), as if it were a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer,
or similar term, as applicable, to, of or with a separate Person. Any division of a limited liability company, limited
partnership or trust shall constitute a separate Person hereunder (and each division of any limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust that is a Subsidiary, Restricted Subsidiary, Unrestricted Subsidiary, joint venture or any
other like term shall also constitute such a Person or entity).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not apply to the Transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee
on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture; provided that in the
case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—
Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 180 days after written notice
described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
_default”); or_


-----

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”);_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates to the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such nonpayment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute
a Significant Subsidiary) (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of the greater of $195.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at
the date of such judgment) other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or
insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain
unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes
final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) (i) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other
than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or (ii) a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with
the terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, and, in
each of clauses (i) and (ii), other than in connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as
the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or
ceases to be in full force as a result of a bankruptcy are less than the greater of $195.0 million and
25.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such bankruptcy);

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Notes Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and
perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless
perfection is not required by the Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents) other than (A) in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Collateral Document and the Indenture, (B) the
satisfaction in full of all First Lien Notes Obligations or (C) any loss of perfection that results from
the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent (or its bailee pursuant to the terms of any applicable
intercreditor agreement to which the Notes Collateral Agent is a party) to maintain possession of
certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security Documents and (ii)
such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders
of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes; or

(9) the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in
any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any Notes Collateral
Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release of the Note Guarantee of
such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the release of such security interest
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents).

However, a Default under clause (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default


-----

(with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6), the Company
does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (3) or (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice;
_provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders,_
more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take
any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must
be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the
Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that
such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”),
which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be
deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the
Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction,
to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time
to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of
request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position
Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in
lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and
Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its
Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s
Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination
that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any
Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure
period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such
Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction,
but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure
period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or
Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any
remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall
result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation
of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would
have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio
(other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided
and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such
Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank; provided that if
a Regulated Bank is a Directing Holder or a beneficial owner directing DTC it shall provide a written representation
to the Company that it is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively
rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as
to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant,
verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative
Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee note and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have any liability
to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction.


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event
of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in
each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal
of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may
only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes
and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted
solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—
Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period
in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation.

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested,
provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee
and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or
the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60- day period.


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee
and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable,. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the
Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no
duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture,
each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it
against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence
by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the
Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to
have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has
been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Indenture and
such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained before or after a Change of Control Triggering Event in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained before or after a Change of Control Triggering Event in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other
than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating

supplement or modification in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of the covenants described
above under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants” and clauses (3), (4),


-----

(6) and (7) of “—Events of Default” and the related definitions shall be deemed not to impair the
contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment
on or with respect to such Holder’s Note);

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence; or

of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Notes Collateral Document
or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral with the
effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Obligations in respect of the
Notes or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes in any material
portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as
provided under the terms of the Indenture, the Notes Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee, the Notes Collateral
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents and the Company
may direct the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into an amendment to the Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Guarantor
under any Note Document or to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Merger and Consolidation”;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to alter the
provisions of the Indenture relating to the form of the Notes (including related definitions);

(4) add to or modify the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change (including changing the CUSIP or other identifying number on any Notes) that
would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of any Holder;

(6) at the Company’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is required;

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance
of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add Guarantees with

-----

the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing
the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
or successor Paying Agent thereunder pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(10) secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees or to add collateral thereto;

(11) add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes not prohibited by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended
would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders
to transfer Notes;

(13) comply with the rules and procedures of any applicable securities depositary;

(14) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture, the Guarantees and/or the Notes to
eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or in the application thereof as described in the last
paragraph of the definition of “GAAP”;

(15) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the First Lien Notes Obligations, in any property or assets,
including any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is
required to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to
the Indenture, any of the Notes Collateral Documents or otherwise;

(16) to add Additional First Lien Secured Parties to any Notes Collateral Document;

(17) to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the
Holders as those set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any joinder
thereto;

(18) in the case of any Notes Collateral Document, to include therein any legend required to be set forth
therein pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or to modify any such legend as required
by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(19) to provide for the succession of any parties to any Notes Collateral Document (and other
amendments that are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment,
renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other
modification from time to time of the Credit Agreements or any other agreement that is not
prohibited by the Indenture;

(20) to release Collateral from the Lien securing the First Lien Notes Obligations when permitted or
required by the Indenture or any Notes Collateral Document;

(21) make technical changes required in connection with a Permitted Change of Control.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.


-----

A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender
of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under, “—Certain
Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in effect at the time of such action, shall be deemed to
impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Note Documents
and have liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing
Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the
rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in
connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in
trust.

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Amalgamation and Consolidation—”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such
covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and Significant Subsidiaries,
the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under “—Events of Default” above and have
liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes released (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes so long as no Notes are then outstanding. If
the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant
Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; _provided, that_
upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient
for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of
redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at
least two Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee
of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the
effect that beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income Tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only,
such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income Tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange
of the Notes and indemnification rights of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all Notes and the liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Notes will be released when (1) either
(a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the
Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one
year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the
case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee
equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, as calculated by the Company
or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate, with any Applicable Premium Deficit
only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the
redemption date that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the
Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Company has delivered
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the
“—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have
been complied with; _provided_ that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guarantor under the Note Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed as Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent under the
Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default actually known or
notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default actually known or notified in writing to a
responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The
permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Company,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as
security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company and its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries.


-----

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will
include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company and (2)
that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain
minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or
becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent for any
loss, liability, Taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes are represented
by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the
Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once
on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall
be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed. Any notice or
communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and
shall be sufficiently given to such Person if so mailed within the time prescribed.

Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. Notices to the Trustee shall be
deemed given upon receipt by the Trustee.

extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred under any revolving credit facility unless such
Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced), has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount

guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of

shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued operations
(and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting
therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such period any Person that
subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion, or disposed or discontinued operation
that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the Transactions
or any Permitted Change of Control), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial
or chief accounting officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating
expenses reductions and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect). If any

rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness).
Interest on a Finance Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Finance Lease
Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any
Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this
definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime
or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the
rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

time to time; provided that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used in the Indenture shall be construed, and
all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture shall be made (a) without giving effect to any
election under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 825—Financial Instruments, or any successor thereto or
comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification), to value any
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (b) the amount of any
Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Finance Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the
definition of Finance Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date, the Company may elect to apply IFRS
accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election, references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be
construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided that any such election, once made,
shall be irrevocable; _provided,_ _further, that any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the_
application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Company’s election to apply IFRS
shall remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company shall give notice of any
such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an
election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

of calculation of any standards, terms or measures (including all computations of amounts and ratios) used in the

will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event
of litigation.

This summary deals only with notes that are purchased for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (generally, the
first price at which a substantial amount of the notes are sold for money to investors, not including bond houses,
brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)
and that will be held as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). This summary does not purport to deal with all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address
United States federal income tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules,
including but not limited to banks or other financial institutions; individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts;
tax-exempt entities; S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax
purposes or investors in such entities; insurance companies; regulated investment companies; real estate investment
trusts; broker dealers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies; former citizens or residents of the United States
subject to section 877 of the Code; controlled foreign corporations; non-United States trusts or estates with United
States beneficiaries; passive foreign investment companies; corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United
States federal income tax; taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax; persons required for United States federal
income tax purposes to conform the timing of income accruals to their financial statements under section 451(b) of
the Code; persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax; or U.S. Holders (as defined below) that hold notes
through non-United States brokers or other non-United States intermediaries. This summary also does not discuss
notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, conversion transaction, or other integrated transaction for
tax purposes, or situations in which the “functional currency” of a U.S. Holder is not the United States dollar.
Moreover, the effect of any United States federal taxes other than United States federal income taxes (such as estate
or gift taxes or the 3.8% “Medicare” tax on certain net investment income) and any state, local or non-United States
tax laws is not discussed.

In the case of a beneficial owner of notes that is classified as a partnership (or other pass-through entity) for United
States federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the notes to a partner in the partnership (or other equityholder
in a pass-through entity) generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner (or other equityholder) and the
activities of the partner and the partnership (or other equityholder and the pass-through entity). If you are a partnership
(or other pass-through entity) considering an investment in the notes, then you and your partners (or equityholders)
should consult your own tax advisors.

The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice.
Investors considering the purchase of notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of
the United States federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under
any other United States federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-United States taxing jurisdiction or under
any applicable tax treaty.

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the notes in addition to stated principal and interest
(e.g., in the circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Notes—
Optional Redemption”) or at times other than the stated maturity date and stated interest payment dates. These
potential payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt


-----

instruments,” in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may
be different from the consequences discussed herein. One or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered
remote or incidental. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of
these payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable
Treasury regulations. This position is based on our determination that, as of the issue date of the notes, the possibility
that these payments will have to be made is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable
Treasury regulations.

Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly
discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes that it is taking a different position.
However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, then the
notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a holder subject to United States federal income
taxation may, among other potentially adverse tax consequences, be required to accrue ordinary interest income on
the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate, and to treat any gain recognized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Holders
of notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments for United States federal income tax purposes. Investors in the notes should consult their
own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations for a U.S. Holder. For purposes
of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is for United States federal income
tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States;

    - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

    - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration
and one or more United States persons within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “United
States person”) have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in
place under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such trust as a United States person.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on a note generally will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for United
States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a U.S. Holder generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized on the disposition, except any
portion of such amount that is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as
described above under “—Stated Interest” to the extent not previously so taxed and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be the cost of the note to such holder.

Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss, if, at the time of such
disposition, the note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals and


-----

certain other non-corporate holders are, generally, subject to a reduced tax rate. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, a U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding at the applicable tax rate (currently at a rate of 24%)
with respect to cash payments of interest on the notes and the gross proceeds from dispositions (including a retirement
or redemption) of the notes, unless the holder provides the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-9
certifying that: (i) the social security or other taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) provided on that form is correct,
(ii) it is not subject to backup withholding because either (a) it is an entity that is exempt from backup withholding
(generally including corporations, tax-exempt organizations, and certain qualified nominees), (b) it has not been
notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding due to underreporting of interest or dividends with respect
to prior transactions, or (c) the IRS has notified it that it is no longer subject to backup withholding, and otherwise
complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. Holder who does not provide the
applicable withholding agent with its correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.

United States backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to
a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may
entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

The applicable withholding agent will report to the holders and the IRS the amount of any “reportable payments” and
any amounts withheld with respect to the notes as required by the Code and applicable Treasury regulations.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations for a non-U.S. Holder. For
purposes of this summary, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that for United States
federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.

**_Payment of Interest_**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA, interest paid on a note will be exempt from
United States federal withholding under the “portfolio interest exemption” and from United States federal income tax
provided that (i) the non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of stock possessing the
total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock, (ii) the non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign
corporation as described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code that is related to us, actually or constructively, through
the ownership rules under section 864(d)(4) of the Code, (iii) the non-U.S. Holder is not a bank (within the meaning
of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code), (iv) such payments of interest are not effectively connected with such non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and (v) the beneficial owner satisfies the requirements set
forth in section 871(h) or 881(c), as applicable, of the Code and the Treasury regulations issued thereunder by giving
the applicable withholding agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute or successor form or
such other form as the IRS may prescribe), as applicable, that has been properly completed and duly executed
establishing its status as a non-U.S. Holder.

If a non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the portfolio interest exemption described above, payments of
interest made to such holder generally will be subject to United States federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%,
unless the holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute or successor form as the IRS may prescribe), or other applicable IRS
Form W-8, establishing an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable tax
treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI certifying that interest paid or accrued on the notes is not subject to United States
federal withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
in the United States, in which case such interest will be taxed as described below under “—Income Effectively
Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business.”


-----

**_Income Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business_**

If the interest on the notes or any gain recognized on the disposition of a note is effectively connected with a United
States trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. Holder (“ECI”), then, unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise, the non-U.S. Holder will be required to pay United States federal income tax on that ECI on a net
income basis generally in the same manner as a U.S. Holder (and the 30% withholding tax described above will not
apply to any ECI that is interest, provided a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI is provided to the
applicable withholding agent). If a non-U.S. Holder is eligible for the benefits of any income tax treaty between the
United States and its country of residence, any ECI may be subject to United States federal income tax in the manner
specified by the treaty if the non-U.S. Holder claims the benefit of the treaty by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or a suitable substitute or successor form as the IRS may prescribe), or other applicable
IRS Form W-8, that has been properly completed and duly executed. In addition, a corporate non-U.S. Holder may
also, under certain circumstances, be subject to a “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or, if applicable, a lower treaty
rate, on its earnings and profits (subject to adjustments) that are effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder’s
conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note_**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), a non-U.S. Holder generally
will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the notes (other than any amount representing accrued but
unpaid interest on the notes, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Non-U.S. Holders—Payment of
Interest”) unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the
non-U.S. Holder, in which case, the non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed as described above, under
“—Income Effectively Connected with a U.S. Trade or Business,” or

    - in the case of a non-U.S. Holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the
United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year and certain other requirements are met.

If an individual non-U.S. Holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will be subject to
United States federal income tax at a rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on the amount by
which the gain recognized on the disposition from sources within the United States exceeds certain of such holder’s
capital losses allocable to sources within the United States, provided that the non-U.S. Holder timely files a United
States federal income tax return reporting such losses.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Amounts of interest paid to a non-U.S. Holder on a note, and amounts withheld from such payments, if any, generally
will be required to be reported to the IRS and to such holder. The IRS may make this information available under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder is
resident.

Backup withholding generally will not apply to payments of interest on the notes if a holder provides an IRS Form
W-8BEN or other applicable IRS Form W-8 certifying that such holder is not a United States person or otherwise
establishes an exemption.

The payment of the proceeds of the disposition of notes (including a retirement or redemption) to or through the United
States office of a United States or non-United States broker will be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate
of 24%) and related information reporting unless the non-U.S. Holder provides the certification described above or
otherwise establishes an exemption.

The proceeds of a disposition (including a retirement or redemption) effected outside the United States by a non-U.S.
Holder of the notes to or through a non-United States office of a broker generally will not be subject to backup


-----

withholding or related information reporting. However, if that broker is, for United States federal income tax purposes,
a United States person, a controlled foreign corporation, a non-United States person 50% or more of whose gross
income from all sources for certain periods is ECI, or a foreign partnership that, at any time during its tax year, is or
was engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States or that has one or more partners that are United
States persons who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the partnership, such
information reporting requirements will apply (but backup withholding generally will not apply) unless that broker
has documentary evidence in its files of such holder’s status as a non-U.S. Holder. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed
as a credit against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund, provided it
timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”),
may impose a United States federal withholding tax of 30% on interest income paid on the notes to (i) a foreign
financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution
enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the IRS substantial information
regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of
such institution, as well as certain account holders that are non-U.S. entities with United States owners) and to withhold
certain amounts, and (ii) a non-U.S. entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the applicable withholding agent with a certification
identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United States person who
directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. Although FATCA withholding would have also applied to
gross proceeds from a disposition of the notes, Treasury regulations proposed in December 2018 (which may currently
be relied upon) suspend withholding on such gross proceeds payments indefinitely.

An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the country in which the non-U.S. Holder is resident,
or future Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. In many cases, non-U.S. Holders
may be able to indicate their exemption from, or compliance with, FATCA by providing a properly completed revised
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) to the applicable withholding agent certifying
as to such status under FATCA; however, it is possible that additional information and diligence requirements will
apply in order for a holder to establish an exemption from withholding under FATCA to the applicable withholding
agent. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of FATCA with respect to their
investment in our notes.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the security and guarantees in certain of the_
_jurisdictions in which security and/or guarantees of the notes are being provided. It is a summary only, and_
_proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions_
_could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce_
_your rights and to collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees thereof._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in England and Wales, Denmark,_
_Luxembourg, the European Union, Germany, Italy and the United States. In the event that any one or more of the_
_Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to_
_predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced,_
_or the outcome of such proceedings._

**England and Wales**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of collateral of the notes (the “Collateral”) are incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales (the “English Obligors”). Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect
to the English Obligors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws.

It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Obligor could be opened in a different
jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In particular, while the UK was a member
state of the European Union (“EU”), insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable
UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the subsequent transition period
(the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020), EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the
end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant
amendments. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European member state, including for the purposes of
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings,
recast, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the
“EU Judgments Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Brexit Regulations”) and
The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019). The Insolvency Brexit Regulations
also effected key amendments to domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”),
the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Accordingly, the United
Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or
civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The
prospects of a European member state opening insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Obligor may vary
between member states; the implications of any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of
recognition in the United Kingdom, would need to be carefully considered in each case.

For instance, unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and
be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However,
to the extent that an English Obligor has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency
proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the
relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see “European Union” above). In
addition, certain foreign courts may assume jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of an English Obligor
which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic


-----

activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction or has a “sufficient connection” with
that jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in
England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any
company which has its COMI in the UK, or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark), or
which is incorporated in a member state of European Economic Area (“EEA Member State”). While this allows
English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the
efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such
proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring
proceedings” below).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may
be familiar. In the event that the English Obligors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States or other insolvency laws. English
insolvency laws and other limitations on the notes and the related guarantees may adversely affect the validity and
enforceability of the notes and the related guarantees against an English Obligor and may limit that amount that can
be recovered under the notes or the related guarantees.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such certain limitations.
The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees
and/or under the Collateral and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any of
the English Obligors (or any other obligor which may enter English law insolvency or restructuring proceedings).

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, as amended by the Insolvency Brexit Regulations, administration proceedings are available
in respect of any company incorporated in an EEA Member State, in addition to a company registered under the
Companies Act 2006 in England, Wales or Scotland and any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation)
with its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the United Kingdom or upon request from courts in
other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and territories.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that
(a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply
if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of the company’s property (see “—Qualifying
Floating Charge” below as to what constitutes a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property)) and
(b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay
its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a
“balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account
its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if,
among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within
21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “Qualifying Floating
Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out
of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply
according to the identity of the appointor.

The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively: rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if
neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily


-----

harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order
of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority of Claims on Insolvency”
below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it is not
reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result
for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless (s)he thinks either
the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of
the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Subject to this, the administrator must perform their functions
in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole.

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an
administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the
company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court (although a demand
for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or
permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress
and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary
factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration
described above.

Accordingly, if an obligor were to enter into administration, the notes, the guarantees and collateral granted by that
obligor, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent would
obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under
the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating
charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be
set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see
“Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a
fixed charge, provided _that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the_
administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the
fixed charge holder.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize
their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of
the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial
collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital
market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as
amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). Accordingly, if an obligor were to enter administration, it is
possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee
granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the
administrators. Contractual rights of set-off may also be available.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “Administration” above) or (in
limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative Receivership” below). The holder of a
qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an
administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative
receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity
or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into
administration.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which:
(a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act);
(b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder


-----

to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will
be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms
of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company
and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the
extent of the security granted relates to “the whole or substantially the whole” of the property of a company and there
is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party
will be able to appoint an administrator using the out of court process. That party will also be able to appoint an
administrative receiver if the qualifying floating charge falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act
(as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers, or if the
security document pre-dates 15 September 2003.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception
relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes
creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement
involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and generally includes
rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the
company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to
which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference
or an invalid floating charge (see “Transactions at an Undervalue”, “Preference” and “Avoidance of Floating Charges”
below). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the
company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges see “Administrative Receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge
in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to
statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any
receiver appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as
a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to
take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership
can run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver
to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration”
above).

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he
owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor). This
contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as
a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the
circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities
from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity
from the appointor).


-----

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the
proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by
the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “Priority of Claims
on Insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and
(b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s
members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’
voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over
the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company
is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “Administration” above).
Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution
of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors.
Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies
with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’
voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a
compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property
made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply
to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking
effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a
company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.
Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No
legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such
terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up
order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up

- it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation
of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead
and enforce their security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of
the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute
documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of Transactions”
below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 which permits a
company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or any class of them). The English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with
respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency
Act which, in the context of a non-English company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to
be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are
English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be
governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous


-----

cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient
connection in any given case.

Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending
on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are
given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors (although a creditor-led
scheme nonetheless requires the consent of the company or its insolvency officeholders). If a simple majority in
number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class
of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors,
including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The
scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which the court will review the fairness of
the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as
approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or decline to sanction the scheme.
In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the compromise of guarantees in order to ensure
its effectiveness.

The court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in
which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under
the governing law of the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert
evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned,
the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement,
which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of
arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger
a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring Plan Procedure_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) introduced a new “restructuring plan” procedure,
similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility of binding dissenting classes to the restructuring
plan.

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part 26A
of the Companies Act 2006 and is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act.

A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors,
shareholders, administrators or liquidators). The consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholders) is required
if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected stakeholders will vote
on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes
depending on their rights to be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights to be given under the
restructuring plan.

The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company need
only show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may
affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed
between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or
mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

For a class of stakeholders to approve the restructuring plan, at least 75% in value, of those present and voting, at the
meeting of that class, must vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving
stakeholders to constitute a majority in number of those present and voting. The restructuring plan may still be
sanctioned by the court even where certain classes do not vote in favor, provided the court is satisfied that:


-----

(a) no member of a dissenting class would be any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the
“relevant alternative” (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if
the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and

(b) at least one class who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event
of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan.

The restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether
the applicable statutory conditions have been met and consider whether to sanction the plan as a matter of its discretion.
The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds
all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance
with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies or,
where the company is an overseas company, publication of the court’s order in the Gazette.

As with schemes of arrangement, but unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan
does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings.

Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company
were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any
stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in
the subsequent insolvency proceedings.

**_Priority of Claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going-concern, one of
the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to
distribute the cash realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency
Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s
property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking
class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a
_pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class._

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only
respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency setoff regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their
mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation
of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security_ and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations
from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest respectively;

- _Second ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun, or a debtor company enters into administration, within_
12 weeks following the end of any Insolvency Act Part A1 stand-alone moratorium (see “Moratoriums” below),
moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts (however, as the moratorium is not available to companies
which are party to “capital market arrangements” where the debt incurred or expected to be incurred is at least
£10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue
of a capital market investment, details of such debts are omitted), as well as, if applicable, any prescribed fees or
expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company (which will take priority over
the moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts);


-----

- _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are_
statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid);

- _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done
in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of
insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts
rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include (a)
bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory
limit, and (b) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1, 2020, claims by HM Revenue
and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including Value-added tax, Pay As You Earn income tax
(including student loan repayments), employee National Insurance (“NI”) contributions and Construction
Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the
company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank
equally after the ordinary preferential debts;

- _Fifth ranking:_ holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets,
according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed
charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating
charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as
defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

- _Sixth ranking:_

  - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any remaining debt
due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any shortfall, the
insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled
to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured
creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

  - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate
in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the
commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted
into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the notes
or the related guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may, if there are sufficient realizations
from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

  - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid. This however
does not include “currency conversion” claims following the UK Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling
dated May 17, 2017; and

- _Seventh ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist,_
these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination
language in the relevant documentation.


-----

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency officeholder of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally
be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit
of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge
realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of
floating charge realizations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of
£800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed
Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors.
Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of
the relevant English Obligors’ assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the
time.

The requirement of the insolvency officeholder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any charge created or
otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security and/or
guarantees, or the entry by a company into a transaction, can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the
company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the relevant act. Therefore, if
during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an obligor, the administrator or liquidator
may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by
the company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an obligor’s insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the
notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating
charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order
is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which
the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas
in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company
with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an
administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an
undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow
director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife
or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner


-----

of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife
or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (a) the same person has control of both companies, (b) a person has
control of one and persons who are his or her associates, or (s)he and persons who are his or her associates, have
control of the other or (c) if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist
of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member
of either group as replaced by a person of whom (s)he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which
has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his or her directions or instructions, or (s)he
is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the
company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these
conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to any security
interest or guarantee include, without limitation, the following described below.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside
a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, (or give such other relief as the court thinks
fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security interest or
guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the
transaction, or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay
its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company
enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency
from the date of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made
a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly
less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith
and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was
a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it
would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the
guarantees or setting aside security interests or guarantees. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator
to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency
of the company in such proceedings. See “Connected Persons” above.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will
not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for
value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit
from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except
where the person was a party to the transaction.

**_Preference_**

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or give such other relief
as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such


-----

security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only be a preference if the company is unable to
pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of
the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person)
or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason
only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company gives the preference ending with the onset of
insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a
surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going
into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction
not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference,
the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not
entered into the transaction.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts
at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the
company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position
and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such influence. An order by the court for a
preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not (s)he is the person to
whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from
a person other than the company in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances, or prejudice
any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference
in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of
the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when (s)he
was a creditor of the company.

**_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_**

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, a transaction may be set aside by the court where it can be shown that a
transaction was at an undervalue, and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets
beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise
prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, and one or
more of the criteria set out in the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Act is satisfied. This provision may be used
by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (and is not therefore limited to liquidators or
administrators) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation
Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or
administration). There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must
be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent
at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as
it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect
the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the relevant notes or
setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person, whether or not (s)he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value
and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator
or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit transaction
is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were)
such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in


-----

respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is
presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an
administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The
court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years
before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That order may set aside, either in whole or
in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the
terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any
party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may
order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions
for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the
benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

**_Avoidance of Floating Charges_**

Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to
the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge created in favor of a connected
person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the
transaction, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services
supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the
creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The floating charge will not be invalid if,
at the time it was created, the company was solvent and did not become insolvent as a result; however, this exception
will not apply if the person in favor of whom it was created is connected.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating
charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically
invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. A liquidator or administrator can inform the relevant
floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid (or only partly valid as regards new consideration).
This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek to enforce the charge (which would then likely trigger an
application from the office holder for a court declaration that the charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as to its
validity.

If the floating charge constitutes a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations
then the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described above.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

The related guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain Collateral owned by the English
Obligors. Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security, namely:
(a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge
over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was
granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of);
(b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing
to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding-up or
administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash)
that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert
floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of
the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to
cover such costs and expenses in full (the same does not apply to fixed charge assets); (c) as mentioned above, until
the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of business; (d) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating
charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee
salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid pension contributions) where


-----

the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement and subject to the ring fencing of the Prescribed
Part for unsecured creditors; and (f) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a
floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same
priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. Only with prior
approval of the court can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the
property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the gross proceeds from
the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed
to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges, as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be
upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security interests will depend, among other
things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where
the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without
the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could
be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in
insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the
whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying
floating charge.” See also “Administrative Receivership.”

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property
of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other
onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to
prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors.
A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could
have made, or could make, a better bargain. The critical feature is that the performance of future obligations would
prejudice the liquidator’s obligation to realize the assets and make a distribution to creditors. However, this power to
disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract in so far as it has been performed, nor can it, except
so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any
other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be
a creditor of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English law,
equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an encumbrance
over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation
to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured
parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English
company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English Obligor, the banks
with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time to
exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with


-----

that English Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed)
charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to
exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the
floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of
certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally
notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights
unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or Collateral by the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action,
there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective
creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English
Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further,
corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into entering the
proposed transaction must be of corporate benefit for the English Obligors. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006
provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the
success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there
is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to have abused their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally
provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the
company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the UK Supreme
Court has held that the shift takes place when the company in question is “insolvent or bordering on insolvency” (or
an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable).

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not governed by
English law) granted by a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (together with prescribed
particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies for registration within
21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not
registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the
company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to
become immediately payable.

In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be
registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or by
any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it
considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely
accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will
have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the
Registrar of Companies. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England and Wales does not need
to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable
asset registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful
financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

**_Moratoriums_**

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or
optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute
or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides
the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration” above) or liquidation (see


-----

“Liquidation/winding-up” above), a standalone moratorium procedure is also available (under Part A1 of the
Insolvency Act). However, companies are ineligible for the standalone moratorium if (among other exclusions) the
company is party to an agreement which is or forms part of a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of
security or a guarantee) under which a party has incurred, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to
incur, a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement), where the
arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, among other things, secured and
unsecured debt that is rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper
issued to certain professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder must convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the company
went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor
considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the court finds that
the rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor enters liquidation or administration, holders of the relevant notes
may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Obligor enters into liquidation or
administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the relevant notes may become entitled. Any losses
resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Reliance on Ipso Facto Clauses Restricted_**

CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the Insolvency Act.
The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or services which permits the supplier to
terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g. impose amended terms), on the grounds that the
counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency procedure, will be void. A relevant insolvency procedure for
this purpose includes winding-up proceedings, administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary
arrangement, the standalone moratorium and the restructuring plan procedure, but not a scheme of arrangement.

Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant
insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency
proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner
consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause
the supplier hardship.

Certain exclusions apply, including for contracts involving financial services (which includes contracts for the
provision of financial services consisting of lending and contracts for the purchase or sale of a security).

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable
laws in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general
principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related laws is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model
Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it
was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain
British insolvency proceedings in other enacting states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant
debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in
another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency


-----

officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been
implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if
the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the
proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans
may be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the
enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague
Convention”) where applicable. As of January 15, 2024, the UK Government has signed the Hague Convention as of
July 2, 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “Hague
Convention 2019”), which will come into force 12 months after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings
commenced after that date. In addition, recognition may be available under principles of private international law and
(in the case of EU member states other than Denmark) Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit
from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between
the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency
procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies
involving the UK and one or more EU member states are subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

As a result, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in
EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than it was
during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend
on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open
parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a
UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that
such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to
fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states other
than Denmark.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states
may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU
or during the Transition Period. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be
recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

_Some of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of England and Wales. Future Guarantors may also be_
_organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Although we have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New_
_York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process_
_within the United States on directors and executive officers of such Guarantors. In addition, you may be unable to_
_enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of_
_the United States._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions_
_where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United_
_States is described below for the countries in which the Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own_
_advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the_
_United States._

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

A final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money issued by a federal or state court in the United
States may (subject to the conditions below) be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the party
against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts in accordance with
English rules on the conflict of laws. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England or Wales, proceedings
must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales. In such an action, the court would
not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below)
and it would generally be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good
defense to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce a U.S. judgment where:

- the U.S. judgment was procured by fraud;

- the U.S. judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the
defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate opportunity to be
heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural irregularities
under the laws of the court giving judgment;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

- the U.S. judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an English
court;

- the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a
contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to
the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties (which
involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980,
which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United Kingdom of any judgment given
by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed the compensatory
element of the judgment award; or


-----

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A (each, a “Rule 144A Note”). Notes also may be offered and sold to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one
or more global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”).
Regulation S Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in registered, global form without interest
coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”).

Investors who are qualified institutional buyers and who purchase notes in reliance on Rule 144A may hold their
interests in a Rule 144A Global Note directly through DTC if they are DTC participants, or indirectly through
organizations that are DTC participants. Investors who hold beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
hold such interests directly through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(“Clearstream”) if they are participants in these systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Note on behalf of
their participants through their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold the interests in the Regulation S Global
Note in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC.

Each Regulation S Global Note shall be deemed to be a “temporary global security” for purposes of Rule 904 under
Regulation S until the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering
(the “40 Day Period”). Prior to the end of the 40 Day Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
may only be held through Euroclear and Clearstream (as indirect participants in DTC). The ownership of interests in
the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof. Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC or persons
that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be
effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC and its participants.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC will credit on its book-entry registration
and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such a participant. The laws of
some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer
or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes
will not have the notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the notes in certificated form
and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” of notes under the indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominees) will be considered the holders of Global Notes for
all purposes under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. As such, participants must rely on the
procedures of DTC and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby.

Neither the Issuer, nor the Trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, nor any of the Issuer’s
or the Trustee’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive
definitive notes in registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following circumstances:


-----

    - if DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary or has ceased to
be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Act and, in either case, a successor depository is not
appointed by the Issuer within 90 days; or

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing to DTC following an event of
default under the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

In such an event, the registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with its
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of
Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to
Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC will distribute the amount received by it in
respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC,
if fewer than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit their respective participants’ accounts
by lot; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $2,000, as applicable, principal amount at maturity,
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest
and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer in dollars to the paying agent. The paying agent will, in turn, make
such payments to DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the
registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., DTC or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee or any of their respective agents
has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by DTC,
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in a “street name.”

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will
be paid to holders of interest in such notes through DTC in dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more


-----

participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, each
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right, subject to certain restrictions, to exchange the Global Notes for
Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately
available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell
the notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities,
such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in
accordance with the provisions of the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

During the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule
144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the indenture that will govern
the notes offered hereby) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40 Day Period, Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the Rule 144A Global Note without compliance
with these certification requirements.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note,
and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as set
forth in “Notice to Investors” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in
the form provided in the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest will be done by
DTC by means of an instruction originating from the DTC Participant through the DTC Deposit/ Withdrawal at
Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect
a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the
principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers
of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the date of initial
issuance of the notes.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience


-----

of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and
may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee or any of their agents are responsible
for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law;

    - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions
among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants,
eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, also have access to the DTC system and are
known as indirect participants.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are
financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain
banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate
in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that
interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through DTC will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and
any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries,
payments and other communications involving notes through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other
institutions are open for business in the United States.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility


-----

for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants, of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC accounts will follow
the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of DTC holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment
for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase
determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where
both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value
date.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and holding of the notes by (i)
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code or provisions under any non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are substantially similar
to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”), and (iii) entities and accounts
whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a
“Plan”).

**General**

ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code impose certain requirements on Plans subject to Title I of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Under
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
management or administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to acquire the notes should consult with its counsel regarding the
applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code
or other applicable Similar Law to such an investment and to confirm that such acquisition and holding will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of
ERISA, the Code or other applicable Similar Law. Furthermore, each Plan should consider the fact that none of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the initial purchasers, nor any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction
Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire or hold the notes
pursuant to this offering and is not undertaking to provide any advice or recommendation in a fiduciary capacity with
respect to such decision. The decision to acquire the notes must be made by each prospective Plan investor on an
arms’ length basis.

Non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), U.S. “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32)
of ERISA or Section 414(d) of the Code), and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section
414(e) of the Code), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any
such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the need for and the availability
of, if necessary, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the “plan assets” of an
ERISA Plan with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified
persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or
disqualified person that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any ERISA Plan
fiduciary that proposes to acquire and hold any notes with the assets of such ERISA Plan should consider, among
other things, whether such acquisition and holding may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
with a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to such ERISA Plan and, if so, whether exemptive relief
may be available for the transaction. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation,
the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates.

The U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide
exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition or holding of the notes.
These exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an independent
“qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to


-----

investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house
asset manager). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory
exemption for certain transactions involving certain non-fiduciary service providers or their affiliates. One of these
exemptions could provide an exemption for the acquisition and holding of the notes from the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code if its conditions are satisfied. However, there can be no assurance
that all of the conditions of any of these exemptions or of any other exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving the notes. Even if the conditions specified in one or more exemptions are met, the
scope of the relief provided by an exemption may not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited
transactions.

Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation that an investment in the notes would meet any or all of the
relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, or is appropriate for, a Plan.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be acquired, transferred to or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan, unless such acquisition, transfer and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, or a violation of any applicable Similar Law.

**Representation**

By acceptance of a note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have
represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or
hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the notes by
such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Law, and none of the Transaction
Parties is a fiduciary to such purchaser or transferee in connection with its investment in the notes pursuant to the
offering described in this offering memorandum.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. It is not intended to be a**
**complete discussion, nor is it to be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Due to the complexity of these**
**rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or**
**violation of Similar Law, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons acquiring notes on behalf**
**of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel and tax advisors regarding the potential**
**applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law to the acquisition or holding of the notes**
**and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any**
**other violation of any applicable requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law.**

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

RBC Capital Markets, LLC is acting as representative (the “representative”) of the several initial purchasers.
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, SMBC Nikko Securities America,
Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as joint bookrunners. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
a purchase agreement among us and the representative, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial
purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the notes offered hereby. The obligations of the
initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase notes from us, are several and
not joint. Those obligations are also subject to various conditions in the purchase agreement being satisfied. Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC will be acting solely as a joint bookrunner and not as an initial purchaser. As such, Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC will not be purchasing notes in this offering and will not receive any fees for acting in its capacity as a
joint bookrunner.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers and the joint bookrunners against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers and/or the joint
bookrunners may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The initial purchasers have advised us that they propose initially to offer the notes at the offering price set
forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any other term of
the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates or sell
notes to investment funds managed by affiliates of Bain Capital at a discount from the offering price set forth on the
cover of this offering memorandum.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The initial purchasers
propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable
state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The initial purchasers will not offer or
sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and
sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until
40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer
(whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the
dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and
agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify
any order to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason, to sell less than the entire principal amount of the
notes offered in this offering memorandum and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of notes
sought by such investor.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about     , 2024, which will be
the     business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as
“T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should
consult their own advisors.

**New Issue of Notes**


-----

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system. We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after
completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making
activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active
trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected.
If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest
rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic
conditions and other factors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum, without
first obtaining the prior written consent of RBC Capital Markets, LLC directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or
grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or establish an open “put equivalent position” within the meaning of Rule
16a-1 under the Exchange Act, or otherwise dispose of or transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any registration
statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any of our debt securities or any debt securities of any guarantor that
are substantially similar to the notes, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase
agreement.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to
purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open
market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward
pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase
in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchaser’s purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open
market.

Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude
of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor the
initial purchasers make any representation that the initial purchasers will engage in these transactions or that these
transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Notice To Prospective Investors in The European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer of notes in a Member State of the
EEA may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial purchasers to


-----

publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case in relation to such offer. Neither
the issuer nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for such
offer. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer
of the notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and section 86 of
the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. This offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

This offering memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved for the purposes of section
21 of the FSMA by, a person authorized under the FSMA. This offering memorandum is for distribution only to
persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being investment professionals falling
within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth
companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the UK or (iv) are
persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of
the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to
be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is
directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and
will be engaged in only with relevant persons. The notes are not being offered or sold to any person in the UK, except
in circumstances that will not result in an offer of securities to the public in the UK within the meaning of Part IV of
the FSMA.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

This offering memorandum is not intended to constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase or invest in the
notes. The notes may not be publicly offered, directly or indirectly, in Switzerland within the meaning of the Swiss
Financial Services Act (“FinSA”) and no application has or will be made to admit the notes to trading on any trading
venue (exchange or multilateral trading facility) in Switzerland. Neither this offering memorandum nor any other
offering or marketing material relating to the notes constitutes a prospectus pursuant to the FinSA, and neither this
offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the notes may be publicly distributed

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Singapore**

Each initial purchaser has acknowledged that this offering memorandum has not been registered as a
prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, each initial purchaser has represented and agreed
that it has not offered or sold any notes or caused the notes to be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or
purchase and will not offer or sell any notes or cause the notes to be made the subject of an invitation for subscription
or purchase, and has not circulated or distributed, nor will it circulate or distribute, this offering memorandum or any
other document or material in connection with the offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the notes,
whether directly or indirectly, to any person in Singapore other than:

(a) to an institutional investor (as defined in Section 4A of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289)
of Singapore, as modified or amended from time to time (the “SFA”)) pursuant to Section 274 of the SFA;

(b) to a relevant person (as defined in Section 275(2) of the SFA) pursuant to Section 275(1) of the SFA
and in accordance with the conditions specified in Section 275 of the SFA; or

(c) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provision of

Where the notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person which is:

(a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)) the sole
business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals,
each of whom is an accredited investor; or

(b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments
and each beneficiary of the trust is an individual who is an accredited investor,

securities or securities-based derivatives contracts (each term as defined in Section 2(1) of the SFA) of that corporation
or the beneficiaries’ rights and interest (howsoever described) in that trust shall not be transferred within six months
after that corporation or that trust has acquired the notes pursuant to an offer made under Section 275 of the SFA

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners and their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the
future engage in, investment banking, commercial banking, financial advisory and other commercial dealings in the
ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees
and commissions for these transactions. The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have made commitments
to us with respect to the increased commitments under the Extended First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, the
Incremental Senior Secured Credit Facilities and a senior secured bridge facility, in each case, to finance a portion of
the Transactions or for general corporate purposes, and will receive customary fees in connection with such
commitments. The proceeds of the notes, together with a portion of the Incremental First Lien Term Loan Facilities,
will reduce the bridge commitments in full.


-----

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners
and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own respective
account and for the accounts of their respective customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners or their respective
affiliates have a lending relationship with us, the initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners or their respective affiliates
routinely hedge, and the initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners or their respective affiliates may hedge, their credit
exposure to us consistent with their respective customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers,
the joint bookrunners and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers, the joint bookrunners and their respective affiliates
may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions
in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments
of ours or our affiliates.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any jurisdiction and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons (as such terms are defined under the Securities Act), except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered hereby only (1) to “qualified institutional

requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A and (2) outside of the United States in reliance upon
Regulation S under the Securities Act, to non-U.S. persons who will be required to make certain representations to us

to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. The purchaser

the notes in accordance with Regulation S.

2. The purchaser understands that the notes are being offered in transactions not involving any public offering

qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144, or outside the United States to a non-U.S. person in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 904 under the Securities Act, or in accordance with
another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based upon an
opinion of counsel, if we so request), (ii) to us or (iii) pursuant to an effective registration statement
and, in each case, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States
or any other applicable jurisdiction, and

(ii) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser from
it of the resale restrictions set forth in (a) above.

3. The purchaser confirms that

capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the notes and that such purchaser and any
accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risks of its or their investment,

(ii) such purchaser is not acquiring the notes with a view towards any distribution thereof in a
transaction that would violate the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United
States or any other applicable jurisdiction; provided that the disposition of its property and the
property of any accounts for which such purchaser is acting as fiduciary will remain at all times
within its control, and

(iii) such purchaser has received a copy of this offering memorandum and acknowledges that such
purchaser has had access to such financial and other information and has been afforded an
opportunity to ask such questions of our representative and receive answers thereto as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase the notes.

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Management and Board of Directors of Rocket Software, Inc.

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Rocket Software, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2023 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

**_Emphasis of Matter_**

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for leases in 2022. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this
matter.

**_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the consolidated
financial statements are available to be issued.

**_Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the


-----

override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial
likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:

  - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the
audit.

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

  - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

**_Other Information_**

Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other
information, which is not presented herein, comprises management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about
market risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, client relationship with IBM, and
inflation, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors' report
thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other
information and the consolidated financial statements or the other information otherwise appears
to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected
material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

**Rocket Software, Inc.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1.** **Nature of Business**

Rocket Software, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) builds and services enterprise software products and
solutions that help corporations, government agencies and other organizations operate, optimize and modernize their
mission-critical IT infrastructure. The Company’s strategy is to lead in its existing product markets by: (a) growing
the installed base of its software through the license of its products to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)
partners, independent software vendor (“ISV”) partners, reseller partners and enterprise customers through branded
direct sales; (b) retaining the loyalty of those customers by providing solutions, features, and flexibility through its
service and support businesses; and (c) expand its market share by acquiring and integrating businesses with similar
technology, customers, platforms, and sales channels. The Company has its primary operations in the United States,
Europe, Australia, China, India and Japan.

The Company is subject to risks common to growing technology-based companies, including dependence on key
personnel, rapid technological change, competition from substitute products and larger companies, dependence upon
relationships with OEMs and ISVs and the need for continued market acceptance of the Company’s products and
services.

**2.** **Basis of Presentation, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting**
**Pronouncements**

**Principles of Consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**Use of Estimates**
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant items with reported amounts based on estimates including, but not limited to
revenue, accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable, goodwill and intangible assets, right-of-use assets and
lease obligations, purchase price allocations, contingent liabilities, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, derivative
assets and liabilities, other liabilities and deferred income taxes.

**Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash**
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash includes security deposits to the lessors of certain office locations in
the form of certificates of deposit with a bank. The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

**Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses**
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.
Management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be
uncollectible. The Company reserves for receivables that are determined to be uncollectible, if any, in its allowance
for credit losses. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of customers, historical experience, the age of
the receivable and current market and economic conditions. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
receivable is written off against the allowance.

The following is a roll-forward of the Company’s allowance for credit losses (in thousands):

**Expense**

**Balance**

**(Income) to** **Balance at**

**Beginning of** **Deductions (1)**

**Statement of** **End of Period**

Year ended December 31, 2022 2,493 (431) (1,154) 908
Year ended December 31, 2021 521 956 1,016 2,493

(1) Deductions include actual accounts written-off, net of recoveries.

**Acquisitions**
The Company accounts for business acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination using the
acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at
their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration transferred in a business
combination, including any contingent consideration, is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business combination are
accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
relative fair values without recognizing goodwill. Significant judgments are used in determining fair values of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value and intangible asset useful life determinations are based on, among other
factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty cost savings, and appropriate
discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in
allocating the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Company’s current and future
operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates which may result in adjustments to goodwill and
acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of
asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after
the end of the measurement period are recorded within the Company’s operating results.

**Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets**
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible
and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets consist of technology, customer relationships, trademarks and
tradenames, and backlog. Other long-lived assets generally consist of property and equipment.


-----

The Company’s intangible assets, other than backlog and those intangible assets classified as indefinite-lived, as
well as the Company’s property and equipment, are depreciated or amortized to expense over their estimated useful
lives, or lease term, on a pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or on a straight-line basis. Intangible
assets that are amortized to expense have estimated useful lives that range from eight to twenty-one years. Backlog
is amortized, as a reduction of revenue, on a specific identification basis following the recognition of the revenue of
the underlying contracts. Amortization of intangible assets charged to cost of revenue and operating expense for the
years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $207.0 million, $206.9 million and $169.2 million,
respectively. Backlog amortization expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was $6.2 million, $9.1 million and
$7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are
indicators of impairment. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, or more
frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. In assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the
carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may
impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These
judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors,
overall financial performance, events which are specific to the Company, and trends in the fair value of the
Company’s common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or
negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company, whose management
uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance, has
determined that it has one reporting unit.

The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 on the single
reporting unit and concluded that goodwill had not been impaired.

Similar to the evaluation of those long-lived assets that are not amortized, the Company evaluates amortizable
intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the
assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment
loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets plus net proceeds
expected from disposition of the assets, if any, are less than the carrying value of the assets. If an asset or asset group
is deemed to be impaired, the amount of the impairment loss, if any, represents the excess of the asset or asset
group’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value. Each period, the Company also evaluates the estimated
remaining useful life of its long-lived intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization.

A considerable amount of judgment is required in performing an impairment analysis, principally in determining
discount rates, and financial forecasts. Unanticipated changes in market conditions could have a material impact on
the Company’s projected cash flows. Differences in actual cash flows as compared to the projected cash flows, as
well as changes in market conditions, could require the Company to record additional impairment losses in the
future.

**ASC 606 Revenue Recognition**
The guidance provides that if an arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, each distinct performance
obligation is accounted for separately. Revenue is subsequently recognized through the application of the following
steps: (i) identification of the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the
contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to performance
obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The
Company’s policy does not allow for a right of return.


-----

**_Non-OEM Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Accounts Receivable, and Deferred Revenue_**
The Company’s software licenses are primarily on-premise and fully functional when made available to the
customer. As the customer can use and benefit from the license on its own, on-premise software licenses represent
distinct performance obligations. Revenue for software licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when a
license key is delivered to a customer, and the customer may use and benefit from the license. These licenses are
sold as perpetual or for a fixed term.

Perpetual licenses are generally invoiced upon execution of the contract Term licenses are generally invoiced
upfront or on an annual basis over the term of the arrangement, which generally range from one to five years. Any
difference between the license revenue recognized and the amount invoiced to the customer is accounted for on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as unbilled accounts receivable.

The Company’s maintenance service consists of technical support, bug fixes, and when-and-if available unspecified
software upgrades. As these maintenance services are considered to be a series of distinct services that are
substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress, the Company concludes that they
represent one combined performance obligation. Maintenance revenue is therefore recognized ratably over the
contract period. Any difference between the maintenance amount invoiced or collected and the maintenance revenue
recognized is accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue.

Professional services primarily include consulting and training services. In general, services are distinct performance
obligations. Services revenue is generally recognized as the services are delivered to the customer. The Company
applies the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing for time and materials-based arrangements as
the invoiced amount corresponds to the value of the services provided.

The Company also sells several Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) hosted offerings. These SaaS hosted offerings are
sold via a subscription-based model. Customers can use hosted software over the contract period without taking
possession of it and the services are available to them throughout the entire term, even if they do not use the service.
As the services related to this model are indistinct from one another and have the same duration and measure of
progress, revenue related to these offerings is recognized ratably over the contract period. SaaS arrangements are
generally invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the arrangement.

As part of the review over the transaction price, the Company considers whether there are any variable fees, such as
usage-based arrangements, or price concessions that may give rise to variable consideration. Revenue related to
variable consideration is recorded at the time of the transfer of licenses or services to its customers.

Significant judgment is required in estimating standalone selling prices. The Company utilizes observable inputs
when they exist, such as for maintenance renewals on historical perpetual license sales, and for SaaS hosted
arrangements. The standalone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically the standalone selling
prices for software licenses, are highly variable. In these instances, the Company estimates a narrow range of
standalone selling prices using observable pricing information, such as the Company’s existing price list and
historical sales data.

When bundled term license and maintenance sales occur, the Company bifurcates the transaction into its two
separate performance obligations, and then allocates the transaction value accordingly. The Company’s allocation
between the term license and maintenance performance obligations is calculated based upon the observable
relationship of the selling price of a standalone maintenance renewal to the related perpetual license fee, which is
generally 20% of the net license fee for one year of maintenance. The Company considers using the observable
relationship between a perpetual license fee and a standalone maintenance renewal to be appropriate for allocating
value within a bundled arrangement because the nature of the respective performance obligations and the rights
transferred to the customer are similar.

As part of the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations, the Company considers the
presence of any material rights or specified future upgrades that could represent additional performance obligations.


-----

The Company did not identify any material right performance obligations in the periods presented.

**_OEM Revenue Recognition_**
Consistent with ASC 606, the Company recognizes royalty revenue to which it is entitled in the period in which it is
earned. The Company utilizes customer information and other sources of information to determine the most likely
estimate of royalty revenue to be recognized and accrued each period. As a management estimate, the determination
of sales based royalty revenue requires significant judgment. In the event of any material difference between the
estimate and the actual royalty received, the Company will record an adjustment in the period the revenue was
earned.

**Deferred Commissions**
The Company’s incremental costs of obtaining a contract which consist of sales commissions, are deferred, and
amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period, generally the expected life of the customer
relationship. The expected customer relationship period is determined based on average historical customer
relationship periods, including expected renewals. Expected renewal periods are only included in the expected
customer relationship period if commission amounts paid upon renewal are not commensurate with amounts paid on
the initial contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the Company incurs to obtain a
contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company groups similar contracts
based on revenue and customer type and amortizes on a systemic basis over the average contract length or expected
customer life.

**Qualitative Risks to Revenue Recognition**
Because a portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the U.S., there exists the risk of exposure to
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. International sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies,
and changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect revenue results.
However, as most of the Company’s revenue comes from North American entities that operate in USD, this is not
deemed to be a significant risk.

The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign
governments and agencies. These customers operate based upon allocated budgets and appropriations. In the event
that a government or agency enters into a multi-year contract and does not receive its expected allocated budget, it is
possible that the existing contract could be terminated. However, the Company’s standard practice is for any multiyear contract to contain a substantive termination penalty, which provides evidence of enforceable rights and
obligations throughout the stated contract term. Therefore, this is not seen to be a significant risk to revenue
recognition.

**Income Taxes**
Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and for tax net operating loss and credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided for the
amount of deferred tax assets that, based on currently available evidence, may not be realized.

Under the guidance in ASC 740 for uncertain tax positions, the Company records a liability associated with an
uncertain tax position if the Company determines that there is not a more likely than not possibility of sustaining
such benefit upon audit by the taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. The Company records a
tax benefit of a position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement.

**Research and Development and External Capitalized Software Development Costs**
In accordance with ASC 730, the Company expenses costs associated with the development of computer software
for external use as incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility. The Company has determined that
technological feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been
resolved through coding and testing. Costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and


-----

prior to the general release of the products are capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
software costs that were eligible for capitalization have been immaterial, and as a result, no costs have been
capitalized.

**Capitalized Internal-Use Software**
The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, “Internal-Use
Software.” The Company capitalizes costs for software to be used internally when entering the application
development stage. This occurs when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and
commits to funding the project, and it is feasible that the project will be completed, and the software will perform
the intended function. The Company ceases to capitalize costs related to a software project when it enters the postimplementation and operation stage. If different determinations are made with respect to the state of development of
a software project, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ
materially.

Costs capitalized during the application development stage consist of payroll and related costs for employees who
are directly associated with, and who devote time directly to, a project to develop software for internal use. The
Company also capitalizes the direct costs of materials and services, which generally includes outside contractors,
and interest. The Company does not capitalize any general and administrative or overhead costs or costs incurred
during the application development stage related to training or data conversion costs. Costs related to upgrades and
enhancements to internal-use software, if those upgrades and enhancements result in additional functionality, are
capitalized. If upgrades and enhancements do not result in additional functionality, those costs are expensed as
incurred. If different determinations are made with respect to whether upgrades or enhancements to software
projects would result in additional functionality, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for
that project could differ materially.

The Company amortizes capitalized costs with respect to development projects for internal-use software when the
software is ready for use. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized using the straight-line
method over a 3-year period. In determining and reassessing the estimated useful life over which the cost incurred
for the software should be amortized, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition
and other economic factors.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 capitalized software development costs were $7.0 million and $7.9 million,
respectively. Additions relating to capitalized software development costs incurred during the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $0.6 million, $5.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

**Asset Retirement Obligations**
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC Topic 410, “Asset Retirement and
Environmental Obligations” (Topic 410), which applies to certain obligations associated with “leasehold
improvements” within leased office facilities. Topic 410 requires that a liability be initially recognized for the
estimated fair value of the obligation when it is incurred. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the
associated liability is accreted to the estimated fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic
accretion charges which are generally recorded within "General and administrative" expense in Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. When the obligation is settled, any difference between the
final cost and the recorded amount is recognized as income or loss on settlement in Consolidated Statements of
Income.

**Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Accounting**
Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their functional
currency. Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these
transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gain (loss) reflected in
“Other income (expenses), net” for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $(25.1) million, $11.6


-----

million and $9.9 million, respectively.

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.
dollars at current exchange rates, while revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during
each reporting period. The resulting currency translation gain (loss) are included in "Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**Comprehensive Income (Loss)**
Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from nonowner sources. Comprehensive income (loss) consists of the net income (loss), foreign
currency translation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net, and is reported within the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

**Other Income (Expense)**
Other income (expense) includes interest income, gains and losses on long-lived asset disposals, gains and losses on
derivative instruments not designated for hedging, gains on investments, losses on early retirement of debt, and
realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses.

**December 31,**

**2023** **2022** **2021**

Realized and unrealized foreign currency gain (loss) $      (25,122) $      11,596 $      17,994
Realized and unrealized gain on derivatives 7,198 44,701 8,285
Other income (expense) 20,629 698 (2,213)
Other income (expense), net 2,705 56,995 24,066

**Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted**
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, enhancing income
tax disclosure requirements by requiring specified categories and greater disaggregation within the rate
reconciliation table, disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and providing clarification on uncertain tax
positions and related financial statement impacts. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1,
2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the standard on
its consolidated financial statements.

**Recently adopted accounting pronouncements**
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform” under ASC _848, intended to provide_
temporary optional expedients and exceptions to U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge
accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This guidance
was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and the Company may apply the amendments prospectively to contract
modifications made or relationships entered into or evaluated through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December
31, 2024. The Company adopted this ASU in 2023, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13"), which requires
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including
accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward looking expected loss model,
rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded
through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the
concept of "other-than-temporary" impairments. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing


-----

arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for
Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 201811, Targeted Improvements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to
recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of
expense recognition in the income statement.

The Company adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2022 using the required modified retrospective approach and
utilizing the effective date as its date of initial application. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with
the previous guidance in ASC 840. ASC 842 provides several optional practical expedients in transition. The
Company applied the package of practical expedients to leases that commenced prior to the effective date whereby
the following are not required to be reassessed: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases;
(ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) the treatment of initial direct costs for existing
leases. The Company elected the short-term lease expedient for all leases that qualified based on a lease term of 12
months or less, and consequently a right-of-use asset or lease liability was not recognized for short term leases.

Upon its adoption of ASC 842, the Company recorded lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets
based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The incremental borrowing rate (IBR)
at January 1, 2022 was used to calculate the present value of the Company’s lease portfolio as of that date. The
adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of $29 million and right-of-use assets
of $26 million on the Company’s balance sheet as of January 1, 2022, as well as a corresponding deferred tax asset
and deferred tax liability of $7 million and $6 million, respectively. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s statements of operations and comprehensive loss or statements of cash flows.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12 (“ASU 2019-12”), Simplifying the Accounting for Income
Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. For non-public entities, this guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and for interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2022, with
no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

On October 28, 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for
_Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires_
an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure deferred revenue from acquired contracts using the
revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, rather than the prior requirement to
record deferred revenue at fair value. Generally, this new guidance will result in the acquirer recognizing contract
assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts recorded by the acquiree. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, an entity that
elects to early adopt in an interim period should apply the amendments to all business combinations that occurred
during the fiscal year that includes that interim period. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company elected to
early adopt ASU 2021-08 on a retrospective basis, effective on January 1, 2021.

The adoption of ASU 2021-08 effective as of January 1, 2021 had the following impact on the Company’s results
for the year ended December 31, 2021:

**Impact of Adoption of**
**ASU 2021-08**
Total revenues $             44,169
Operating income 44,169
Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 44,169
Provision (benefit) from income taxes 10,758
Net income (loss) $             33,411

The adoption of ASU 2021-08 also resulted in an increase of goodwill by $53.0 million attributable to the revised


-----

measurement of deferred revenue and deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisitions of Uniface B.V and ASG
Everglades Holdings, Inc. in 2021. The acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from Zumasys, Inc. on October 1,
2021 was accounted for post-adoption and as such, no revision for that acquisition was required.

**Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements**
During the preparation of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified certain errors in the
previously issued 2022 and 2021 consolidated financial statements related to the accounting for the fair value of
hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the calculation of the interest expense deduction
within the tax provision.

With respect to hedge accounting, the Company did not appropriately record the deferred tax impact of the fair value
of the hedges that were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. With respect to the other error, the
Company did not appropriately reflect certain items in the calculation of the annual limitation of the interest expense
deduction. These errors resulted in an overstatement of income taxes receivable of $3.9 million, an understatement
of income taxes payable of $1.3 million, an understatement of deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 million and an
overstatement of accumulated other comprehensive income of $18.8 million as of December 31, 2022. These errors
also resulted in an overstatement of income taxes receivable of $2.9 million, an overstatement of deferred tax
liabilities of $9.7 million and an understatement of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $6.8 million
as of December 31, 2021. These errors also resulted in an understatement of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) of $17.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

In the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss), the errors also resulted in an
overstatement of $25.6 million to each of the unrealized (loss) gain on derivative contracts, net, other comprehensive
(loss) income and comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2022, and an overstatement of
$10.5 million to each of the unrealized (loss) gain on derivative contracts, net, other comprehensive (loss) income
and comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2021. These errors did not have any impact on
the previously reported net loss for both periods.

In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the errors resulted in an understatement of deferred income taxes of
$2.3 million, an overstatement of the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1.0 million and an
understatement of the change in income taxes payable of $1.3 million within cash flows from operating activities for
the year ended December 31, 2022. The errors also resulted in an understatement of deferred income taxes of $2.9
million and an understatement of the change in income taxes payable of $2.9 million within cash flows from
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no impact on the previously reported net cash
flows from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities for both periods.

After giving consideration to these errors, the Company has concluded that they were not material to any previously
issued consolidated financial statements. The 2022 and 2021 consolidated financial statements and the related
footnotes have been revised to correct for these errors.

**3.** **Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

perpetual and term-based licenses, subscription revenue from royalty arrangements, SaaS subscription revenue, and
professional service revenue, are recognized over time.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $7.4 million increase to revenue to correct immaterial
errors related to items which should have been recorded in 2021.

**4.** **Acquisitions**

**_AMC Business_**

On November 28, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Open Text
Corporation (“OpenText”), pursuant to which OpenText has agreed to divest, directly and indirectly through certain
subsidiaries, its Application Modernization and Connectivity business (the “AMC Business”) and the Company has
agreed to purchase the same and generally assume certain liabilities related to the AMC Business, as set forth in the
Agreement, for an all-cash purchase price of $2.275 billion, before taxes, fees and other adjustments (such

**_ASG_**

On May 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Rocket Software, Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiary, Avengers Merger
Sub, Inc. acquired 100% interests in ASG Everglades Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, ASG
Technologies Holdings, Inc., ASG Technologies Group, Inc. (collectively, “ASG” or the “Acquiree”) for a total
purchase price of $828.0 million, net of cash acquired of $28.4 million. The Company paid $856.4 million in cash at
the time of the closing. This acquisition expands the ability of Rocket to develop and modernize mission-critical
enterprise applications that deliver legendary business outcomes and solutions to customers.

In accordance with the FASB’s ASC 805 Business Combinations, Rocket was determined to be the accounting
acquirer. As such, Rocket applied the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and
liabilities of ASG, which have been measured at estimated fair value as of the date of the business combination.

ASG’s assets and liabilities were measured at estimated fair values primarily using Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair
value represent management’s best estimate of assumptions about future events and uncertainties, including significant
judgements related to future cash flows, discount rates, competitive trends, margin and revenue growth assumptions
including royalty rates and customer attrition rates, market comparables and others. Inputs used were generally
obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates.

Since the Closing Date, the Company has made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in
existence as of the Closing Date. These adjustments primarily included an adjustment to conform ASG’s revenue
recognition policy of allocating contract consideration to performance obligations to Rocket’s policy, and an
adjustment to write off an IPR&D intangible asset that was initially measured. The table below incorporates the
impact of the measurement period adjustments to date as well as the effect on the adoption of ASU 2021-08.

The following table summarizes the allocation of purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed by
Rocket with the excess of purchase price over the fair value of ASG’s net assets recorded as goodwill.

of the indirect shares relating to the equity swap and together with the direct shares, sold 100% of its stake in
Software AG to Mosel Bidco SE, resulting in net proceeds of $258.6 million and a gain of $15.7 million. The gain
consisted of a $6.5 million gain on the sale of the direct shares, net of commissions of $0.1 million, and a $9.2
million gain on the settlement of the equity swap. The collateral of $67.3 million relating to the equity swap was
also returned in the second quarter of 2023. A portion of the proceeds were used to pay down in full the outstanding

assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

On January 1, 2022, certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) became effective with
significant impact to the Company. Adjusted taxable income (“ATI”), on which a 30% interest expense limitation is
based is no longer adjusted for depreciation, amortization and depletion, resulting in lower ATI and greater interest
expense disallowance. Additionally, research and experimental expenditures (“R&E”) are no longer immediately


-----

deductible for tax purposes in the year incurred, and instead, must be capitalized and amortized over a period of 5
years (for research conducted within the U.S.) or 15 years (for research conducted in foreign jurisdictions).

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has approximately $5.4 million of U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards, $305.6 million of U.S. federal interest expense carryforward, $6.2 million of U.S. state net operating
loss carryforwards and $9.1 million of U.S. state tax credit carryforwards. The U.S. federal interest expense
carryforward and certain of the U.S. state credit carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining
carryforwards expire at various points through 2040, if not utilized. The Company also has net operating losses in
the United Kingdom of $5.2 million, in Germany of $20.3 million, in Brazil of $2.6 million and in Singapore of $2.7
million which can all be carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, the Company has a minimum alternate tax
(“MAT”) credit in India in the amount of $0.9 million which can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances against the portions of the U.S. interest expense carryforwards,
U.S. state tax credit carryforwards, and United Kingdom net operating losses that more likely than not will not be
utilized. The United Kingdom net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain acquisition-related utilization
limitations, which provide uncertainty with respect to their future realization. The total valuation allowance
increased by $17.0 million during 2023, primarily related to the U.S. interest expense carryforwards and the increase
in U.S. states tax credit carryforwards.

The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings of its subsidiaries in Australia and Switzerland and has
specific and measurable plans to reinvest those earnings. The Company has determined that the deferred tax liability
on the future repatriation of $7.7 million of unremitted earnings in Switzerland that are indefinitely reinvested is not
material as of December 31, 2023.

Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is
more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on an
annual basis, based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the
recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, of $22.8 million, $25.6 million
and $19.7 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year decrease relates
primarily to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the
increase associated with the uncertainty related to the sourcing of certain revenue for state tax purposes. The amount
of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Company’s effective tax rate is
$13.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The following is a tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances
of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):


-----

The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income
taxes. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 total accrued interest and penalties were $1.9 million, $1.7 million
and $1.4 million, respectively. To the extent that tax attributes would be available to offset any tax associated with
uncertain tax positions upon assessment by a taxing authority, the liabilities for such uncertain tax positions are
recorded as reductions of the deferred tax assets for such attributes. Otherwise, the liabilities for uncertain tax
positions, including interest and penalties, are included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various U.S. state and foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state, or foreign
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. However, carryforward attributes from prior years may still
be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if they are used in an open year.

Although the Company believes its tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax examinations could
result in favorable or unfavorable changes in its estimates. The Company anticipates the expiration of certain
statutes of limitations during 2024 that could result in a decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits between $6.5
million and $7.5 million.

**_2018 Lien Agreements_**

In 2018, the Company entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that was comprised of (i) a first lien
term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $1,300.0 million (the “First Lien Term Loan”), (ii) the conversion of
$825.0 million in borrowings under the First Lien Term Loan into borrowings of $470.0 million (the “Dollar Term
Loan”) and 300.0 million Euro (the “Euro Term Loan”) via a syndicate of lenders, each with a maturity date of
November 2025.

On October 5, 2023, the Company amended its credit agreements to extend the maturity date of its First Lien debt
from November 2025 to November 2028, decrease the combined USD term loan under the First Lien Term Loan
and the Dollar Term Loan to an aggregate principal of approximately $1,407.5 million (the “New Dollar Term
Loan), and increase the Euro term loan from €300.0 to €575.0 million (the “New Euro Term Loan” and, together
with the New Dollar Term Loan, the “Existing First Lien Term Loan”). The Company paid $30.1 million of original
issue discount which was recorded net within Long-term debt and is being amortized over the term of the agreement
to interest expense. The Company paid $10.0 million of third-party fees, of which $0.8 million, related to new
lenders in the syndication, were recorded net within Long-term debt and are being amortized over the term of the
agreement to interest expense and $9.2 million, related to existing lenders in the syndication, were expensed and
recorded within general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company expensed
$2.6 million for loss of extinguishment of debt related to lenders exiting the syndication and recorded within other
(expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Under the terms of the New Dollar Term Loan, the principal amount is paid in quarterly installments equal to 1.0%
of the original principal amount per annum until the final maturity date, and monthly floating interest rate payments
are made based on the one-month Term SOFR rate, plus a margin of 4.75%. Under the terms of the New Euro Term
Loan, the Company will make monthly floating interest rate payments based on the one-month EURIBOR rate (with
a minimum of 0.00%) plus a margin of 4.75%. The Company has an option to adjust the Term SOFR and
EURIBOR interest periods from the one-month rate to another period under the agreement. The remaining principal
payment, after installment payments, is due upon maturity.

The First Lien includes a revolving loan facility (“Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility”) of up to $152.9
million with an interest rate, at the Company’s election, the adjusted SOFR rate plus 3.25% or the alternative base
rate plus 2.25%, with step-downs to, (i) the adjusted SOFR rate plus 3.125% or the alternative base rate plus
2.125%, as applicable, and (ii) the adjusted SOFR rate plus 3.00% or the alternative base rate plus 2.00%, as
applicable, in each case based on achieving certain First Lien Net Leverage Ratios, as defined in the credit


-----

agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loan and the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. The
maturity date of the First Lien Revolver is November 28, 2026.

Net availability under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility totaled $151.7 million at December 31, 2023
after giving effect to $1.2 million of letters of credit issued thereunder.

The credit agreement governing the Existing First Lien Term Loan contains a financial covenant which requires a
maximum Net Leverage Ratio of 7.70 to 1.00 if, on the last day of any quarter, the amount of borrowing under the
Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 35% of the total revolving commitment. As of
December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the New Credit Facility.

**_2019 RSD Debt_**

As of August 16, 2019, the Company assumed a new debt (“RSD Debt”) in connection with the 2019 acquisition of
Sixon Holding SA. Per the RSD credit facilities agreement dated September 19, 2018, RSD Debt consists of facility
A, a CHF 17.5 million senior amortizing term loan facility and facility B, a CHF 17.5 million senior non-amortizing
term loan facility. The debt has multiple maturity dates through 2024. The amortizing term loan facility is subject to
mandatory repayments of CHF 3.2 million, payable annually on December 31st through 2022, with a final payment
of CHF 3.2 million due on March 28, 2024. The non-amortizing term loan facility has a maturity date of September
28, 2024.

**_2021 Senior Notes_**

On February 2, 2021, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Uniface (“Uniface”), the Company issued
$575.0 million of 6.5% senior notes (the “Senior Notes”).

The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, (i) to finance
and consummate the Uniface acquisition, (ii) to repay in full the outstanding indebtedness and accrued interest under
the Second Lien, (iii) to pay down all outstanding borrowings under the First Lien Revolver (without reducing any
commitments thereunder), (iv) to pay transaction expenses and fees in connection with each of the foregoing and (v)
to the extent of any remaining proceeds, for other general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions
and strategic investment opportunities.

The Senior Notes are unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 6.5% per year, and interest on the notes accrue from
February 2, 2021 and will be payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on February 15 and August 15 of each year,
commencing August 15, 2021. The Senior Notes have a maturity date of February 15, 2029.

Contractual maturities of the Company’s debt obligations as of December 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

2024 $      33,770

**11.** **Leases**

The Company is party to various leases for property, office space, equipment, and automobiles. The Company
determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception or upon modification of a contract and classifies each
lease as either an operating or finance lease. The Company only reassesses lease classification subsequent to the
commencement date if the contract is modified. Finance and operating lease assets represent the Company’s right to
use an underlying asset as lessee for the lease term, and lease obligations represent the Company’s obligation to


-----

make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and obligations are recognized at the lease commencement
date based on the present value of lease payments, net of incentives, over the lease term. Generally, the Company's
lease contracts do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate and, therefore, the Company uses its estimated
incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The lease asset also reflects any lease payments made, initial direct costs incurred, and lease incentives received
prior to commencement date. The Company’s lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the
lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised.

Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease
assets and liabilities. These variable payments include insurance, taxes, payments tied to a consumer price index or
other such indices, and payments for maintenance and utilities. For all leases, the Company does not separate lease
components and non-lease components. Leases with an initial expected term of 12 months or less are not recorded in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were the following
amounts related to operating and finance lease assets and liabilities (in thousands):

**December 31,** **December 31,**

**12.** **Stockholders’ Equity**

**Common Stock**

The total number of shares of stock which the Company has authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock,
with a par value of $0.01 per share. All 1,000 shares are owned by BCPE Rover Holdings, Inc.


-----

**Stock Options**

On June 21, 2019, the board of directors of BCPE Rover Holdings, Inc. (“BCPE Holdings”) ratified and approved
the adoption of the 2018 Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”), which authorizes BCPE Holdings to grant awards
to members of the board, officers and employees of the Company in BCPE Holdings, which is the indirect parent of
the Company. The Option Plan was adopted to incentive grant recipients to promote the long-term growth and
profitability of the Company and its affiliates. In accordance with the Option Plan, BCPE Holdings also authorized
550,000 shares of the Class B Common Stock of BCPE Holdings (“Class B Stock”) to be granted in the form of
nonqualified stock options. Stock compensation expense was $1.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The number of options granted to purchase Class B
Stock were 39,737 and 95,026 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Options granted under the Option Plan are be exercisable only to the extent that they are vested. Option grants are
divided into two vesting tranches: “Time-Vesting Options” and “Performance-Vesting Options,” with a 50%
allocation to each tranche. Time-Vesting Options vest over a five-year period following the vesting start date (which
is typically the grant date). Twenty percent of the Time-Vesting Options will vest on each anniversary of the grant
date until all Time-Vested Options are fully-vested. All Time-Vesting options provide for accelerated vesting upon a
change of control and 100% will vest upon a change in control; however, an initial public offering will not
accelerate vesting. Performance-Vesting Options are subject to time and performance vesting and will only be fully
vested when they have met both time and performance vesting requirements. Performance-Vesting Options will time
vest in the same manner as Time-Vesting Options. Performance-Vesting Options will performance vest as follows:
50% vesting if funds associated with Bain Capital (“Sponsor”) Returns (as defined in the Option Plan) through the
measurement date are at least two times the initial Sponsor investment and 100% vesting if Sponsor Returns are at
least three times the initial Sponsor investment. An IPO may result in the accelerated vesting of PerformanceVesting Options.

As of December 31, 2023, the grant date fair value of the Time-Vesting and Performance-Vesting Options were
$11.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively. Remaining unrecognized compensation expense was $3.1 million for
the unvested Time Vesting Options as of December 31, 2023 and is expected to be recognized over the related
weighted average period of 2 years. The Company recorded compensation expense for the Time Vesting Options of
$1.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
which was included in general and administrative, cost of sales, research & development, and sales and marketing
expenses.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not deemed the achievement of the vesting criteria of the PerformanceVesting Options to be probable, and therefore there has been no compensation expense recorded for these
performance-based vesting awards to date. Total unrecognized compensation expense was $10.6 million for the
unvested Performance-Vesting Options as of December 31, 2023. The Company will reassess the probability of
achieving investor return targets at the end of each reporting period.

The Company is a private company and lacks certain company-specific historical and implied volatility information.
Therefore, it estimates its expected option volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of
peer companies. The expected term of the Company’s equity interests is based on management’s estimate of time
until a potential liquidity event. The risk-free rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant of the award for the time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award.
Expected dividend yield is zero based on the fact that the Company does not expect to pay cash dividends.

The following assumptions were used by management to determine the fair value of the options granted as of the
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 valuation date:


-----

**13.** **Employee Benefit Plan**

The Company sponsors an employee retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
“401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan allows employees to make pretax contributions up to the maximum allowable
amount set by the Internal Revenue Service. Under the 401(k) Plan, the Company may match a portion of the
employee contribution up to a defined maximum and may make an additional, discretionary, profit-sharing
contribution. The Company made matching contributions of $3.5 million of the total $8.5 million in employee
retirement plans, $3.3 million of the total $6.9 million and $2.8 million of the total $5.4 million to the 401(k) Plan
for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**14.** **Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers**

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, billed and unbilled accounts receivable, and derivative instruments. At December 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances at certain financial institutions in
excess of federally insured limits. However, the Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with accredited
financial institutions and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk
associated with commercial banking relationships. Concentrated credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited to large, creditworthy customers and partners. The Company has not experienced material credit losses
related to receivables from individual partners, customers or groups of customers in any specific industry or
geographic area. The Company manages credit risk with counterparties on derivative instruments by trading among
several counterparties and by trading with accredited financial institutions. The Company has no significant offbalance-sheet concentration of credit risk.

As of December 31, 2023, one strategic partner accounted for 40% of the Company’s combined billed and unbilled
accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, one strategic partner accounted for 39% and one customer accounted
for 7% of the Company’s combined billed and unbilled and accounts receivable. No other customer or partner
accounted for more than 3% of the Company’s combined billed and unbilled accounts receivable for any period
presented.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a long-term strategic partnership with IBM. For the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we generated 40%, 38% and 35%, respectively, of our total revenue
from this partnership. No other customer or partner accounted for more than 7% of our total revenue during these
periods.

**15.** **Derivatives**

**_Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives_**

The Company enters into derivative instruments to manage risks related to its business operations and economic
conditions. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign exchange risk
in order to reduce the risk that the Company’s cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be
adversely affected.


-----

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had the following derivatives:

**Number of**
**Notional Amount**
**Instruments**

Cash flow hedges
Interest rate swaps 5 $        1,165,000
Interest rate cap 1 $          154,000
Interest rate cap 1 €          300,000
Net investment hedge
Cross-currency swap 1 £          108,538

On October 18, 2023, the Company settled and unwound its non-designated EUR cross-currency swap, resulting in
cash proceeds of $37.1 million. This gain has been recognized in Other income (expense) over the life of the
contract through mark to market. The Company recognized a gain of $2.4 million, $32.2 million and $2.5 million as
of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

On October 31, 2023, the Company had its $200.0 million non-designated interest rate cap mature.

**_Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk_**

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate
products such as swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated
as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company
making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if
interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for a premium. During 2022 and 2023, such
derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. These contracts
have maturities of 23 months or less as of December 31, 2023.

For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the
derivative is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into
interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31,
2023, the net accumulated income deferred in AOCI on cash flow hedges before tax effect was $21.8 million, $18.6
million of which the Company expects will be reclassified to interest expense within the next 12 months.

**_Net Investment Hedges_**

The Company designated a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap agreement as a net investment hedge. The
Company’s risk management objective and strategy for the net investment hedge transaction is to protect a
designated monetary amount of the Company’s net investment in Rocket Software UK International, a GBPfunctional-currency consolidated subsidiary, against the risk of changes in the GBP-USD exchange rate. The
Company’s cross-currency swap involves the receipt of functional-currency-fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty
in exchange for the Company making foreign-currency fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement. The
cross-currency swap also involves a final (at maturity) exchange of the functional-currency principal amount(s) for
the foreign-currency principal amount(s).

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the unrealized gain or loss is reported in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or
substantially liquidated.


-----

**_Non-Designated Hedges_**

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s exposure to interest
rate and foreign exchange movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting
requirements and/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in Other income, net.

**_Derivatives Offsetting_**

The Company’s derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. The Company has elected to
record all derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting arrangements on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

The tables below present a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net presentation of the Company’s
derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands).


-----

**_Credit-risk-related Contingent Features_**

The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the
Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative
obligations.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company
had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2023, it would not have been required to settle any
obligations since none of the Company’s derivatives were in a liability position.

**16.** **Fair Value Measurements**

The guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, and establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair
value of the assets and liabilities.

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the
determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company
in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the
fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entityspecific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own
assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including
during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be
reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2
or Level 2 to Level 3.

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis (in thousands):

**December 31, 2023** **December 31, 2022**

**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**

The fair value of the Swap Agreements that resulted in the derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 were determined using the market approach technique. The interest rate cap agreement is
categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and


-----

accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these
instruments. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Rocket Software Inc.
debt was based on an outside market participant determined value, and the estimated fair value of RSD Debt was
based on its book value due to the variable interest rate. The carrying amount and estimated fair value for debt are as
follows (in thousands):

**December 31, 2023** **December 31, 2022**

**Carrying** **Fair** **Carrying** **Fair**
**Amount** **Value** **Amount** **Value**

2018 Term-based debt $    2,039,163 $    2,001,627 $    2,034,016 $    1,956,832
2019 Term-based debt (RSD) 19,696 19,696 19,271 19,271
2021 Senior Notes 575,000 496,656 575,000 451,375

Total debt $    2,633,859 $    2,517,979 $    2,628,287 $    2,427,478

The Company records assets and liabilities at fair value, such as for assets and liabilities acquired in a business
combination and upon impairments of long-lived assets. The fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets was
established using Level 3 inputs and considered relevant information including discounted cash flow analyses,
market data and management’s estimates.

**17.** **Restructuring and Transformation Costs**

In December 2023, the Company announced the decision to exit its operations in China as a broader initiative to colocate many of the application modernization products at the Company’s development centers located in Vilnius,
Lithuania; Pune, India; and Bentonville, Arkansas.

The cost of the China exit plan is estimated to be $16.0 million to $18.0 million and consists primarily of employeerelated costs. The Company incurred $7.3 million of expense related to the program in the fourth quarter of 2023,
which are included in General and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The
plan is expected to be complete in the first half of 2025.

In July 2023, management approved a plan to reduce its global workforce by approximately 5%. The plan was
substantially completed during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 with costs incurred of $6.4
million, which are included in General and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of
Operations.

Restructuring plan liabilities are included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Activity for the
period ended December 31, 2023 is summarized as follows (in thousands):


**Balance at January 1, 2023** $                Charged to expense - global workforce reduction 6,368
Charged to expense - China exit 7,300
Cash paid (4,365)
**Balance at December 31, 2023** $            9,303


During 2021, the Company began executing on a global reorganization and facilities consolidation plan to reduce
redundancies and achieve synergies relating to the integration of the Company’s acquisitions of Uniface and ASG.
The total cost of the plan was $57.2 million and was completed in the second quarter of 2023. The plan included
restructuring-related costs such as employee severance, other employee-related costs, asset impairments, and facility

### AMC Business of Open Text Corporation

###### Audited Combined Carveout Financial Statements As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 And for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 With Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Thereon


-----

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

The Board of Directors
Open Text Corporation:

_Opinion_

We have audited the combined carveout financial statements of the AMC Business of Open Text
Corporation (the AMC Business), which comprise the combined carveout balance sheets as of December
31, 2023 and 2022, the related combined carveout statements of income and comprehensive income,
changes in equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the combined
carveout financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying combined carveout financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the AMC Business as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

_Basis for Opinion_

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined Carveout Financial Statements section of our report. We
are required to be independent of the AMC Business and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in
accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

_Responsibilities of Management for the Combined Carveout Financial Statements_

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the combined carveout financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and for the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
combined carveout financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the combined carveout financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the AMC
Business’ ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the combined carveout
financial statements are issued.


-----

_Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined Carveout Financial Statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined carveout financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not
absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the
aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the combined
carveout financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:

   - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined carveout financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the combined carveout financial statements.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the AMC Business’ internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
combined carveout financial statements.

   - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the AMC Business’ ability to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

###### Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

_Organization_

The AMC Business (the “Business”), of Open Text Corporation (“OpenText”) includes Application Modernization & Connectivity
(“AMC”), historically a product group of Micro Focus International Limited, formerly known as Micro Focus International PLC,
(“Micro Focus”) and, beginning February 1, 2023, the OpenText Connectivity business (“OT Connectivity”), a product group of
OpenText. OpenText acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus on January 31, 2023 (“the Acquisition”).
The contribution of OT Connectivity is reflected as a transfer in of the OT Connectivity business in the Combined Carveout Statements
of Cash Flows, which represents OT Connectivity's net assets as of the Acquisition date, which is mainly comprised of goodwill and net
working capital, including accounts receivable and deferred revenues, and deferred tax assets. For the periods starting January 1, 2022
to the date of the Acquisition, reference to the “Parent” in these Combined Carveout Financial Statements is to Micro Focus. For the
period after the Acquisition starting on February 1, 2023, reference to the “Parent” in these Combined Carveout Financial Statements is
to Open Text.

The Business provides market leading mainframe modernization and connectivity software and its solutions are categorized in the
following areas: MF Common Business Oriented Language (“COBOL”), Host Connectivity, MF Enterprise Suite, Mainframe
Application Development Life Cycle Management (“ADLM”) and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (“CORBA”). The MF
COBOL product portfolio enables customers to develop, maintain, and deploy applications using COBOL across different platforms.
Host Connectivity, which is the portfolio containing OT Connectivity includes products for enterprises to manage host access across
desktop, web and mobile devices, manage mainframe access with enhanced security and integrate mainframe and host systems. MF
Enterprise Suite is a mainframe application which helps enterprises move mainframe workloads to the cloud, therefore, reducing costs
and increasing agility. Mainframe ADLM is comprised of products that offer enhanced mainframe applications which help shorten app
delivery cycles, including faster development and deployment, strengthen security via multifactor authentication and data encryption,
and optimize user interface experiences to boost productivity. The CORBA product facilitates distributed computing by providing a
standard process for software components to request services and exchange data in a networked environment.
On November 28, 2023, OpenText entered into a definitive agreement with Rocket Software, Inc. (“Rocket”), a Bain Capital portfolio
company, involving the purchase and sale of the Business (the “Transaction”). Under the Transaction, OpenText will receive
approximately $2.275 billion in cash at closing. Upon completion of the Transaction, the Business will be transferred by OpenText to a
newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket.

_Basis of Presentation_

The Combined Carveout Financial Statements prior to the date of the Acquisition represent the financial information of AMC’s portion
of the Business. Beginning February 1, 2023, the Combined Carveout Financial Statements represent the financial information
combining AMC’s portion and OT Connectivity’s portion of the Business, which is the date on which both were under common control
of OpenText.

The Combined Carveout Financial Statements have been prepared on a “carve-out” basis. The periods presented were prepared on a
standalone basis and have been derived from the accounting records of Micro Focus prior to the Acquisition and OpenText following
the Acquisition. The Combined Carveout Financial Statements herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Prior to the date of the Acquisition, the accounting records and financial information of Micro
Focus were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) and had a different fiscal year end. In
preparing the Combined Carveout Financial Statements, the Business has aligned to a fiscal period ended December 31 and have
converted any financial information to U.S. GAAP.


-----

The historical results of income, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows presented in the Combined Carveout Financial
Statements may not be indicative of what they would have been had the Business actually been an independent standalone entity, nor
are they necessarily indicative of the Business’ future results of income, comprehensive income, financial position and cash flows. It is
not practicable to estimate actual costs that would have been incurred had the Business been a separate, standalone company. Financial
information presented in the financial statements and notes herein is presented in thousands of U.S dollars, unless otherwise stated.

The Combined Carveout Financial Statements include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Business and an allocation of
expenses related to certain support services received from the Parent, such as, human resources, legal, finance, central and shared
technology, and various other Parent corporate functions and overhead. These expenses have been attributed to the Business based on
direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated using a reasonable methodology primarily on the basis of revenue
or headcount. Management considers these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services or the benefits received.

Corporate expense allocations were recorded in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income within the following captions:

General and administrative expense 46,993 35,434

Other (income) expense, net (735) 3,262

**Total** **$ 115,319** **$ 86,576**

The Combined Carveout Financial Statements include assets and liabilities specifically attributable to the Business. Parent’s net
investment, included within Equity, represents the Parent’s investment in the Business including accumulated net earnings attributable
to Parent, the net effect of transactions with Parent and cost allocations from the Parent that were not historically allocated to the
Business.

All intercompany transactions and balances within the Business have been eliminated. Transactions with the Parent and the Business
are deemed to have been settled immediately through Net parent investment and are reflected in Equity as Net transfers to/from Parent.

Cash has not been assigned to the Business for any of the periods presented because those cash balances are not directly attributable to
the Business as a centralized approach was used by the Parent to manage cash and financing of its operations. These arrangements are
not reflective of the manner in which the Business would have financed its operations had it been a standalone company separate from
the Parent during the periods presented. Cash pooling, related interest, and intercompany arrangements are excluded from the asset and
liability balances in the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets. These amounts have instead been reported within Net parent investment,
as a component of Equity.

The Parent’s long-term debt and related interest expense have not been attributed to the Business for any of the periods presented because
the Parent’s borrowings are neither directly attributable to the Business nor is the Business the legal obligor of such borrowings.

The Income tax provisions in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income have been calculated as if the Business filed a separate tax
return and was operating as a standalone company. Therefore, tax expense and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective
of the Business’s actual tax balances.

The Business operates as one reportable segment based upon the information used by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in
evaluating the performance of the Business and allocating resources and capital.


-----

**_Principles of Combination_**

The accompanying Combined Carveout Financial Statements include the accounts of the Business on a combined basis. The Business
also includes subsidiaries over which a direct or indirect legal or effective control exists and for which the Business is deemed to direct
the significant activities and has the obligation to absorb the losses or benefits of the entities. The Business does not constitute a solely
dedicated group of legal entities.

**_Use of estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Business to make certain estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and
assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. In particular, key estimates,
judgments and assumptions include those related to: (i) revenue recognition, (ii) accounting for income taxes, (iii) accounting for
allowance for doubtful accounts, (iv) accounting for goodwill and testing for impairment, (v) useful lives for property and equipment
and intangible assets, and (vi) the allocation of shared corporate costs.

###### Note 2. Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

**Accounting Policies**

**_Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses_**

In accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” (Topic 326), the Business recognizes expected credit losses
for accounts receivable and contract assets based on lifetime expected losses. Loss allowances are recognized using a collective
assessment for accounts receivable, including contract assets, with similar risk characteristics based on historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment. The Business continues to maintain an allowance
for 100% of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible.

Customer creditworthiness is evaluated prior to order fulfillment and based on evaluations; the Business adjusts the credit limit to the
respective customer. In addition to these evaluations, the Business conducts on-going credit evaluations of customers’ payment history
and current creditworthiness. To date, the actual losses have been within the Business’ expectations. No single customer accounted for
more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

**_Property and equipment_**

Property and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and shown net of depreciation which is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Gains and losses on asset disposals are taken into income in the
year of disposition. Fully depreciated property and equipment are retired from the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets when they are
no longer in use. Please see the “Impairment of long-lived assets” section below for policy on property and equipment impairments. The
following represents the estimated useful lives of property and equipment as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Computer hardware 1 to 5 years
Computer software 3 to 7 years

**_Leases_**

The Business enters into operating leases for certain facilities for use in the ordinary course of business. Leases with an initial term of
12 months or less are not recorded on the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets.


-----

In accordance with ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (Topic 842), the Business accounts for a contract as a lease when the Business has the
right to direct the use of the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Business
determines the initial classification and measurement of the right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement
date and thereafter if modified.

ROU assets represent the right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is the Business’ obligation to make
the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease, over the contractual term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized
on the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets based on the present value of future minimum lease payments to be made over the lease
term. When available, the Business will use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, real
estate leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore, the Business must estimate the incremental
borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The Business estimates the incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized basis
with similar terms and payments, in the economic environment where the leased asset is located.

The ROU asset equals the lease liability, adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent and lease incentives on initial recognition.
Fixed lease costs are included in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Variable lease costs are not included in the
measurement of the lease liability. These variable lease payments are recognized in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income in
the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments continues to be recognized
in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Business has not elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for
facility leases. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term only if it is reasonably
certain the Business will exercise those options. The leases typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive
covenants.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets
acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.

The Business performs a qualitative assessment to test the reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on the qualitative assessment,
if the Business determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to
be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, the
Business compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
value, goodwill is not considered impaired and the Business is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net
assets of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying
value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.

The Business has concluded that there is one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. The annual
impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The qualitative assessment indicated that there were
no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for the years ended December
31, 2023 or 2022.

**_Acquired intangibles_**

Acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships, inclusive of tradenames associated with various
acquisitions. Acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future incomeproducing capabilities of software products acquired in acquisitions. The Business amortizes acquired technology over its estimated
useful life on a straight-line basis.

Customer relationships and tradenames represent relationships that the Business has with customers of the acquired companies and are
either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable; that is, capable of being separated from the acquired entity and


-----

being sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. These customer relationships and tradenames are initially recorded at their fair
value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The Business amortizes technology, tradenames, and customer
relationship on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Technology 4 to 10 years
Tradenames 10 years
Customer relationships 7 to 10 years

The Business continually evaluates the remaining estimated useful life of the intangible assets being amortized to determine whether
events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.

**_Impairment of long-lived assets_**

The Business accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and
Equipment” (Topic 360). The Business tests long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment, ROU assets and definite
lived intangible assets, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business
climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses
associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the
end of its estimated useful life.

Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is
not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which
the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or
asset group.

The Business has not recorded any impairment charges for long-lived assets during 2023 or 2022.

**_Revenue recognition_**

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606), the Business accounts for a customer
contract when the Business obtains written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms,
are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as,
control of a promised product or service is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Business expects to
be entitled to in exchange for products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination
of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical,
current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and
circumstances of each arrangement. The Business reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities
that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.

The Business has three primary revenue streams: customer support, license, and professional service.

**_Customer support revenue_**

Customer support revenue is associated with perpetual and term license. As customer support is not critical to the customer’s ability to
derive benefit from its right to use software, customer support is considered as a distinct performance obligation when sold together in
a bundled arrangement along with the software.

Customer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-ifavailable basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer.
Customer support for term licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer


-----

support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. The customer
support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of
customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single
performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support
resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by the
Business will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end
dates of the maintenance term, in line with how the Business believes services are provided.

**_License revenue_**

License revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses and term licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer’s
premises.

**Perpetual licenses: The Business sells perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period**
of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Perpetual licenses provide a right to
use IP that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional
IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once
software activation keys have been made available for download.

**Term licenses: The Business sells term licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in**
exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual
licenses, term licenses include functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for term licenses, revenue
is recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software
activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.

**_Professional service revenue_**

Professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical and training services. Technical services
may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules
or delivering a training package customized to the customer’s needs. At the customer’s discretion, the Business may offer one, all, or a
mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or is a fee based on time and materials. Professional
services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.

As professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and customers can benefit from the Business’
professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, the Business considers professional services as
distinct within the context of the contract.

Professional service revenue is recognized over time so long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as
the Business performs them, (ii) performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as the Business performs, and (iii)
performance does not create an asset with alternative use and the Business has enforceable right to payment.

If all the above criteria are met, the Business uses an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For
example, total labor hours incurred compared to total expected labor hours may be considered. As a practical expedient, when a customer
is invoiced at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Business’ performance to date, the Business will
recognize revenue at that amount.


-----

**_Material rights_**

To the extent that the Business grants a customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of the arrangements, the
Business will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to
the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if a customer is given an option to
acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material
right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists
in one of the contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and the Business would recognize revenue only when those future
products or services are transferred or when the option expires.

Based on history, contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to the Combined
Carveout Financial Statements.

**_Arrangements with multiple performance obligations_**

Contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require
judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:

    - the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily
available to the customer; and

    - the Business’ promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the
contract.

If these criteria are not met, the Business determines an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of the Business’ overall
promise for the single performance obligation. If these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct
performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price
(“SSP”) basis.

**_SSP_**

The SSP reflects the price that would be charged for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and
to similar customers. In most cases, the SSP can be established based on observable data. The Business typically establishes a narrow
SSP range for the products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances
warrant a review.

If the SSP is not directly observable, then the Business estimates the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual
approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized. SSP is a formal process
whereby management considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographic or regional specific factors, competitive
positioning, internal costs, profit objectives, and pricing practices.

**_Transaction Price Allocation_**

In bundled arrangements, where the Business has more than one distinct performance obligation, the Business must allocate the
transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not
always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, the Business allocates the
transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because the Business
has determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. The Business uses the residual approach only for
license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within the established SSP range, then an
adjustment is required, and the Business will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support based on the relative
SSP established for the respective performance obligations.


-----

When two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, the Business evaluates the facts and
circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, the Business will
account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations
accordingly.

**_Sales to resellers_**

The Business executes certain sales contracts through resellers, distributors and channel partners (collectively referred to as resellers).
Typically, the Business concludes that the resellers are customers of the Business in reseller agreements. The resellers have control over
the pricing, service and products prior to being transferred to the end customer. The Business also assess the creditworthiness of each
reseller and if they are newly formed, undercapitalized or in financial difficulty, the Business defers any revenues expected to emanate
from such reseller and recognize revenue only when cash is received, and all other revenue recognition criteria under ASC Topic 606
are met.

**_Rights of return and other incentives_**

The Business does not generally offer rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions, product rotation, or price protection
and, therefore, do not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives.

Additionally, in some contracts, however, discounts may be offered to the customer for future software purchases and other additional
products or services. Such arrangements grant the customer an option to acquire additional products or services in the future at a discount
and therefore are evaluated under guidance related to “material rights” as discussed above.

**_Other policies_**

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days
of the invoice date. In certain arrangements, the Business will receive payment from a customer either before or after the performance
obligation to which the invoice relates has been satisfied. As a practical expedient, the Business does not account for significant financing
components if the period between when the Business transfers the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer
pays for the product or service will be one year or less. On that basis, contracts for license and maintenance typically do not contain a
significant financing component, however, in determining the transaction price the Business considers whether there is a need to adjust
the promised consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either the customer or the
Business with a significant benefit of financing.

The Business may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. The additional products and services will be
considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification and will be accounted for as a
separate contract. The Business evaluates whether the price for the additional products and services reflects the SSP adjusted as
appropriate for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In determining whether an adjustment is appropriate, the Business
evaluates whether the incremental consideration is consistent with the prices previously paid by the customer or similar customers.

Certain of the Business’ product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. The Business estimates
variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer-specific. The Business uses an expected value
approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to
determine the likelihood of incurring penalties.


-----

**_Performance Obligations_**

A summary of the typical performance obligations and when the obligations are satisfied are as follows:

**Performance Obligation** **When Performance Obligation is Typically Satisfied**
**Customer support revenue:**
When and if available updates and upgrades and technical support Ratable over the course of the service term (over time)
**License revenue:**
Software licenses (Perpetual and Term) When software activation keys have been made available for download
(point in time)
**Professional service revenue:**
Professional services As the services are provided (over time)

**_Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract with a Customer_**

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that the Business incurs to obtain a contract that would not have
incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions. The Business has determined that certain of the commission
programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Some commission programs are not subject to capitalization as the commission
expense is paid and recognized as the related revenue is recognized. In assessing costs to obtain a contract, the Business applies a
practical expedient that allows the Business to assess incremental costs on a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics instead of
assessing the incremental costs on each individual contract. The Business does not expect the financial statement effects of applying
this practical expedient to the portfolio of contracts to be materially different than if the Business were to apply the standard to each
individual contract.

The Business pays commissions on the sale of new customer contracts as well as for renewals of existing contracts to the extent the
renewals generate incremental revenue. Commissions paid on renewal contracts are limited to the incremental new revenue and therefore
these payments are not commensurate with the commission paid on the original sale. The Business allocates commission costs to the
performance obligations in an arrangement consistent with the allocation of the transaction price. Commissions allocated to the license
performance obligation are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to professional service
performance obligations are expensed as incurred, as these contracts are generally for one year or less and the Business applies a practical
expedient to expense costs as incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. Commissions allocated to customer
support are capitalized and amortized consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the services over the period expected to
benefit from the commission payment. As commissions paid on renewals are not commensurate with the original sale, the period of
benefit considers anticipated renewals. The benefit period is estimated to be approximately six years which is based on customer
contracts and the estimated life of technology.

Expenses for incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract are recorded within “Sales and marketing” expense in the Combined
Carveout Statements of Income.

Short-term capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets”, while long-term capitalized
costs to obtain a contract are included in “Other assets” on the Combined Carveout Balance Sheets.

**_Research and development costs_**

Research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed are
expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization, as described in ASC Topic 985-20, “Costs of Software
to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” (Topic 985-20). In accordance with Topic 985-20, costs related to research, design and development
of products are charged to expense as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically
feasible and is considered to be ready for general release to customers. Based on historical experience, the dates relating to the
achievement of technological feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided. In addition, no significant costs
are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. As a result, the Business does not capitalize any research and
development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed.

|Performance Obligation|When Performance Obligation is Typically Satisfied|
|---|---|
|Customer support revenue: When and if available updates and upgrades and technical support License revenue: Software licenses (Perpetual and Term) Professional service revenue: Professional services|Ratable over the course of the service term (over time) When software activation keys have been made available for download (point in time) As the services are provided (over time)|


-----

**_Advertising Expenses_**

Advertising costs, which include digital advertising, marketing programs and other promotional costs, are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expenses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $11,804 and $5,404, respectively
and recorded in Sales and Marketing expenses.

**_Income taxes_**

Income taxes as presented in the Business’ Combined Carveout Financial Statements consist of current and deferred income taxes of
Parent in a manner that is systematic, rational and consistent with the principles of FASB ASC Topic 740: Income Taxes (“ASC 740”).
Accordingly, the Business’ income tax provision was prepared following the separate return method. The separate return method applies
ASC 740 to the stand-alone financial statements of each member of the consolidated group as if the group members were a separate
taxpayer and a stand-alone enterprise. The calculation of the Business’ income taxes on a separate return basis requires a considerable
amount of judgment and use of both estimates and allocations. As a result, actual transactions included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent may not be included in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements. Similarly, the tax treatment of certain items
reflected in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements may not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns
of Parent. Therefore, items such as net operating losses, credit carry-forwards and valuation allowances may exist in the stand-alone
financial statements that may or may not exist in Parent’s consolidated financial statements. As such, the income taxes of the Business
as presented in the Combined Carveout Financial Statements may not be indicative of the income taxes that the Business will generate
in the future.

Certain operations of the Business have historically been included in a consolidated tax return with other Parent entities. Current
obligations or receivables are deemed settled with Parent as a component of net parent investment for purposes of the Combined
Carveout Financial Statements. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the Combined
Carveout Financial Statements in the period to which they relate as if the Business were a separate filer.

Deferred income taxes are recognized using the asset and liability method on temporary differences arising at the balance sheet date
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in
effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Business records valuation
allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of all deductible temporary differences, carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused
tax losses to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable income will be available against which the temporary differences can
be utilized. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are subject to review at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent
that future taxable income are considered to be inadequate to allow all or part of any deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are presented on a net basis for the same tax-paying component within the same tax jurisdiction.

The Business accounts for uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical
merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second
step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum
amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the
position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not
to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Business’ best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date,
although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. The Business recognizes both accrued interest and penalties related to
liabilities for income taxes within the “Provision for (recovery of) income taxes” line of the Combined Carveout Statements of Income
(see Note 10 “Income Taxes” for more details).


-----

**_Fair value of financial instruments_**

Carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable trade and accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate the fair value due to the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization.

**_Foreign currency_**

The Combined Carveout Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of entities is the local
currency. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the
previous month of the transaction. The effect of foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” Transactional foreign currency gains (losses) included in the Combined Carveout Statements of Income
under the line item “Other income (expense), net” for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $735 and
$(3,262), respectively.

**_Defined contribution plans_**

The Business has various defined contribution retirement plans around the world covering many of its employees. Under these plans,
employees can contribute a portion of their salary to the plan and the Business makes minimum non-elective contributions, discretionary
contributions, and matching contributions, depending on the terms of the specific plan. The majority of the plans are primarily located
in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Business made
contributions of $3,466 and $2,643, respectively, relating to the defined contribution retirement plans.

**_Share-based compensation_**

The Parent operated various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans during the periods and certain employees of the Business
participated in the Parent’s plans. Share-based compensation costs are measured in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “Compensation –
Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) on the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award. The Parent has elected to treat
awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the employee requisite service period, which in the Parent’s circumstance is the stated vesting period of the award, provided that total
compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro-rata value of the award that has vested. Compensation cost is initially based on the
estimated number of awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. This estimate is adjusted in the period once actual
forfeitures are known.

Over time 354,639 314,528

**Total revenues** **$ 507,683** **$ 448,335**

**_Contract Balances_**

A contract asset, net of allowance for credit losses, will be recorded if the Business has recognized revenue but do not have an
unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. For example, this will be the case if implementation services offered
in a software arrangement are identified as a separate performance obligation and are provided to a customer prior to the Business being
able to bill the customer. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional.

The balance for contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenues) for the periods indicated below were as follows:

As of December 31,

2023 2022

Short-term contract assets $ 4,907 $ 4,711

Long-term contract assets $ 2,664 $ 4,783

Short-term deferred revenues $ 172,842 $ 148,265

Long-term deferred revenues $ 23,094 $ 26,881

The difference in the opening and closing balances of contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from the timing difference
between the Business’ performance and customer payments. The Business fulfills obligations under a contract with a customer by
transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Business reclassified $5,738 (year ended December 31, 2022 – $2,188) of contract assets to receivables as a result of the right to the
transaction consideration becoming unconditional. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, there was no
significant impairment loss recognized related to contract assets.

The Business recognizes deferred revenue when consideration is received, or an amount of consideration is due from the customer for
future obligations to transfer products or services. Deferred revenues primarily relate to customer support agreements. The amount of


-----

revenue that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 that was related to deferred revenue balances at December 31,
2022 was $137,568 (year ended December 31, 2022 — $146,276).

**_Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations_**

As of December 31, 2023, approximately $128,396 of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations on
existing contracts. The Business expects to recognize approximately 49% of this amount over the next 12 months and the remaining

###### Note 10. Income Taxes 

The Business’ tax provision has been prepared using the separate return method as if the Business was a separate group of companies
under common ownership.

The following is a geographical breakdown of income before the provision for income taxes:


**Components of Income (Loss) before Provision (Benefit) for Income taxes are as follows:**


For the Year Ended December 31,


2023 2022

U.K. income (loss) $ 142,705 $ 152,845

Non-U.K. income (loss) 117,755 121,565

**Income before income taxes** **$ 260,460** **$ 274,410**

The provision for (recovery of) income taxes consisted of the following:

**Components of Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes are as follows:**


For the Year Ended December 31,


2023 2022


**Current income taxes:**

U.K. $ 30,959 $ 28,635

**Total deferred income taxes (recoveries)** (1,537) (9,495)

**Provision for income taxes** **$ 61,313** **$ 54,542**

While the Business is domiciled in Canada, due to the percentage of global operations subject to tax in the United Kingdom, the Business
uses the UK corporate tax rate in the reconciliation of the effective income tax rate.

A reconciliation of the combined UK corporate tax rate with the Business’ effective income tax rate is as follows:

**Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation of the Business** For the Year Ended December 31,

2023 2022

**Income (Loss) before income taxes** $ 260,460 $ 274,410

Expected provision for income taxes 61,208 52,138

Effect of foreign tax rate differences 2,236 7,420

Change in uncertain tax positions

Effect of rate change differential
39 (317)

Effect of tax credits
(905) (688)

**Provision for income taxes** **$ 61,313** **$ 54,542**

As a result of the increase in the UK corporate tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, the applicable UK corporate tax rate
for the year ended December 31, 2023 is 23.5%.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 varied from the statutory tax rate due to the Business' jurisdictional
mix of earnings and changes in uncertain tax positions partially offset by permanent differences and available tax credits. The effective
income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 varied from the statutory rate due to the Business’ jurisdictional mix of earnings
partially offset by available tax credits and changes in uncertain tax positions.

The primary components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows, for the periods indicated below:


-----

**Deferred Assets (Liabilities) of the Business:**


As of December 31,

2023 2022


**Deferred tax assets:**


Deferred revenue $ 8,276 $ 4,961

Employee benefits 1,430 3,726

Capitalized scientific research and development expenses 9,465 5,203

Non-capital loss carryforwards 35 22

Depreciation and amortization 642 1,788

Other 160 109

**Total deferred tax assets** **20,142** **15,974**

Valuation allowance      - (19)

**Net deferred income tax asset** **20,142** **15,955**


**Deferred tax liabilities:**


Lease liabilities (129) (161)

**Total deferred income tax liabilities** **(129)** **(161)**

**Net deferred tax asset** **$ 20,013** **$ 15,794**

The Business regularly evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance, if necessary, to
reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized (a likelihood of more than 50 percent). Significant
judgment is required to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary and the amount of such valuation allowance. The Business
continues to evaluate their taxable position and consider factors by taxing jurisdiction, including but not limited to factors such as
estimated taxable income, any historical experience of losses for tax purposes and the future growth of the Business. Based upon the
available evidence, management expects that the Business will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) based upon future
estimated taxable income.

The aggregate changes in the balance of the Business’ gross unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) were as follows:

**Unrecognized Tax Benefits:**

Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 $ 6,014

Increases on account of current year positions 348

Increases on account of prior year positions 769

Decreases on account of prior year positions (2,697)

**Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022** $ 4,434

Increases on account of current year positions 256

Increases on account of prior year positions 179

**Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023** **$ 4,869**

Included in the above tabular reconciliation are unrecognized tax benefits of $4,869 and $4,434 as of December 31, 2023 and December
31, 2022, respectively, that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate.

The Business and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local, and foreign
jurisdictions. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were immaterial as of December 31, 2023.


-----

The Business and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all major taxing jurisdictions in which the Business operates. The Parent’s
tax filings remain subject to audits by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings
relate. The Parent currently has income tax audits open in Canada, the United States, Germany and other immaterial jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2023, the Business had immaterial deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the
undistributed earnings of certain non-US subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from subsidiaries, that would be subject to
withholding taxes upon distribution.

###### Note 11. Segment Information

ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” (Topic 280), establishes standards for reporting, by public business enterprises, information about
operating segments, products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The method of determining what information, under
Topic 280, to report is based on the way that an entity organizes operating segments for making operational decisions and how the
entity’s management and CODM assess an entity’s financial performance. The Business operates as one segment based upon the
information used by the CODM in evaluating the performance of the Business and allocating resources and capital.

###### Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 

**_Legal_**

In the ordinary course of business, the Business may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Where it is determined, in
consultation with internal and external counsel, that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in a given matter, the Business
establishes an accrual in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of these Combined Carveout Financial Statements, the
aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to the Business’ Combined Carveout Financial Statements and the Business does
not believe as of the date of these Combined Carveout Financial Statements that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the
amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to the Business’ Combined Carveout Financial Statements.

###### Note 13. Subsequent Events

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 855, Subsequent Events, management evaluated all material events subsequent to the
balance sheet date through March 28, 2024, the date of issuance of these Combined Carveout Financial Statements, for events
