“OMNOVA Group”) by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the Offering. The Notes will be issued
pursuant to an indenture to be dated, 2020 (the “Indenture”) among, inter alios, the Issuer and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as trustee (the “Trustee”). Interest on
the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on      and of each year, commencing on     , 2020. The Notes will mature on     , 2025.

**Memorandum”). Prior to     , 2022, the Issuer will be entitled to redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal**
amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in
this Offering Memorandum. Prior to, 2022, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, also redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after
the redemption. Additionally, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required

and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment. The Notes and Guarantees will be effectively
subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ existing and future secured obligations, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such debt, unless
such property or assets also secure the Notes or Guarantees, as applicable, on an equal and ratable or senior basis. The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated
to all existing and future obligations of subsidiaries of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, that do not guarantee the Notes. The validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.” The Guarantees may be

This Offering Memorandum is not an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any Notes by any person in
any jurisdiction in which it is unlawful for such person to make such an offering or solicitation. No action has
been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that
purpose.

information and the information from third-party sources under the heading “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”

for accurately summarizing the information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream, we accept no further
responsibility in respect of such information.

We cannot guarantee that our application for the listing and admission to trading of the Notes on the ISM will be
approved at any time, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing.

permitted under the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction pursuant to registration

**NOTICE TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND UNITED KINGDOM INVESTORS**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state
of the EEA or in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129
(the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

The Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to and should not be offered or sold to any retail investor in the
EEA or in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)**
of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling any in scope instrument or otherwise making such
instruments available to retail investors in the EEA or in the United Kingdom has been prepared. Offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of each of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels. References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to
the United Kingdom, those Regulations or Directives as they form part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue
of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in United Kingdom domestic law, as
appropriate.

invested, operating margin, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions, our competitive strengths

Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “potential,” “expect,” “intend,” “predict,” “project,”
“could,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “plan,” “aim,” “seek” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are largely based on our expectations,
which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our
best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors, some of which are discussed below.
In addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. We caution all readers
that the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum are not guarantees of future
performance, and we cannot assure any reader that such statements will be realized or the forward-looking events
and circumstances will occur.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and
specific, many of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among other
things, those listed in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as those included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. You should be aware that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking
statements. These factors include:

- the outbreak of COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics;

- our access to credit and ability to borrow or raise capital, as well as the ability of our suppliers and
customers to access credit and borrow or raise capital;

This list of factors above and the other factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive.
Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of
operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate. New risks can
emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all
such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and
uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, we do
not intend, and do not undertake any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering
Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR SYNTHOMER**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from the
audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer and related notes thereto as of and for each of the years
ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (the “Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements”), and the
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2020 (with unaudited comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2019) and related notes
thereto (the “Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements are, in each case, prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), IFRS Interpretations Committee and
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Synthomer Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34
_Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”). The Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements and the Synthomer_
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in pounds sterling. Synthomer has a December
financial year end.

The Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements and the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The financial statements of the Issuer (as a
standalone entity) as of and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have not been
included in this Offering Memorandum. The Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in
conjunction with the relevant reports of our independent auditors, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, as such reports relate to the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements. For a complete
description of the basis of preparation and accounting policies followed in preparing the Synthomer Consolidated
Financial Statements, see note 2 of the notes to the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations for Synthomer.”_

The Synthomer unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been calculated
by subtracting Synthomer’s unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived
from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) from Synthomer’s results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 (derived from the Synthomer Consolidated Financial
Statements) and then adding Synthomer’s unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
2020 (derived from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). The unaudited
financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes
only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial
condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.

Following a review in 2018, a new organization structure was adopted starting from January 1, 2019, to reflect
the increasing global nature of our operations. Upon such adoption, the following global operating segments
replaced the previous regional operating segments: Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industrial
Specialities. For further information on the operating segments presented under the new organizational structure
for the year ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum, see note 38 of the notes to the audited
consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and note 5 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Synthomer—
_Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Accounting Standards—Organizational Restructuring of Business_
_Segments.” Comparisons of financial results for the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 in this_
Offering Memorandum have been presented based on the prior segmental basis while comparisons of financial
results for the financial years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 have been presented based on the new
organization structure described above. Acrylates, which for the year ended December 31, 2019 was reported as
part of Industrial Solutions, has since become the fourth global operating segment, and has been reported
separately as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, the comparisons of financial results for the three months ended March
31, 2019 and 2020 in this Offering Memorandum have been presented based on the updated organizational


-----

structure as of January 1, 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of_ _Operations for Synthomer.”_

On January 13, 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) published IFRS 16 (Leases), and
the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. Synthomer adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from January
1, 2019, which has had an impact on its reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow
statement. In implementing IFRS 16, Synthomer’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements and certain financial tables presented in this Offering Memorandum include,
where applicable, a reconciliation of the results of operations of Synthomer for the year ended December 31, 2019
(which were prepared in accordance with IFRS 16) to the results of operations of Synthomer for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (for which IFRS 16 was not applicable) in order to facilitate a comparison of Synthomer’s
results of operations for the periods presented. As a result, Synthomer’s results as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2018 may not be comparable with the financial information presented as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2019. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations for Synthomer—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Accounting Standards—Changes to_
_Accounting Standards—IFRS 16 (Leases).”_

IFRS 9 was adopted by European Commission Regulation 2067/2016 of 22 November 2016, with effective
application date for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. It addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of
financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model
for financial assets. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the
unaudited comparative period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no
restatements applied to the unaudited financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017
presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We have chosen to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.

IFRS 15 was adopted by European Commission Regulation 1905/2016 of 22 September 2016, with an effective
mandatory application date for years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. This replaced IAS 18 which covered
contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covered construction contracts. The new standard is based on
the principle that revenue is recognized when performance obligations are met and control of goods or services
transfers to a customer. The standard applies a five step approach to the timing of revenue recognition. The
adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited comparative
period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the
unaudited financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated
financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

See note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 of
Synthomer, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, for further information on the adoption of IFRS
15 and IFRS 9 and their impact on the consolidated financial statements as applicable.

The preparation of financial information in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations for Synthomer—Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates, Judgements and_
_Assumptions” and note 2 (Significant accounting policies) of the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements_
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial information are disclosed in the notes to the financial information included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

The discussion of financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is primarily based on Synthomer’s
Underlying performance, which represents our statutory performance under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special
Items, as discussed further below under “—Non-IFRS Financial Measures For Synthomer.”


-----

The Synthomer financial information included in this Offering Memorandum does not and is not intended to
comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR OMNOVA**

The financial information of the OMNOVA Group presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum has
been derived from OMNOVA Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of November 30, 2018 and
2019 and for each of the financial years ended November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (the “OMNOVA Consolidated
**Financial Statements”), and OMNOVA Group’s unaudited consolidated interim financial information as of and**
for the three months ended February 29, 2020 (with comparative figures for the three months ended February 28,
2019) and the notes thereto (the “OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements and the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
are, in each case, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”). The
OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements and the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are
prepared in U.S. dollars. OMNOVA had a November financial year end pre-Acquisition.

The OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements and the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the relevant audit report of OMNOVA Group’s independent auditors as such report
relates to the OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements.

The OMNOVA unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 has been
calculated by subtracting OMNOVA’s results of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived
from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) from OMNOVA’s results of operations for the
year ended November 30, 2019 (derived from the OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements) and then adding
OMNOVA’s results of operations for the three months ended February 29, 2020 (derived from the OMNOVA
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). The financial information for the twelve months ended February 29,
2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of OMNOVA’s results
of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary
course of our financial reporting.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and
liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with a lease term of more than twelve months.
Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition,
measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease. The new guidance is effective for
OMNOVA’s financial year that begins on December 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective approach to
the adoption for lessees related to capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. OMNOVA
has estimated the impact to be approximately $27.0 million recognized as total right-of-use assets and
approximately $28.5 million for total lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 1, 2019,
inclusive of financing leases that were previously recognized as capital leases. OMNOVA also recognized a
cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.3 million for the accounting impact of the fair value of
right of use assets and previously recorded prepaid lease expense. Other than this impact, it is not expected that
the new standard will have a material impact on the remaining consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. For further information, see _Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted of the notes to the audited_
consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 of OMNOVA included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which
removes the prohibition against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intraentity transfers other than inventory. The guidance was effective for annual periods, including interim periods
within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted as of the beginning
of the annual reporting period in which the ASU was issued. ASU 2016-16 was adopted by OMNOVA effective
December 1, 2017 on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a $6.9 million adjustment to retained earnings
and a reduction in prepaid assets for the financial year ended November 30, 2018.


-----

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies existing
accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-14, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which_
deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to financial year 2019. This standard prescribes a five-step model for
recognizing revenue, the application of which will require a certain amount of judgment. The provisions of this
ASU may be applied retroactively or on a modified retrospective (cumulative effect) basis. The standard requires
additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including qualitative and quantitative
disclosures identifying the nature, amount, timing and significant judgments impacting revenue from contracts
with customers. OMNOVA adopted ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of financial year 2019 and utilized the
modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million
for the accounting impact of certain previously capitalized contract costs as of December 1, 2018.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and
_Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires that an employer report the service cost component in_
the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees
during the period. The amendments in this ASU also allow only the service cost component to be eligible for
capitalization when applicable. ASU 2017-07 must be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service
cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively,
on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in
assets. OMNOVA adopted ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of financial year ended November 30, 2019 and
elected to use the practical expedient to use amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of
OMNOVA as of and for the year ended November 30, 2018, as an estimate for applying the retrospective
presentation requirements. As a result, selling, general, and administrative expense increased with an offsetting
increase to other (income) expense of $2.0 million and $1.5 million for the financial years ended November 30,
2018 and 2017, respectively. Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not have an impact
on OMNOVA’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial year ended November 30, 2019.

The preparation of financial information in accordance with US GAAP requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of_ _Operations for OMNOVA—Critical Accounting Judgements.” It also requires management to exercise its_
judgement in the process of applying OMNOVA Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
information are disclosed in the notes to the financial information included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of Synthomer and
OMNOVA and their respective subsidiaries, the terms of the offering and the financial information included
herein. We urge you to consult your own advisors regarding the differences between IFRS and US GAAP and
how these differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum.

**ENLARGED GROUP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Following completion of the Acquisition, OMNOVA became a subsidiary of Synthomer and the accounting
policies, where applicable, applied to the OMNOVA Group have become the same as those applied to Synthomer,
including the adoption of IFRS and the adoption of a calendar year-end. Effective from the Completion Date,
Synthomer has commenced consolidating OMNOVA’s financial information and will prepare consolidated
financial statements of Synthomer as the Enlarged Group in accordance with IFRS.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in respect of the Enlarged Group presented
in this Offering Memorandum includes: (a) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement for
the year ended December 31, 2019 with the related explanatory notes thereto (the “2019 Unaudited Pro Forma
**Condensed Combined Income Statement”), (b) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement**
for the three months ended March 31, 2020 with the related explanatory notes thereto (the “Unaudited Pro Forma
**Condensed Combined Interim Income Statement”, together with the 2019 Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed**
Combined Income Statement, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements”), and
(c) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2020 with the related explanatory
notes thereto (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet” and, together with the


-----

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
**Combined Financial Information”). The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements have**
been prepared giving effect to drawings under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility,
the Bridge Facilities, the repayment under the 2018 Revolving Facility, the Rights Issue, the Acquisition (the
“Acquisition and Related Financing”), the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use
_of Proceeds” (the “Refinancing” and, together with the Acquisition and Related Financing, the “Transactions”)_
as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance
Sheet has been prepared giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2020. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is based on available information and various
assumptions that management believe to be reasonable. The Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Combined_
Financial Information includes unaudited _pro forma adjustments that are factually supportable and directly_
attributable to the Transactions. In addition, with respect to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Income Statements, the unaudited _pro forma adjustments are expected to have a continuing impact on the_
consolidated income statements of Synthomer.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum
has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of Synthomer as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with IAS 34, included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering
Memorandum has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of OMNOVA as of November
30, 2018 and 2019 and for each of the financial years ended November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 prepared in
accordance with US GAAP and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of OMNOVA as of and
for the three months ended February 29, 2020 prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial
statements.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is prepared, unless otherwise specified,
on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of Synthomer consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The OMNOVA consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The unaudited pro forma financial information relating to
OMNOVA reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been derived
through unaudited _pro forma adjustments from the OMNOVA consolidated financial statements prepared in_
accordance with US GAAP and adjusted, as applicable, to IFRS and the accounting policies as applied by
Synthomer.

We have assessed the OMNOVA financial information to identify any material differences between IFRS and US
GAAP. Unaudited _pro forma adjustments from this assessment are presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma_
Condensed Combined Financial Information; however, we have not attempted to quantify all differences that
would have been identified if the historical OMNOVA financial information had been prepared in accordance
with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the adjustments described in the notes to the Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information are a complete summary of all the differences that would
result had a full IFRS conversion been prepared. Had such a conversion been made, other accounting and
disclosure differences may have come to our attention that are not identified in the notes to the Unaudited Pro
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information, some of which may be material._

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been prepared on the basis that the
Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to IFRS, which requires
the recognition and measurement of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value as at
the date control is obtained and the purchase price. The purchase accounting adjustments to record the assets and
liabilities at fair value have not yet been finalized. The fair value adjustments, when finalized, may be material.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been adjusted to reflect any
matters not directly attributable to implementing the Transactions. No adjustment, therefore, has been made for
any of the integration plans related to the Acquisition. The actual financial results may differ materially from those
reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for a number of reasons,


-----

including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information and actual amounts. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information is provided for illustrative purposes and as supplemental information to facilitate
management discussion and analysis and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of
operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative
of future consolidated results of operations or financial position at any future date. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Acquisition.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information set forth in this Offering Memorandum is
based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable and may
differ materially from the actual amounts that would have been achieved had the Transactions occurred on the
respective dates mentioned above.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information does not include all information required
for financial statements under IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the Synthomer Consolidated Financial
Statements and OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Neither the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information nor the Unaudited As Adjusted
Combined Pro Forma Information included herein has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Article 11 of Regulation S‑X of the Securities Act, the Prospective Regulation or any generally accepted
accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted audited standards. Any information you place on this information should fully take this into
consideration.

**UNAUDITED AS ADJUSTED COMBINED** **_PRO FORMA_** **INFORMATION FOR THE ENLARGED**
**GROUP**

The unaudited as adjusted combined pro forma information for the Enlarged Group (the “Unaudited As Adjusted
**Combined Pro Forma Information”) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been calculated by adding**
the 2019 Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement and the Unaudited_ _Pro Forma_
Condensed Combined Interim Income Statement, and then subtracting Synthomer’s unaudited results of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IAS 34) and the unaudited results of operations
of OMNOVA for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial statements). The Unaudited
As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the Enlarged Group includes as adjusted run-rate pro forma
EBITDA, as adjusted pro forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of
unhedged interest derivatives presented as Special Items), the ratio of pro forma net borrowings to as adjusted
run-rate pro forma EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA to as adjusted pro forma
finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives
presented as Special Items). This Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,
Synthomer’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or
applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma
Information, and, accordingly, do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reports included in this Offering Memorandum relate to Synthomer’s previously
issued consolidated financial statements. It does not extend to the Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma
Information and should not be read to do so. The Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of the Enlarged Group’s results
of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary
course of our financial reporting.

**NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR SYNTHOMER**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included references to certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including
Underlying performance, EBITDA, EBITDA per tonne, capital expenditures, working capital and net borrowings.
None of these non-IFRS measures and ratios should be construed as an alternative to any IFRS measure such as


-----

revenue, operating profit/(loss), profit/(loss) for the year or net cash flow from operating activities. References to
EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum are to Underlying EBITDA unless otherwise specified.

We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items and we define
EBITDA per tonne as EBITDA per wet kilo tonne. We believe that EBITDA and EBITDA per tonne provide
useful information to investors about our results of operations because they are among the measures used by our
board of directors (“Board”) and management to evaluate our Underlying operating performance, review business
trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions, and they allow a
comparison of our results across periods on a consistent basis by removing the effects on our operating
performance of our capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset base and capital
investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and items largely outside the control of management
(such as income taxes). Accordingly, such measures are reported within our Annual Report and half year report.
In addition, you should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the
future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Our presentation of EBITDA and
EBITDA per tonne should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual
or irregular items. EBITDA and EBITDA per tonne should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
measures of our operating performance in accordance with IFRS.

We define Underlying performance as the statutory performance of Synthomer under IFRS, excluding the effect
of Special Items (as defined below).

We define capital expenditures as the purchase of property, plant and equipment as recorded on our consolidated
cash flow statement.

We define net borrowings as total current (including bank overdrafts) and non-current borrowings, less cash and
cash equivalents.

We define working capital as inventories plus trade and other receivables less trade and other payables.

When reviewing performance, the directors and management use a combination of both IFRS and non-IFRS
(Underlying) performance measures. The Underlying performance measures provide additional information in
line with how financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. We believe that nonIFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ongoing operations and of our ability to incur and service our
indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You
should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other
companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. For example, EBITDA has
limitations including the following: (i) it does not reflect our capital expenditures or capitalized development
costs, our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) it does not reflect changes
in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) it does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash
requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and (iv) although depreciation and
amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in
the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements.

The discussion of financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is primarily based on our
Underlying performance, which represents our statutory performance under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special
Items (as defined below).

The definition of Special Items has been consistently applied across the periods presented in this Offering
Memorandum. Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of the business’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure our consolidated
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the business in
the year. The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a more clear indication of
our Underlying performance:

- re-structuring and site closure costs;

- sale of a business or significant asset;


-----

- acquisition costs;

- amortization of acquired intangible assets;

- impairment of non-current assets;

- fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments where hedge accounting is not
applied;

- items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature;

- tax impact of above items; and

- settlement of prior period tax issues.

We believe that presenting “Underlying performance” as an alternative performance measure provides additional
clarity for our investors and stakeholders on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses and it is the
primary focus of Synthomer’s narrative reporting.

The non-IFRS financial measures and ratios of Synthomer included in this Offering Memorandum are not
intended to comply with reporting requirements of the Prospectus Regulation or the requirements of Regulation
S-X of the Securities Act, or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying
the related adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed in accordance
with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**NON-US GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR OMNOVA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included references to certain non-US GAAP financial measures of the
OMNOVA Group’s financial performance as defined by the SEC. Management for the OMNOVA Group
reviewed the adjusted financial measures in assessing the performance of its business segments and in making
decisions regarding the allocation of resources to its business segments. Management for the OMNOVA Group
also considered the adjusted information useful in providing investors with an understanding of the OMNOVA
Group’s business and operating performance.

The non-US GAAP measures contained in this document should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute
for, measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, the relevant non-US GAAP measures
presented by the OMNOVA Group may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other
businesses, as such businesses may define and calculate such measures differently than the OMNOVA Group,
and hence, undue reliance should not be placed on the non-US GAAP measures contained in this Offering
Memorandum.

**NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR THE ENLARGED GROUP**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included references to certain non-IFRS measures and ratios for the
Enlarged Group, including _pro forma_ net borrowings, _pro forma EBITDA, as adjusted run-rate_ _pro forma_
EBITDA, _pro forma_ finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged
interest derivatives), as adjusted pro forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair
value of unhedged interest derivatives presented as Special Items), the ratio of pro forma net borrowings to as
adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA and the ratio of as adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA to as adjusted pro
_forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives_
presented as Special Items). None of these non-IFRS measures and ratios should be construed as an alternative to
any IFRS measure such as revenue, operating profit/(loss), profit/(loss) for the year or net cash flow from operating
activities.

We define _pro forma_ net borrowings as the total of current (including bank overdrafts) and non-current
borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents as adjusted for the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31,
2020.


-----

We define pro forma EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items as adjusted
for the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019.

We define as adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA as pro forma EBITDA as adjusted to give effect to twelve
months of trading from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, by adding _pro_ _forma EBITDA for the year ended_
December 31, 2019, pro _forma EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and estimated run-rate pre-_
tax cost synergies for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (converted using an average exchange rate for the
period of £1.00 = $1.2707), and then subtracting Synthomer’s EBITDA for the three months ended March 31,
2019 (derived from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance
with IAS 34) and the OMNOVA EBITDA for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived from the
OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim
financial statements and converted using an average exchange rate of for the period of £1.00 = $1.3049)).

We define _pro forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged_
interest derivatives) as finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged
interest derivatives) as adjusted for the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019.

We define as adjusted pro forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of
unhedged interest derivatives presented as Special Items) as pro forma finance costs (excluding interest element
of lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives) as adjusted to give effect to twelve months of
trading from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, by adding pro _forma finance costs (excluding interest element of_
lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and pro
_forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives)_
for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and then subtracting Synthomer’s finance costs (excluding interest

**NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR SYNTHOMER**

Following a review in 2018, we decided to implement a new organizational group structure starting from January
1, 2019, to reflect the increasingly global nature of our operations. The new organizational structure centers on
Performance Elastomers comprising our Nitrile Butadiene Rubber latex (“NBR”) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber
latex (“SBR”) products, Functional Solutions comprising our Dispersions products and Industrial Specialities
comprising our Specialities products. Following the Acquisition, a new management structure was implemented,
and the Acrylates business, which was managed and reported within the Industrial Specialities segment for the
year ended December 31, 2019, was identified as a separate segment. As of January 1, 2020, management
information for Acrylates has been reported separately to our Executive Committee. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Synthomer—Results of_
_Operations—_ _Comparison of Underlying Financial Results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020.”_

We believe our new reporting structure will enable us to better leverage our global product portfolio and customer
relationships, better exploit our R&D capability within chemistries, and bring greater operational focus to
production sites.

We have now focused our sales, marketing, research and development and production teams by operating segment
into dedicated global teams while retaining very strong regional strength and local focus. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, we operated through the following three global operating segments:

**_Performance Elastomers_**

Performance Elastomers is focused on healthcare, carpet, paper and foam markets through our water-based NBR
and SBR products.

**_Functional Solutions_**

Functional Solutions is focused on coatings, construction, adhesives and technical textiles markets through our
water-based acrylic and vinylic based dispersions products.

**_Industrial Specialities_**

Industrial Specialities is focused on speciality chemical additives and non-water-based chemistry for a broad range
of applications from polymer additives to emerging materials and technologies. Acrylate monomers
manufacturing, which supplies our European Functional Solutions business and certain external customers in
European Markets, was reported as a part of Industrial Specialities segment prior to the year ended December 31,
2019.

Our Executive Committee is the chief operating decision maker and primarily uses EBITDA to assess the
performance of each of the operating segments listed above. No information is provided to the executive
committee at the segment level concerning interest income, interest expense, income tax or other material noncash items. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
_Synthomer—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Accounting Standards— Organizational Restructuring of_

**Our Business**

We are a major global producer of water-based polymers. We primarily produce water-based polymers through
an emulsion polymerization process, which removes the requirement for large amounts of volatile organic solvents
during production and use. These polymers are composed of different chemical building blocks (monomers) that
lead to the different products we produce. As a global leader in water-based polymer chemistry, our purpose is to
continually innovate to meet the needs of our customers and society in a sustainable way. Our water-based
products eliminate the use of significant quantities of volatile organic compounds, with our innovation KPI rapidly
introducing state of the art products which are both regulatory and environmentally compliant.

Our combination with OMNOVA has further enhanced our position as a major global speciality chemicals
company catering to a diverse range of attractive end-sectors, with a broad range of chemistries ranging from
acrylic, vinylic and speciality emulsions polymers to SB and acrylonitrile-butadiene latexes. In addition, the
Acquisition enables us to build on our strategy of focusing on application development, with the opportunity to
secure new long-term customer relationships through value-added solutions. The Acquisition also enhances our
global platform in speciality coatings and ingredients, increasing our exposure to attractive coatings and additives
for oil and gas drilling, cementing and stimulation end-sectors, as well as creating a major global player in waterbased polymer solutions and expanding our international range. We manufacture products for a diversified
customer base and produce chemical formulations for approximately 6,000 customers worldwide, including global
blue-chip companies. We use our technical services expertise and R&D capability to understand and anticipate
our customers’ needs. We are able to meet our customers’ requirements promptly through our 38 manufacturing
sites located across 24 countries, through product development at Synthomer’s four R&D centers and with the
assistance of approximately 4,750 employees as of December 31, 2019.

We recognize the importance of innovation to our success and to that of our customers and we have an impressive
track record and pipeline of new product development through customer-focused R&D. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer invested £16.6 million in R&D and new products, while products developed in
the preceding five years, comprised 22% of Synthomer’s sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We operate through three global operating segments aligned to our product offerings: Performance Elastomers
(NBR and SBR), Functional Solutions (Dispersions) and Industrial Specialities (Specialities). As of January 1,
2020, information for our acrylate monomers business, which had previously formed part of our Industrial
Specialities segment, has been reported separately as Acrylates.

Prior to January 1, 2019, we operated under a geographically segmented structure but have since revised our
structure to enable us to better leverage our global product portfolio and customer relationships, exploit our R&D
capability within chemistries, and bring greater operational focus to production sites. The new structure further
allows us to be closer to our customers to meet their global demands, accelerate our sales growth, sharpen our
commercial focus and drive operational efficiencies. We focus our sales, marketing, research and development
and production teams by operating segment into dedicated global teams with very strong regional strength and
local focus as follows:

- _Performance Elastomers: This segment focuses on the healthcare and protection, paper, carpet,_
compounds and foam sectors through our NBR and SBR latex products. For the year ended December
31, 2019, Performance Elastomers had revenue of £623.7 million and volumes of 849.1 kilotonnes,
representing 42.7% of our revenue and 57.9% of total volumes of products sold during this period, with
EBITDA of £96.3 million and Underlying operating profit of £71.5 million.

`o` _Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (“NBR”): We produce NBR primarily for the health and protection_
end markets for use in medical gloves and medical devices. NBR products have excellent barrier
and tear properties and are resistant to oils and chemicals. For the year ended December 31,
2019, NBR products comprised 23% of total volumes of products sold. We are the secondlargest producer of NBR latex by both revenue and volume globally, according to Kline.

`o` _Styrene_ _Butadiene_ _Rubber_ (“SBR”): We produce SBR for use in coated paper and packaging,
carpet backing and foam, mattresses, pillows and shoes. The SBR latex polymers we produce
are water-based synthetic polymers that are manufactured by an emulsion polymerization
process, which leads to products with excellent properties as binders in multiple industrial end

manufacturing sectors through our non-water-based polymer applications. For the year ended December
31, 2019, Industrial Specialities had revenue of £222.6 million (excluding inter-segmental revenue) and
volumes of 129.2 kilotonnes, representing 15.3% of our revenue and 8.8% of total volumes of products
sold during this period, with EBITDA of £24.8 million and Underlying operating profit of £16.0 million.
The production of acrylate monomers, reported separately as Acrylates as of January 1, 2020, is reported
and is included as a part of our Industrial Specialities segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.

`o` _Specialities: We produce polymers and speciality chemicals that are used in high performance_
markets such as the automotive sector, PVC manufacturing, construction and polymer
manufacturing. Acrylate monomers are produced for internal use in our dispersions products
operating segment, and in order to supply to certain external customers in polymer
manufacturing applications. Other applications for our specialities products include as catalysts
and flame retardants and a range of high performance coating additives. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, specialities products comprised 9% of total volumes of products sold.

We continue our commitment to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) principles and in 2019, we
commenced reporting according to Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standards. As a global leader in waterbased polymer chemistry, our purpose is to continually innovate to meet the needs of our customers and society
in a sustainable way. Our water-based products eliminate the use of over 500 kilotonnes of volatile organic
compounds (“VOC”) containing solvents. Our continuous improvement programs drive efficiency,
debottlenecking and excellence to minimize the use of resources. In addition, Synthomer launched new employee
engagement initiatives, earned a second consecutive “silver” rating from EcoVadis, established an independent
whistleblower hotline and had no reportable environmental incidents. Synthomer has achieved top quartile
occupational safety standards, with an 85% improvement in recordable injury rate from 2011 to 2019. In addition,
Synthomer showed a 56% improvement in its recordable process safety event rate from 2015 to 2019.

**OMNOVA’s Business**

OMNOVA develops, manufactures and markets emulsion polymers, speciality chemicals and decorative
products. It provides engineered surfaces for various commercial, industrial and residential end uses. During the
financial year ended November 30, 2019, OMNOVA operated two business segments: Specialty Solutions,
consisting of specialty coatings and ingredients, laminates and films and oil and gas and Performance Materials,
consisting of performance additives, paper and carpet and coated fabrics. OMNOVA derived 70% of its net sales
from the Specialty Solutions segment and 30% of its net sales from the Performance Materials segment, each for
the year ended November 30, 2019. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations for OMNOVA—Overview.”_

OMNOVA has global operations that serve more than 90 countries with operations and technology centers in
North America, Europe and Asia. Net sales from OMNOVA’s operations outside of the United States were $308.0
million or 41.8% of total net sales for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 and, $320.2 million or 41.6%
of total net sales for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $301.4 million or 38.5% for the financial
year ended November 30, 2017.

**OMNOVA Acquisition Rationale**

We believe that the Acquisition accelerates the growth potential and further differentiation of our business. We
expect to benefit from increased scale, greater customer reach and strong operational capabilities, mainly as a
result of the following factors:

**_Strong strategic fit. Our combination with OMNOVA has created a major global speciality chemicals company_**
catering to a diverse range of attractive end-sectors, with a broad range of chemistries ranging from acrylic, vinylic
and speciality emulsions polymers to SB and acrylonitrile-butadiene latexes. OMNOVA’s Specialty Solutions
business segment enables us to build on our strategy of focusing on application development, with the opportunity
to secure new long-term customer relationships through value-added solutions. The Acquisition also enhances our
global platform in speciality coatings and ingredients, increasing our exposure to attractive coatings and additives
for oil and gas drilling, cementing and stimulation end-sectors, as well as creating a major global player in water

-----

based polymer solutions.

(1)  Coatings, Adhesives and Sealants and Surface Treatment.

**_Expands and diversifies our portfolio. We believe that the majority of OMNOVA’s Specialty Solutions portfolio_**
are exposed to markets and end users with above average rates of GDP growth. The growth in these products and
markets is supported by underlying structural trends including preference for lightweight materials, rising
mobilization, and growing energy demand. The Acquisition enables us to enhance our current portfolio with
increased exposure and entry to a variety of historically attractive end-sectors, such as the oil and gas drilling,
cementing and stimulation sectors. OMNOVA is a major supplier of speciality wellbore chemicals used in
applications globally, for example, in a wide range of solutions including fluid loss control and sealing,
emulsifiers, lubricants and rheological modifiers. The sector is expected to grow due to growing energy demand
and rising well values. Following the Acquisition, we will experience greater end-sector diversification with the
ability to leverage OMNOVA’s brand recognition and technical expertise in new application areas.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s, OMNOVA’s and our combined revenue by end-market and our
combined revenue by division, in each case, for the latest respective financial years:

(1) Revenue for Synthomer for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(2) Revenue for OMNOVA for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. Using the average U.S. dollar per pound sterling exchange rate

for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1.2790 = £1.00.

(3) Our combined revenue by geographical area and end-market for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been calculated by adding the

revenue for Synthomer for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the net sales for OMNOVA for the financial year ended November

30, 2019, using the exchange rate referenced in note (2) above.

(4) Industrial Specialities inclusive of Acrylates.

**_Increased international presence in North America and Asia. The Acquisition has enhanced our position as an_**
international supplier by increasing our presence in North America, Europe and Asia. OMNOVA has a flexible
operational structure with 13 plants located principally throughout the United States, France, Portugal and China.


-----

In particular, the Acquisition materially strengthens our presence in North America, where OMNOVA derived
58% of its revenue for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. Comparatively, Synthomer generated only
5% of its revenue from North America in the financial year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the
Acquisition, we acquired eight new production facilities in North America with access to US shale gas feedstocks
and based on the combined 2019 revenue and net sales of Synthomer and OMNOVA, respectively we derived
57% of our revenue from Europe, with 20% of our revenue from North America and 23% from Asia and the rest
of the world. In addition, the Acquisition allows us to benefit from further penetration into Asia, most notably the
high growth Chinese market. OMNOVA’s manufacturing footprint in China is partly located in the Shanghai
Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP) and we expect OMNOVA’s base load business to benefit our existing Chinese
sales and technology offerings. Together, we will be able to better serve customers across three continents and
increase the geographic diversification of our portfolio.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s, OMNOVA’s and our combined revenue by geographical area (by
customer destination) for their latest respective financial years:

(1) Revenue for Synthomer for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(2) Net sales for OMNOVA for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. Using the average U.S. dollar per pound sterling exchange

rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1.2790 = £1.00.

(3) Our combined revenue by geographical area for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been calculated by adding the revenue for

Synthomer for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the net sales for OMNOVA for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 using

the exchange rate referenced in note (2) above.

**_Strong synergy potential with $29.6 million target annual run-rate pre-tax cost synergies. We expect the_**
Acquisition to result in estimated recurring run rate pre-tax cost synergies of $29.6 million per annum by the end
of the third year following completion. We believe that the Acquisition represents a significant opportunity to
deliver potential cost synergies through: (i) de-listing and head office cost savings, which are expected to account
for approximately 50% of cost synergies; (ii) operational performance improvement, R&D and procurement,
which are expected to account for approximately 30% of cost synergies; and (iii) regional and property
efficiencies, which are expected to account for approximately 20% of cost synergies. We expect approximately
50% of the annual run rate pre-tax cost synergies to be realized by the end of the first twelve-month period
following the Completion Date with approximately 75% of the annual run rate pre-tax cost synergies to be realized
by the second subsequent twelve-month period. The full annual run rate pre-tax cost synergies are expected to be
achieved by the end of the third twelve-month period. We expect that the realization of these cost synergies will
require one-off implementation costs of approximately $31.6 million (approximately £25.1 million), of which
approximately $3.6 million relates to capital expenditure. These are expected to be phased across a three-year
period.

**_Attractive financial metrics. On July 3, 2019, we announced the Acquisition for a price of $10.15 per OMNOVA_**
Share, which valued the entire issued share capital of OMNOVA at $473 million (approximately £375 million),


-----

with an implied enterprise value of $824 million (approximately £654 million). This enterprise value implies a
multiple of 9.9 times the OMNOVA Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended May 30, 2019, before the
impact of cost synergies for the Acquisition. We closed the Acquisition on April 1, 2020.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following are among our key competitive strengths:

**_Global speciality chemicals company with market leading positions across a diverse portfolio_**

We are a global speciality chemicals company and, according to Kline reports published in 2014, 2017 and 2018,
Synthomer has been one of the world’s leading suppliers of water-based polymers, with a number of its product
types holding market-leading positions in Europe, the Middle East and Malaysia. As a speciality chemicals
company, we transform basic raw materials into differentiated chemical formulations that our customers use in a
variety of downstream industries including healthcare, consumer goods and construction. The end products used
in these sectors include medical gloves, dipped latex, coated paper and carpet backing, bedding and footwear,
foams, coatings, adhesives and cement modifiers, among others. As a speciality chemicals producer, we channel
our technical expertise and customer and end market knowledge to help our customers develop these and other
end products. Our long-term customer partners benefit from our knowledge and understanding of their technical
needs, our customer service and our R&D, which has allowed us to develop innovative solutions that help their
business.

Our largest segment by both volumes and revenues is Performance Elastomers, which comprises NBR and SBR
latex products. On both a revenue and volume basis, we are the leading producer of SBR in Europe and the second
largest producer of NBR globally. We are also the leading producer of acrylic and vinylic dispersions in Europe
and the Middle East by both revenue and volume.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s market shares in the European SBR market, the Global NBR
market and the European and Middle East Dispersions markets for the year ended December 31, 2019:

**No.1 player in European Latex** **No.2 player in Global Nitrile** **No.1 player in Europe and Middle**
**(SBR)** **(NBR)** **East Dispersions**

**_Attractive and diverse end markets with a positive outlook_**

Our diversified portfolio of products serve a wide range of geographies and end markets. The markets for each of
these product types are generally well-established, with the largest producers capturing a significant proportion
of the overall market share. We believe that our favorable position in high growth regions such as Asia and our
leading market share in growing product areas such as dispersions and NBR presents us with opportunities for
further growth. We believe we have strong relationships with our long-term customers who benefit from the
expansion of markets that have resulted from years of population growth, longer life expectancies and
urbanization.


-----

There are significant R&D requirements involved in the development of the chemical products we produce and
the end markets they serve. To develop new products, our R&D is driven largely by our ability to apply our
technical know-how, rather than on pure research, hence making it difficult for new and less-established entrants
to compete in these markets and across these product types. Moreover, our products tend to compete not on price
but on the quality of the technical service and the end value that these products provide customers. This allows us
to maintain our margins and protect against low-cost market entrants. Our new product development, technical
service and tailored solutions add value to our customers’ end products and helps differentiate us from other
chemicals companies. We anticipate market trends and customer requirements which enables us to deliver
improved products with better margins and differentiation.

Our global geographic footprint, as enhanced by the Acquisition, provides us with exposure to both developed
and emerging markets, with no single country accounting for more than 17.1% of Synthomer’s revenues by
destination for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our products have applications across a diverse
range of end markets such as construction, health and protection, paper, specialities, carpet and foam and
functional polymers such as adhesives and textiles. We have well-established technical and market know-how
relating to our end markets, which support our commercial offering.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s revenue by product destination and by end market for the year
ended December 31, 2019:

We believe our presence in the end markets for each of our segments is supported by favorable market dynamics.
Our diversified and customer-focused approach enables us to address changing conditions in the end markets of
each of our product types:

- _Performance Elastomers—NBR: The demand for NBR products has been characterized by high growth_
rates in excess of 8% per annum over the past ten years and in line with industry forecasts and the growing
use of hygiene related products we expect this growth to continue in the near future. This growth has
been driven by an increase in demand for disposable gloves as well as a shift towards NBR latex as an
alternative to natural rubber, particularly in light of growing awareness of natural rubber allergies, and
PVC alternatives. This growth in the market has been supported by investment in new low cost capacity,
efficient capacity utilization, innovation and significant intellectual property development. The majority
of our NBR production capacity is strategically located in Malaysia in close proximity to the majority of
the customers of our NBR products, who are mainly manufacturers of disposable gloves and are primarily
concentrated in Southeast Asia. We are also closely integrated with key raw material suppliers to ensure
optionality and security of our raw material supply. Challenges in the NBR market have included ongoing
technical challenges to reduce glove weight and improve product performance properties and increase
availability of new generation products. We have responded to these market dynamics through significant
R&D investment to drive innovation of market-leading products with strong intellectual property
protection. We have also invested in, and continue to invest in, expanding our manufacturing capacity,
including at our Pasir Gudang manufacturing site in Malaysia, to support market growth. As with our
SBR manufacturing facilities, we have focused on driving efficiency and debottlenecking in order to
obtain lower unit manufacturing costs.

- _Performance Elastomers—SBR: The demand for SBR products typically grows in line with GDP. In_
recent years, the product type has seen growth in the construction, packaging and nonwoven end markets,
offsetting the decline in the graphic paper market as customers move to electronic media. The strong


-----

cashflow generated in this business is in part derived by leveraging our advanced manufacturing
technology across our existing manufacturing network while driving efficiency and debottlenecking our
operations in order to minimize unit manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing facilities tend to be located
close to our core customer base in Europe to support logistical requirements and we work closely with
our key raw material suppliers to ensure the security of our raw material supply. In response to the decline
in certain end markets for SBR products, we have focused our business development on high value end
markets such as foam, oil fields and batteries to further diversify our end market exposure. In addition,
we have converted SBR capacity to produce NBR for the fast-growing medical glove market to satisfy
demand and ensure the efficiency of our manufacturing network. Our acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf
in January 2018 capitalized on the opportunity for growth in the packaging and cardboard end market.

- _Functional Solutions—Dispersions: The market for dispersions products has experienced attractive_
industry growth. For example, from 2017 to 2022, the market for dispersions products in Europe is
expected to experience industry growth at a rate in excess of GDP growth, according to a 2018 Kline
report. This growth is underpinned by demographic changes such as population growth, urbanization
and an ageing population as well as the impact of an increasing global focus on energy conservation and
green products. Environmental regulations have been driving a shift from dispersions products that result
in high level of volatile organic compounds, some of which can have harmful effects from a health and
wider environmental impact perspective, towards water-based polymer solutions. The dispersions sector
is characterized by a fragmented competitive landscape in Europe. However, we have been able to
respond to the sector dynamics by leveraging our market-leading technology and well-established
presence through in-house development and strategic acquisitions to develop a broad technology base to
facilitate the manufacture of products with applications in high growth markets. Functional Solutions has
a broader geographical reach than either SBR or NBR, where our activities are concentrated in Europe
and Southeast Asia, respectively, and is a focal point for our R&D to add value to the formulation of our
customers’ products. We have invested significantly in R&D expenditure in order to provide tailored
solutions to our customers and develop innovative water-based products that respond to regulatory
drivers and customer demand.

- _Industrial Specialities: The specialities products’ markets for polymers and speciality chemicals have_
experienced solid industry growth. From 2017 to 2022, the markets for polymers and speciality chemicals
in Europe are expected to grow at a rate in excess of GDP, according to a 2018 Kline report. Specialities
are utilized in high-performance end markets such as the automotive sector, PVC manufacturing,
construction and polymer manufacturing. This sector is characterized by innovation and the development
of bespoke solutions for customers with products specified for particular uses. We have a highly
diversified technology base for speciality products serving a range of high performance application
segments. Our specialities products are used as key formulating components of products in our chosen
core markets, which allows us to cross-sell our specialities products to customers of other products. For
example, core products from our Speciality Additives business are used to enhance the performance of
decorative and industrial paints, which is one of the core end markets served by our dispersions business.
The production of acrylate monomers, both for internal use in our European Functional Solutions
operating segment and for sale to certain external customers for their polymer manufacturing
applications, is reported and is included as a part of the Synthomer Industrial Specialities segment for
the year ended December 31, 2019. Our long-standing customer relationships enable us to develop
bespoke solutions for our customers, which further reinforces these relationships.

**_Blue-chip customer base with long-term established relationships and high barriers to entry_**

Synthomer served approximately 4,300 customers across the world in the year ended December 31, 2019,
including many global blue-chip companies. On a combined basis we served approximately 6,000 customers over
the same period. We believe we have strong and long-term customer relationships, with an average length of 12
years. Our customer base is widespread and well-balanced across geographies and end markets. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer’s largest customer represented approximately 2% of total revenues while
revenues from Synthomer’s twenty largest customers represented 17% of total revenues. On a combined basis for
the same period, our largest customer contributed to 1.5% of our total sales and our largest twenty customers
contributed approximately 20% of our total sales.


-----

**_Well-invested asset base using best practice SHE, manufacturing and fixed cost management_**

We have a global manufacturing footprint utilizing state-of-the-art technology underpinned by our long-term
investment program in strategic sites. We have production facilities across Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle
East and North America, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, France,
Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
Given that many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content, transportation
and storage of these products can be costly due to the size and weight of water-based products as well as the
hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals. We therefore benefit from our wide-reaching asset base
being located in close proximity to many of our customers.

Our wide-reaching asset base provides us with flexibility of production enabling us to optimize production across
our facilities, such as transferring products from one plant to another to better match customer needs, without the
need to invest in significant capital expenditure. In recent years we have invested capital expenditure into growth
projects intended to expand and enhance our production capabilities and make our processes more efficient. The
growth capital expenditure we invest to expand our onsite capabilities tends to be spread over the same cost base
as our existing capacity, therefore improving cost efficiency by reducing overall cost per tonne.

As part of our “Project Excellence” approach, we aim to ensure all projects are completed safely, on time and
within budget. We focus on ensuring best practice in safety, health and environment (“SHE”) while delivering
high capacity utilization to drive efficiency. Our aim is to drive profitability through maximum utilization of our
assets. This involves identifying the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. For
example, we have undertaken a phased debottlenecking process at our Marl facility in Germany, where we operate
some of the largest batch reactors in the industry, to increase production of products for the foam end market. In
2019, Synthomer achieved an important milestone in our SHE practices by recording the first year with no
reportable environmental incidents.

We utilize a diversified supplier base of major blue-chip chemical companies—Synthomer’s ten largest suppliers
accounted for 50% of our raw material expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2019, with our largest single
supplier accounting for 10% of our spend on raw materials. The supplier base has widened in recent years, as our
expanded procurement team has improved security of supply and cost-effectiveness by developing links with a
wider number of raw material suppliers, which has proven beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer focused R&D_**

We have an impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer-focused R&D
which supports our strong cash profile. Synthomer maintains four R&D centers including a state-of-the-art U.K.
Innovation Centre, as well as R&D centers in Malaysia, Germany, and the United States. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer invested £16.6 million in R&D and launched 16 new products. These investments
in R&D continue to have a significant effect on Synthomer’s revenues, with 22% of Synthomer’s sales volume
for the year ended December 31, 2019 derived from products that Synthomer developed in the previous five years.
Since 2016, Synthomer has registered 12 new patents. We are committed to quantifying, improving and
communicating the sustainability of all our activities through GRI reporting.

**_Raw material and customer contracts support sustainable and stable margins_**

The speciality nature of our products means that product pricing is based on the value of these products to
customers and the technical service we provide. As a result, we are able to structure our customer agreements in
order to be able to generally pass through increases or decreases in the prices of raw materials. The favorable
structure of our customer agreements limits the impact of raw material cost volatility. For example, in 2017
butadiene prices fluctuated without having a significant impact on our margins due to the structure of our customer
agreements. Approximately one third of Synthomer’s customer agreements, measured by the volume of raw
materials being purchased, are based on agreements which are formulaic, with price-indexed clauses and/or ICISrelated pricing, and therefore allow us to transfer increases in the prices of raw materials to customers, generally
with a one-month time lag, via pass-through provisions. The remainder of Synthomer’s customer agreements are
generally negotiable on a monthly basis.


-----

We monitor global trends, including demographic and political and economic trends, as well as market
developments to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs. We aim to design our chemical formulations to ensure
they not only meet the requirements of our customers but also those of the end users of our customers’ products.
Our technical services teams work with our customers to ensure we provide the right formulation for their needs.

Furthermore, the technical and service attributes of our speciality chemicals products helps mitigate the chance
that our end customers may substitute our products for those produced by our competitors. The importance of
R&D to our products means that our customers may face high costs of substitution of our products. The underlying
investment costs for setting up manufacturing facilities and developing the technical know-how limits new
entrants in the market from being able to compete with our established business.

**_High cash conversion underpinned by low capital expenditure_**

We have a track record of profitable growth and free cash flow generation. Our product portfolio has evolved to
include more differentiated and speciality products that attract higher margins with higher barriers to substitution.
Our “Project Excellence” approach to operational excellence as well as improvements in our procurement strategy
have also helped drive higher volumes of products with higher margins. As described above, we generally have
the ability to pass through movements in the price of raw materials, with a one-month time lag, to our customers,
which enables us to maintain stable unit margins above raw material prices. We maintain fixed cost discipline by
reducing costs through finding efficiencies in existing plants.

We have low levels of maintenance capital expenditure, at approximately £30 million to £35 million per annum,
and our discretionary growth capital expenditure is flexible. We have a well-invested asset base and expect our
expansionary capital expenditure requirements to decrease over the course of the next two to three years as we
complete our ongoing major investment programs, which we expect will further support future cash flow. We
manage our working capital requirements to maintain broadly stable net working capital as a percentage of sales,
at approximately 10%.

**_Well established conservative capital policy including disciplined approach to acquisitions_**

We aim to maintain a conservative and sustainable capital management strategy with clear policies with respect
to our balance sheet leverage, and investments and shareholder returns in order to maintain an efficient and flexible
capital structure over a longer term. We intend to maintain leverage on an ongoing basis of approximately one to
two times our EBITDA, which we view as sustainable. We take a disciplined approach to investment opportunities
including mergers and acquisitions and growth capital expenditure. See “—Our Strategy—Business Growth
_Through Acquisitions.”_

As a public company, we are also aware of our shareholder returns, and have historically maintained a dividend
policy of an ordinary dividend covered 2.5 times by underlying earnings per share. However, as a consequence of
the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to freeze the final dividend payment for the year ended 2019 in the amount
of approximately £30 million.

**_Experienced management team with impressive track record_**

We benefit from a strong and experienced senior management team with significant experience in the chemicals
industry. We have made significant achievements since the appointment of our chief executive officer Calum
MacLean and chief financial officer Steve Bennett in 2015, including EBITDA growth with a CAGR of 9% from
the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2019 and strong cash flow performance. Mr.
MacLean and Mr. Bennett joined Synthomer from INEOS, where they both held leadership positions and
delivered on high profile cost reduction initiatives and successful acquisitions. Mr. MacLean and Mr. Bennett
have driven material improvement in our SHE performance and operational management as well as improvements
in our supply chain. Under Mr. MacLean and Mr. Bennett’s leadership, we undertook the largest capital
investment program in our history to maintain, upgrade and debottleneck our current asset base and respond to
market demand for our products. Our management team also has an excellent track record of integrating acquired
businesses and extracting synergies, as reflected by the successful integration of the Performance Adhesives and
Coatings business of Hexion Inc. (“PAC”). We are investing further in our management team through our
“Manufacturing Excellence” project, improvements in our commercial, human resources and IT functions as well
as expanding our procurement team to improve security of supply and cost effectiveness of our supply chain.


-----

Following the Acquisition, we retained Mr. Marshall Moore to serve as our Chief Technology Officer. Mr. Moore
has extensive experience in a range of leadership roles at OMNOVA and GE Plastics.

**Our Strategy**

Our growth strategy is driven by global megatrends and we are focused on driving sustainable growth through
business efficiency, R&D and capital investment projects. Our management team has a clear strategy for growth
through acquisitions and has historically been successful in executing merger and acquisitions (“M&A”)
transactions. We continue to assess both bolt-on and transformational opportunities while continuing to grow the
business organically.

Our strategy is composed of the following key pillars:

**_Utilize research and development and technical expertise to exploit new markets_**

We monitor global trends, including demographic, political and economic trends, as well as market developments
to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs and deliver improved products with improved margin and product
differentiation.

We seek to anticipate market trends and customer requirements to deliver improved products in growth markets
which offer improved margins and product differentiation. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 22% of
Synthomer’s sales volumes derived from products that were launched in the previous five years. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer launched 16 new products across multiple application areas and received further
market approval and commercialization of the patented SyNovus® next generation Nitrile latex product.

We view R&D and customer-focused innovation as a critical part of our business strategy. In 2018, the Board
approved an investment in a new state-of-the-art innovation center in Malaysia to add capacity and capability to
enhance our innovation in a lower cost and high-growth region of our network.

**_Drive efficiency and excellence through operations_**

We are focused on continuous improvement across our operations to advance production efficiency, sales
effectiveness and functional excellence while remaining committed to our sustainability standards.

To achieve these aims, we seek to identify good practice in all areas of the business and ensure that relevant
learnings are disseminated across the business.

In 2018, we completed the roll out of our global customer relationship management system and made progress in
strategic procurement initiatives, securing additional tankage to enhance our supply chain resilience, mitigate risk
and further benefit from the procurement of raw materials.

In 2019, we saw the benefit of our strategic procurement initiatives as we built supply chain resilience across our
network. These initiatives allowed us to manage the impact of low water levels in the Rhein in Central Europe
without disruption, manage the introduction of our new 90 kilotonne Nitrile facility in Pasir Gudang and benefit
from added flexibility in our procurement processes through more attractive purchasing contracts. For a limited
number of strategic raw materials, storage tankage was secured in order to provide procurement flexibility on
purchased quantities and maximize the number of suppliers who can be utilized. Over the last several years, our
sustainability committee has worked hard to improve our ESG credentials while remaining committed to driving
efficiency. As a result, we are a world leading supplier of sustainable water-based polymers where we have been
able to decrease the use of VOC containing based products. We have also become a global innovator in driving
the use of water-based technology, with 22% of Synthomer’s sales volume in 2019 coming from products that are
less than five years old.

**_Maximize asset utilization_**

We aim to drive profitability through maximizing the utilization of our assets. To achieve this, we focus on
identifying the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. In 2018, we identified and
eliminated a bottleneck in our site in Marl (Germany) to increase the production of high solids SBR for foam latex
applications. We also completed the disposal of the Leuna site in Germany and commenced restructuring of the


-----

Ribécourt (France), Kluang (Malaysia) and Sokolov (Czech Republic) sites as part of the development of our
manufacturing network.

**_Investment in capacity_**

As part of our focus on organic growth, we seek to add capacity in growth markets where investment opportunities
meet our stringent capital management policies. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the expansion of our
90 kilotonne Nitrile latex capacity plant at Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) on time and on budget. In 2019 we added
new capacity in our Functional Solutions business by increasing capacity in our Worms (Germany) and Roebuck
(USA) dispersions facilities. We also completed capacity and capability expansions at our foam SBR plant in
Marl (Germany) and powder coatings in Sant’Albano (Italy).

**_Business growth through acquisitions_**

Our strategic plan involves opportunistic M&A to grow the business. We are highly active in targeting and
reviewing speciality chemicals acquisition opportunities, through both bolt-on acquisitions and more
transformational step-change strategic transactions in adjacent chemistries and geographies, such as the recently
completed Acquisition. Our management is targeting the completion of potentially one or more bolt-on
transactions every year, which we believe will complement and strengthen our existing businesses in a relatively
low-risk and high-return manner. We may also make acquisitions to further diversify our product range such as
our acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf, which is primarily focused on the packaging paper end market. Our
acquisition strategy focuses on targets with a strong technical support function, R&D capabilities, strong market
positions and well-invested, advanced technology production assets, as well as robust speciality unit EBITDA
margins.

Our portfolio is well-positioned to grow through M&A, given our resilient cost base, growth pipeline, and our
experience integrating bolt-on acquisitions. Our M&A activity is supported by our strong balance sheet and further
equity as required. In the last four years, we made three speciality chemical company acquisitions, all bolt-on
acquisitions, complementing our existing businesses. These included the acquisitions of BASF Pischelsdorf in
January 2018, Perstorp Oxo Belgium AB, a specialities chemicals company (“Speciality Additives”) in March
2017 and PAC in June 2016. The acquisition of PAC, which is fully integrated in our business, enhanced our
dispersions capabilities and we delivered $12 million in run-rate synergy cost savings by the end of 2018, as well
as an additional $2 million in 2019. Integration of acquired assets is critical to our business and is an important
focus for our management as we execute our inorganic growth strategy. On July 3, 2019, we announced that we
had entered into an agreement to acquire the highly complementary OMNOVA Solutions Inc. We closed the
Acquisition on April 1, 2020. This acquisition extends our geographic reach, expands the global platform and
allows further differentiation of the business. As a result of the Acquisition, we expect recurring run rate pre-tax
cost synergies of $29.6 million per annum by the end of the third year following completion.

From time to time, we also consider opportunistic investments in larger speciality chemicals companies. However,
the delivery of any such potential acquisitions would be subject to the acquisitions being aligned with our business
strategy and enhancing the overall value of our business. During the periods under review presented in this
Offering Memorandum, management has actively pursued acquisitions in the market and, in addition to those
acquisitions that have been completed, has considered several potential acquisitions which it has decided not to
pursue as a result of valuation differences and due diligence findings.

**Recent Developments**

**COVID-19**

The outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of
quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, and the related impact from closure of supply
chains, customers and associated reduction in consumer demand have, and may continue to have, an impact on
our performance. This is expected to include an adverse effect from reduced global economic activity and resulting
demand for our customers’ products and, therefore, the products we manufacture. It may also adversely affect our
ability to operate our business, including potential disruptions to our supply chain and workforce. The COVID19 impact on capital markets could also impact our cost of borrowing.

For more information regarding the risks and associated uncertainties related to COVID-19 and its effect on our
business and results of operations, see “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to our Business and Industry—The outbreak
_of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our sales and operations.”_

We continue to operate 38 global manufacturing sites, with speciality chemicals designated as key industrial assets
in each of the geographies in which we operate. The only manufacturing site that experienced disruptions as a
direct result of a known case of COVID-19 was our joint-venture facility in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, where a
workforce infection temporarily suspended production. Two small dispersion facilities were closed by a
mandatory control order in Malaysia in March 2020 and April 2020. All of our sites are now operational. Issues
with regards to raw material supply, the distribution of finished goods and the availability of operating personnel
have been managed and will continue to be monitored, although weaker product demand has led to most sites
operating at reduced levels.

In order to protect our workforce and maintain the continuance of our operations, we implemented several
preventative measures including the use of social distancing in the workplace, the division of management teams,
the use of rotations and, where an infection is suspected, mandatory isolation. Partially due to the success of these
measures, we have been able to manage our supply chain and employee absenteeism, with minimal disruption to
our operations.

We have acted proactively and prudently in a number of ways to anticipate the more challenging market conditions
including:

- The Board’s March 2020 decision not to recommend the payment of a final dividend for the year ended
December 31, 2019, saving Synthomer approximately £30 million of cash that would have been paid to
shareholders in early July 2020.

- The decision of the Board, executive management and senior management to freeze their respective pay
at 2019 levels and delay any further review until October 2020.

- Planned reduction of our capital expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2020 to approximately
£50 million, from a combined capital expenditure of approximately £90 million for the Enlarged Group
in 2019. We recently completed a material capital expenditure program and our asset base remains well
invested.

- Announced a commitment to deleverage to below 2.0x net debt/EBITDA by the end of the second year
following the Acquisition in line with our policy to target a leverage range of between 1x net
debt/EBITDA and 2x net debt/EBITDA.

All these actions were taken proactively ahead of an expected period of more challenging trading activity. The
Board believes that these are appropriate and prudent measures to take as it seeks to preserve our strong liquidity,
cash flow and financial position through uncertain times.

**_Trading Update_**

In April 2020 and May 2020, the first two months of trading as a combined group following the Acquisition, our
sales volumes were impacted by COVID-19. While Nitrile latex, nonwovens and adhesives demand remained
strong, sales into industrial markets, including the automotive, coatings, graphic paper, carpet and oil & gas sectors


-----

were impacted significantly by COVID-19 in all major geographies. Sales volumes over the period declined by
approximately 20% compared to a strong pro _forma comparative period in 2019, with sales volumes strengthening_
towards the end of May. Our unaudited results in April 2020 and May 2020 differed across our business segments.

- _Performance Elastomers: NBR continued to benefit from the additional 90 kilotonnes of capacity_
introduced in the fourth quarter of 2018 at our Pasir Gudang facility. In addition, we saw increased
demand as a result of COVID-19 leading to higher Nitrile sales volumes. Although strengthening over
the course of the period due to lower raw material costs, unit gross margins were marginally lower
relative to a strong pro forma comparative period in 2019. SBR market conditions were significantly
impacted due to weaker demand, with both volumes and unit gross margins decreasing as a result of
lower demand in the paper, carpet and foam end markets. We are undertaking an ongoing review of our
European SBR network, and further updates will be provided once an appropriate course of action has
been determined.

- _Functional Solutions: Sales volumes were lower in all industrial segments as compared to a strong pro_
_forma comparative period in 2019. However, the reduction in sales volumes was partially offset by_
stronger unit gross margins as a result of an improved product mix and softer raw material markets. The
expansion of our Worms, Germany and Roebuck, USA dispersions facilities as well as the Acquisition
of OMNOVA have introduced low cost capacity to drive organic growth in differentiated applications.

- _Industrial Specialities: Our sales volumes were lower in all industrial segments when compared to a_
strong pro forma comparative period in 2019. Unit gross margins remained in line with 2019.

- _Acrylates: Following the acquisition of OMNOVA, we reassessed how our business would be managed_
going forward. A new management structure was implemented, and in order to provide additional focus,
the acrylate monomers, which was previously incorporated in Industrial Specialities, was identified as a
separate segment. In April 2020 and May 2020, sales volumes and margins were lower compared to the
_pro forma comparative 2019 period on lower end market demand._

The integration of OMNOVA is progressing in line with our expectations. The business is now operating within
the existing Synthomer businesses. The previously reported expected synergies of $29.6 million, with a 50% run
rate at the end of twelve months, is on track with no delays in synergy delivery expected due to COVID-19.

The unaudited preliminary financial results for the periods presented above are derived from our accounting
records and are the responsibility of our management. This information has not been audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled, nor have any agreed-upon procedures been applied by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent
auditors, with respect thereto. Accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP do not express an opinion or any other
form for assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reports included in this Offering
Memorandum relate to Synthomer’s previously issued consolidated financial statements. It does not extend to the
unaudited preliminary financial results for the periods presented above and should not be read to do so. You should

results are based upon a number of assumptions and judgments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and are
subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for
the periods presented. Although we believe the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial
information and the assumptions on which they are based to be reasonable, our preliminary financial results are
subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for
the months ended April 30, 2020 and May 31, 2020.

Solutions Inc. was spun-off from GenCorp as an independent, publicly traded corporation. On July 3, 2019 we announced the acquisition

of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. for a price of $10.15 per share, representing an enterprise value of $824 million (£654 million). The cash

price valued the entire issued share capital of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. at $473 million as at July 3, 2019. The Acquisition closed on

were £0 million. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a

bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, the non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders

of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks

_Relating to the Notes and Guarantees—The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other_

_obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

(9) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is party to certain joint ventures and holds a minority stake in certain entities.

_has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS and the unaudited consolidated interim financial_
_statements of Synthomer as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with IAS_
_34, appearing elsewhere herein._

_In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering_
_Memorandum has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of OMNOVA as of November_
_30, 2018 and 2019 and for each of the financial years ended November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 prepared in_
_accordance with US GAAP and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of as of and for the three_
_months ended February 29, 2020 OMNOVA prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial_
_statement._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements have been prepared giving effect to the_
_Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Balance Sheet has been prepared giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March_
_31, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is based on available_
_information and various assumptions that management believe to be reasonable. The Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Financial Information includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are factually_
_supportable and directly attributable to the Transactions. In addition, with respect to the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Income Statements, the unaudited pro forma adjustments are expected to have a continuing_
_impact on the consolidated income statements of Synthomer._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is prepared, unless otherwise specified,_
_on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of Synthomer consolidated_
_financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The OMNOVA consolidated financial_
_statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The unaudited pro forma financial information relating_
_to OMNOVA reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been derived_
_through unaudited pro forma adjustments from the OMNOVA consolidated financial statements prepared in_
_accordance with US GAAP and adjusted, as applicable, to IFRS and the accounting policies as applied by_
_Synthomer._

_We have assessed the OMNOVA financial information to identify any material differences between IFRS and US_
_GAAP. Unaudited pro forma adjustments from this assessment are presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Financial Information; however, we have not attempted to quantify all differences that_
_would have been identified if the historical OMNOVA financial information had been prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the adjustments described in the notes to the Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information are a complete summary of all the differences that would_
_result had a full IFRS conversion been prepared. Had such a conversion been made, other accounting and_
_disclosure differences may have come to our attention that are not identified in the notes to the Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information, some of which may be material._


-----

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been prepared on the basis that the_
_Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to IFRS, which requires_
_the recognition and measurement of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value as_
_of the date control is obtained and the purchase price. The purchase accounting adjustments to record the assets_
_and liabilities at fair value have not yet been finalized. The fair value adjustments, when finalized, may be_
_material._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been adjusted to reflect any_
_matters not directly attributable to implementing the Transactions. No adjustment, therefore, has been made for_
_any of the integration plans related to the Acquisition._

_The actual financial results may differ materially from those reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Financial Information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the_
_assumptions used to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and actual_
_amounts. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is provided for illustrative_
_purposes and as supplemental information to facilitate management discussion and analysis and does not purport_
_to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred_
_on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial_
_position at any future date._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented in millions of pounds_
_sterling. Accordingly, OMNOVA financial data has been converted from U.S. dollars to pounds sterling at the_
_rates (source: Oanda.com) for the relevant periods as disclosed below:_

**Pounds sterling**

**Period** **to U.S. dollars**

Average rate for the year ended November 30, 2019 ............................................................................ 1.2746
Rate as of February 29, 2020 ................................................................................................................. 1.2823
Average rate for the three months ended February 29, 2020 ................................................................. 1.3015

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information set forth in this Offering Memorandum_
_is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may_
_differ materially from the actual amounts that would have been achieved had the Transactions occurred on the_
_respective dates mentioned above._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information does not include all information required_
_for financial statements under IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the Synthomer Consolidated_
_Financial Statements and OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance_
_with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any generally_
_accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting_
_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in accordance_
_with any generally accepted audited standards. Any information you place on this information should fully take_
_this into consideration._

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION FOR SYNTHOMER**

_The following tables present our summary historical financial information as of and for each of the three years_
_ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and as of March 31, 2020 and for each of the three months ended_
_March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, as well as certain_
_unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and unaudited as adjusted combined pro forma_
_information for the Enlarged Group for periods presented below._

_The summary historical financial data as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019_
_has been derived from the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited summary financial data as_
_of March 31, 2020 and for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 have been derived_
_from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance_
_with IAS 34 and are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Interim results are not necessarily_
_reflective of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or the full year._

_The Synthomer unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been calculated_
_by subtracting Synthomer’s unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived_
_from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) from Synthomer’s results of_
_operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 (derived from the Synthomer Consolidated Financial_
_Statements) and then adding Synthomer’s unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31,_
_2020 (derived from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). The unaudited_
_financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes_
_only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial_
_condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting._

_During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain accounting standards_
_that may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the_
_adoption of IFRS 16—Leases, IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9—Financial_
_Instruments. As a result, our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum_
_may not be directly comparable between periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”_

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum_
_has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS and the unaudited consolidated interim financial_
_statements of Synthomer as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with IAS_
_34, appearing elsewhere herein. In addition, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial_
_Information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from the audited consolidated financial_
_statements of OMNOVA as of November 30, 2018 and 2019 and for each of the financial years ended November_
_30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the unaudited consolidated interim financial_
_statements of as of and for the three months ended February 29, 2020 OMNOVA prepared in accordance with US_
_GAAP for interim financial statement. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data – Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Financial Information” for a description of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Financial Information and the notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial_
_Information for a description of all unaudited pro forma adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Financial Information._

_The Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has_
_been calculated by adding the 2019 Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement and the_
_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Interim Income Statement, and then subtracting Synthomer’s_
_unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived from the Synthomer Interim_
_Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IAS 34) and the unaudited results of operations_
_of OMNOVA for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial statements). This Unaudited_
_As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 included in this_
_Offering Memorandum has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Synthomer’s management._
_PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon_

_accordingly, do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. See “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Data—Unaudited As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the Enlarged Group.”_

_This section includes certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS_
_because we believe they provide investors with useful additional information to measure our performance,_
_liquidity or capital expenditures. These non-IFRS financial measures have important limitations as analytical_
_tools. We believe that these non-IFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our_
_indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You_
_should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other_
_companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in_
_isolation. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures For Synthomer,” “Presentation_
_of Financial Other Data – Non IFRS Financial Measures for the Enlarged Group.”_

(4) We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items. See “Presentation of Financial and Other

_Data” for the definition of Special Item. We believe that EBITDA provides useful information to investors about our results of operations_

because it is among the measures used by our Board and management to evaluate our Underlying operating performance, review business

trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions, and it allows a comparison of our results across

periods on a consistent basis by removing the effects on our operating performance of our capital structure (such as the varying levels

of interest expense), asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and items largely outside the control

of management (such as income taxes). In addition, you should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this

presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Our presentation of EBITDA should

not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or irregular items. EBITDA should not be considered

in isolation or as a substitute for measures of our operating performance in accordance with IFRS. The Underlying performance measures,

including EBITDA, provide additional information in line with how financial performance is measured by management and reported to

the Board. We believe that these non-IFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can

assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You should exercise caution in comparing the non
IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool,

and you should not consider them in isolation. For example, with respect to EBITDA, some of these limitations include the following:

(i) it does not reflect our capital expenditures, our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) it does

not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) it does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash

requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non
cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any

cash requirements that would be required for such replacements.

The following table reconciles EBITDA from operating profit-IFRS for the periods indicated.

and US GAAP in relation to the OMNOVA’s historical financial information for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived

from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP), as we have made for the
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Unaudited Pro
_Forma_ Condensed Combined Financial Information for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as described and presented
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
(b) EBITDA for OMNOVA for the three months ended February 28, 2019 of $9.0 million, converted using the average exchange rate
for the three months ended February 29, 2020 of £1.00 = $1.3049.
(c) Estimated recurring run rate pre-tax cost synergies of $29.6 million, converted using the average exchange rate for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2020 of £1.00 = $1.2707, which we expect to benefit from by the end of the third year following
completion of the Acquisition.

This unaudited as adjusted run-rate pro _forma EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been prepared by, and is the_

responsibility of management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed-upon

procedures with respect to the accompanying unaudited as adjusted run-rate pro _forma EBITDA, and, accordingly, do not express an_

opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reports included in this Offering

Memorandum relate to Synthomer’s previously issued consolidated financial statements. It does not extend to the Unaudited As Adjusted

Combined Pro Forma Information and should not be read to do so. The unaudited as adjusted run-rate pro _forma EBITDA has been_

period or our financial condition at any future date and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. See “—Unaudited

_As Adjusted Combined Pro Forma Information for the Enlarged Group.”_

(11) As adjusted _pro forma_ finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives

presented as Special Items) have been calculated by adding pro _forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and_

fair value of unhedged interest derivatives) for the year ended December 31, 2019 (derived from the 2019 Unaudited _Pro Forma_

Condensed Combined Income Statement) and pro _forma finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and fair value of_

unhedged interest derivatives) for the three months ended March 31, 2020 (derived from the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined

Interim Income Statement), and then subtracting Synthomer’s unaudited finance costs (excluding interest element of lease payments and

fair value of unhedged interest derivatives presented as Special Items) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived from the

Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IAS 34) and OMNOVA’s unaudited

interest expense for the three months ended February 28, 2019 (derived from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements,

prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial statements). We have not made comparable pro forma adjustments to reflect

the Acquisition and Related Financing nor the Refinancing in adjusting for the historical financial information of Synthomer and

OMNOVA for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and February 28, 2019, respectively, as we have made for the Unaudited Pro

_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Unaudited_ _Pro_ _Forma Condensed_

Combined Financial Information for the three months ended March 31, 2020 described and presented elsewhere in this Offering

Memorandum. We have not undertaken an assessment to identify, nor have we made any adjustments for, any material differences

between IFRS as adopted by Synthomer and US GAAP in relation to the OMNOVA’s historical financial information for the three

months ended February 28, 2019 (derived from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with

US GAAP), as we have made for the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for the year ended December

31, 2019 and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as described

_that may be expected for any other interim period or the full year._

_The OMNOVA unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 has been_
_calculated by subtracting OMNOVA’s results of operations for the three months ended February 28, 2019_
_(derived from the OMNOVA Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) from OMNOVA’s results of operations_

_This section includes certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with US_
_GAAP because we believe they provide investors with useful additional information to measure our performance,_
_liquidity or capital expenditures. These non-US GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical_
_tools. We believe that these non-US GAAP measures are a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our_
_indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You_
_should exercise caution in comparing the non-US GAAP measures as reported by us to non-US GAAP measures_
_of other companies. Non-US GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider_
_them in isolation. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures For OMNOVA.”_

_During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain accounting standards_
_that may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the_
_adoption of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets_
_Other Than Inventory and ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net_
_Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. As a result, our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or_
_in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of_
_such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom._
_Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the risks_
_described below and other information in this Offering Memorandum and their personal circumstances. The_
_occurrence of any of the following events could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business,_
_prospects, results of operations and financial condition and impair our ability to fulfil our obligations in respect_
_of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes._

_The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used_
_as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently deem_
_immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,_
_results of operations or financial condition._

_This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on assumptions and estimates,_
_and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the_
_forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

_Unless otherwise indicated or implied by the context, references in this section to “we,” “our” and “us” are to_
_the Enlarged Group. References to OMNOVA include references to OMNOVA as comprising part of Synthomer_
_following the Acquisition._

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The outbreak of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our sales and operations._**

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the
world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 and measures
to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces
and other businesses and the related impact from closure of supply chains, customers and associated reduction in
consumer demand have, and may continue to have, an impact on our performance.

In April 2020 and May 2020, our sales volumes across the Enlarged Group were impacted by weaker end market
demand, the closure of certain of our key customers and disruptions in certain parts of our supply chain. Certain
products experienced strong demand through the period, including demand for Nitrile latex, which was bolstered
by sales of medical gloves. During the period, the world’s largest glovemaker announced a projected 25% increase
in sales for the year. However, sales into industrial markets, including the automotive, coatings, paper, carpet and
oil & gas sectors were impacted significantly by COVID-19 in all major geographies. Sales volumes over the
period declined by approximately 20% compared to a strong comparative period in 2019. As the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the outbreak may continue to have a negative impact on our
performance. Although it is currently too early to estimate, we expect the ultimate significance of the impact of
these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be
determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the
pandemic.

The spread of COVID-19 may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic activity and may lead to a
recession or depression, which would adversely affect the demand for our customers’ products and products that
we manufacture. The spread of COVID-19 may also cause other unpredictable events, each of which would
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any future epidemics may also have
similar, or more severe, effects on global economic activity and on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Adverse and uncertain global economic conditions, including factors affecting our, our customers’ and our_**
**_suppliers’ access to credit, could negatively impact our business and ability to borrow or raise capital._**

Our business may be impacted by fluctuations in consumer demand in the end-markets where its customers
operate, the global economic environment, changes in interest rates and instability in securities markets around
the world, among other factors. Adverse economic conditions can affect consumer and business spending
generally. In particular, a worsening economic climate can result in a decreased demand in the markets in which
our products are used.

The supply-demand balance in the markets where we compete and prices for raw materials are strongly influenced
by the overall economic conditions in Europe, North America and Asia. Despite an improvement in global
economic conditions since the economic downturn in global markets in the first quarter of 2020, certain markets,
including emerging markets such as those in Asia, may not achieve in the future the growth rates that have been
observed historically. An extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or
in any of the markets in which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely
affect our business.

Similarly, a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial position, as a result of adverse economic
conditions, COVID-19 or otherwise, could increase our credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit
its ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. Continued weakness in the global economy for a
significant period of time, or a further deterioration of global economic conditions, could result in our customers
experiencing less profitability in their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty in obtaining financing, which
may ultimately lead to liquidations or bankruptcies. Any of these occurrences could cause it to limit or discontinue
business with those customers. Our suppliers may also experience similar conditions, which could impact their
ability to fulfil their obligations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Furthermore, a number of the our customers and suppliers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their
operations, which may be limited due to adverse economic conditions. The inability of our customers to access
credit facilities may adversely affect its business by reducing sales and increasing exposure to bad debt, thereby
reducing profitability. In addition, the inability of our suppliers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our
business by increasing prices for raw material and transportation, which could have an adverse effect on our
margins.

Finally, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets (including as a result of the effects of COVID-19)
could prevent us from obtaining financing or credit at favorable terms in order to fulfil our financing needs
(including the need to refinance or repay debt obligations, including the Notes). If we are unable to refinance or
repay our debt obligations or access the credit and capital markets, we may not be able to pursue certain aspects
of its business plans, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are exposed to volatility in the availability and price of the raw materials on which our business relies,_**
**_which may adversely impact our results of operations, and we may lose the ability to pass along fluctuations in_**
**_raw materials prices._**

Our margins are significantly impacted by the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our
products and the costs of the raw materials required to make these products.

The prices for certain of our raw materials, including styrene, butadiene, acrylonitrile, butyl acrylate and methyl
methacrylate, have historically been volatile. The availability and price of these raw materials are influenced by
factors over which we have limited control, such as market conditions, general global economic prospects,
production capacity, the financial stability of our suppliers, suppliers’ commitments to others and production
constraints, fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, infrastructure failures, political
conditions, weather conditions, regulations and other factors.

The prices of a majority of our raw materials by cost, such as styrene, butadiene, acrylonitrile and methyl
methacrylate are at least partially dependent on crude oil prices. Over the long term, the price of these raw
materials reflects the general trends in crude oil, which have experienced significant fluctuations. The price of


-----

Brent crude oil has experienced significant volatility since March 2020. According to Bloomberg, the average
daily spot price of Brent crude oil in 2019 was approximately $64 per barrel, a decrease from approximately $71
per barrel in 2018 but an increase from approximately $54 per barrel in 2017. However, beginning in March 2020,
there was a rapid and severe decline in global oil prices, with the price of Brent crude oil declining from $52.73
per barrel on March 2, 2020 to a low of $ 17.32 per barrel on April 21, 2020. While the price of Brent crude oil
has since stabilized somewhat, the price has not fully recovered to previous levels. The average price of Brent
crude oil was $32.98 in March 2020, $ 23.34 in April 2020 and $ 31.02 in May 2020. Over the short term, supply
and demand balances can have an even greater impact on the pricing of raw materials. Although we generally
pass on raw material price increases and decreases to customers, if the price of crude oil increases, it could result
in an increase in the prices of certain of our raw materials which we may not be able to pass on fully.

The relative scarcity of certain raw materials can impact our results. Although we generally have multiple global
raw material suppliers, certain raw materials are available only from a small number of suppliers and in limited
circumstances only from a single source. While we use a limited number of raw materials that are available only
from a single source and order those materials in limited quantities, the loss of any of these raw materials could
significantly impact our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized businesses.
Accordingly, sole source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply leverage.

In other cases, we may choose to sole source certain raw materials to obtain certain commercial advantages,
including superior pricing and terms. Any disruption in raw material availability from one of these suppliers may
require us to secure raw material supplies from alternative suppliers on less favorable terms.

Volatility in raw material prices could place strains on our working capital requirements. While we seek to pass
through fluctuations in raw material prices to our customers, there have been delays historically in our ability to
do so. Additionally, interruptions in supply could place increased pressure on our margins and reduce our net cash
flow. Either of these possibilities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations, as well as impair our ability to fulfil our financing needs (including the need to repay our obligations)
or make further investments in its business. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we do not use commodity derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of raw materials, relying
instead on our ability to pass through volatility through pricing. Since the value of our chemical products is to a
major extent determined by the raw materials that are required for the production of these products, our
profitability depends on the relationship between the sales prices for our products and the costs we incur for raw
materials. As prices for most of the raw materials we require tend to be volatile, we constantly need to adjust sales
prices, in particular in an environment of rising raw material prices, in order to maintain sufficient profitability.
In a declining price environment, demand can decline as customers postpone orders in anticipation of further price
decreases. In response to changes in demand levels, our competitors may price their products more aggressively
in order to retain market share, which can result in an adverse market environment for us in the short term until
the market reaches a new equilibrium. There may be other unforeseen effects, which we cannot predict given the
volatility of raw material prices.

**_We could be affected by the possibility of disruption in our supplier relationships, which could affect our ability_**
**_to source raw materials._**

We purchase our raw materials from a relatively limited number of sources. As a result, any disruption or delay
in the supply of those materials from a particular supplier, an inability to source raw materials of appropriate
quality, or loss of a supplier where we are unable to find a suitable alternative, may hinder our ability to fill
customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective basis or in the required quantities, which could result in order
cancellations, decreased revenue or loss of market share and damage to our reputation. Further, volatility in costs
and pricing can result in contractual disputes with suppliers or an inability to contract on mutually satisfactory
terms. Adverse resolution of any such disputes or contract negotiations could have a negative effect on our results
of operations.

COVID-19 has not had a material impact on our supplier relationships nor our ability to reliably purchase supplies.
However, the future effects of COVID-19 on supplier relationships cannot be estimated at this time and may have
a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.


-----

Certain of the principal raw materials that are used in our business are derived from petrochemicals and chemical
feedstocks, which are only available from a single source. While we use a limited number of raw materials which
are available only from a single source and order those materials in limited quantities, the loss of any of these raw
materials could significantly impact our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized
businesses. Accordingly, sole source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply
leverage.

If any of our suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply us with the raw materials required, we could experience
disruptions in production. Such disruptions could result in substantial delays if we are not able to find suitable
replacement raw materials on commercially viable terms.

We currently have two plants in China, both of which have not yet experienced any supplier disruptions related
to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, it cannot be guaranteed that this or any future events will not disrupt supply
channels in China or elsewhere.

The supply contracts for the raw materials that we acquire are typically twelve-month delivery agreements for
raw materials, the majority of which are global commodities with short lived price differences between regions
due to the logistics, cost and time to store and ship products from one region to another. As a result, while we
retain monthly flexibility to buy spot and contract volumes, our ability to influence the pricing mechanisms in our
supply agreements may be limited.

Many of our suppliers have operations that are subject to the SHE risks associated with the use of hazardous
materials. Any SHE-related incidents affecting these suppliers may result in significant regulatory actions, fines
and other penalties, including restrictions, prohibitions or sanctions on their operations. Such consequences in
turn could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us under present or future supply agreements.

The key terms of the supply contracts for the raw materials that we acquire generally include hardship clauses and
provide some flexibility to negotiate, and although we can modify such terms to better reflect current business
conditions under certain contracts, there is a risk that this flexibility will be insufficient to adapt our contracts to
prevailing business conditions, or in a way that is suitable to us, or at all. As a general matter, if a supplier is
unable to meet our obligations under present delivery agreements with us, we may be forced to incur higher costs
to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the raw
materials at all.

**_The chemicals industry, generally, and the speciality chemicals industry, to a lesser extent, is subject to_**
**_cyclicality, which may cause fluctuations in our results of operations._**

Historically, the chemicals industry, as a whole, and the speciality chemicals industry in which we operate, to a
lesser extent, have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply conditions,
followed by periods when substantial capacity was added resulting in oversupply, and our future results of
operations may continue to be affected by this cyclicality and variability.

Several factors that have historically contributed to volatile results in the chemicals industry, and in our business,
most of which are beyond our control, include:

- exchange rate fluctuations for producers with a global manufacturing footprint or distribution;

- oversupply due to unforeseen capacity expansions by existing or new competitors;

- short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned and unplanned shutdowns;

- regulatory requirements driving required technology and manufacturing changes; and

- political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key raw materials.

Uncertainty in the global economic environment (which could result in lower demand) and the implications of the
variable supply and demand balance in the chemicals industry may result in increased supply, which could
increase pressure on our margins and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Conversely, industry-wide capacity constraints, driven by strong demand or other factors, may lead


-----

to a rise in sales prices for our raw materials and therefore to a corresponding rise in the prices of our products,
which could cause our existing customers, for certain products, to switch to substitutes or to reduce the quantities
of our products they purchase, which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may be unable to implement our business strategies or fully capitalize upon investments in our production_**
**_capacity._**

Our future financial performance and success largely depend on the ability to implement our business strategies
successfully.

Our business strategies are based on assumptions about future demand for our products, the new products and
applications we are developing and on our continuing ability to produce products profitably. Each of these factors
depends on, among other things, our ability to innovate to keep up with changes in technology or the competitive
environment, operate in accordance with regulations imposed by local jurisdictions to deal with extreme
circumstances, acquire suitable targets, integrate acquired businesses, finance operations and product development
activities, maintain and expand high-quality and efficient manufacturing operations, efficiently manage our supply
chains, respond to competitive and regulatory changes, comply with competition regulations in various
jurisdictions, access quality raw materials in a cost-effective and timely manner, and retain and attract highly
skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel.

For example, our strategy of enhancing our manufacturing capacity at our existing manufacturing sites to take
advantage of growth markets is dependent on project management and poor execution of our various capacity
enhancement projects could impact our ability to deliver the capacity enhancements. Any such failure to develop,
revise or implement our business strategies in a timely and effective manner or produce and supply the product
mix that customers demand may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

In addition, we may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, the objectives and benefits of our cost
reduction initiatives. There may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing one or more of such cost reduction
initiatives, and we may not ultimately realize the full benefits of, or be able to sustain the benefits anticipated by,
these initiatives. Additionally, even if we achieve our goals, the cost of implementing these initiatives could
ultimately exceed their benefits. In addition, certain of these initiatives have resulted in a streamlined and
consolidated manufacturing capacity, which increases the risk of business interruption if a consolidated
manufacturing site experiences operational or other difficulties.

Since the economic downturn in global markets in 2008 to 2009, macroeconomic volatility has made it more
difficult to predict GDP development in many economies, resulting in frequent modifications to GDP growth
expectations published by economic research institutions, as well as in adjustments by market research specialists,
sometimes giving rise to significant revisions to growth expectations for specific markets. Furthermore, the
ongoing uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a continued adverse effect on economic and
geopolitical developments. As a result, many chemicals producers, including ourselves, may find it difficult to
accurately model and predict the prospects for our businesses, and it may be difficult for investors to use historical
financial information as an indicator for future results. Any failure by us to accurately predict the economic
environment and the development of our business could lead to misjudgments as to the level of production
capacities needed for our business, increase the risk of failed investments and may materially affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any future acquisitions may prove difficult for us to consummate and we may carry out acquisitions which_**
**_may not deliver anticipated benefits._**

Our strategy involves opportunistic acquisitions from time to time, including the Acquisition and the key
acquisitions of BASF Pischelsdorf in January 2018, Speciality Additives in March 2017 and PAC in June 2016.
We may continue to acquire companies or assets in the future if we identify appropriate acquisition targets or
divest assets to streamline our business. It is possible that we identify the targets that are not appropriate for our
business or that we pay more to acquire the target than the value are able to realize from it. Any acquisition that
we make could be subject to a number of risks, including:


-----

- problems with effective integration of operations;

- the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;

- increased operating costs;

- costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations;

- the loss of key employees of the acquired company;

- exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and

- difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.

In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, despite the due diligence we perform, we may encounter
performance, funding or cash flow issues with the acquired business or inadvertently or unknowingly acquire
actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract, employment related
claims, environmental liabilities, hazardous materials or liability for hazardous materials or tax liabilities. If any
of the above were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Further, we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which would increase our debt service requirements, or
we may use operating cash flows to finance acquisitions, which would decrease our retained earnings and the
amount of cash on our balance sheet. In order to manage any acquisitions we successfully complete, we will need
to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems.

If making acquisitions or integrating any acquired business diverts too much management attention from the
operations or our current businesses, this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Any acquisition we consummate may not ultimately provide the benefits we originally anticipated. Furthermore,
we may not succeed in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.

**_The chemicals industry, as well as the markets of certain of our customers, is characterized by significant levels_**
**_of competition, which may adversely affect our competitive position, sales and overall operations._**

We operate in highly competitive industries. We are exposed to the competitive characteristics of several different
geographic markets and industries, and our competitors are among some of the world’s largest chemical
companies. Our principal competitors vary across our product lines and range from large global chemical
companies to smaller regional companies. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, research
and technology and marketing resources, may be able to manufacture products more economically and may be
able to better withstand changes in market conditions.

In addition, if the markets for our products expand, we expect that there may be an increase in new competitors
and that existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we operate, further enhancing
existing competition. The resulting pressure of increased competition on our margins could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Furthermore, a number of our customers are participants in markets that are undergoing consolidation. We could
lose individual customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or consolidate with, other companies that have
relationships with our competitors. In addition, ongoing consolidation in various industries continues to create
individual customers with greater purchasing power and competitors with greater financial and other resources.
Customers in established markets face their own competitive pressures, particularly from businesses in regions
with lower overhead costs. Such competitive pressures may force us to reduce prices and attempt to offset such
price reductions with improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, which may not be possible.
Additionally, some competitors may be better positioned to weather prolonged periods of reduced prices, which
may incentivize them to reduce prices even when not dictated by market and competitive conditions.

**_Our operations require the use of several different currencies exposing us to the effects of exchange rate_**
**_fluctuations that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to repay indebtedness or comply with certain_**
**_maintenance covenants._**

Our business is subject to risks normally associated with international operations, including currency fluctuation
risks and local business risks. Our reporting and functional currency is the pound sterling while we generate sales,
incur costs and have assets and liabilities in other currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, euro, Malaysian ringgit,
renminbi and Thai baht. Fluctuations in the prices of any of the currencies that we use could have a material
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the absence of hedging, currency fluctuations between the pound sterling and the currencies of the various
markets in which we operate may affect our results and make it difficult to compare performance levels in those
markets from year to year. If the pound sterling appreciates (or depreciates) against another currency, the pound
sterling value of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses initially recognized in that other currency will decline
(or increase). To partially offset this exposure, we will utilize cash flows that arise in a given currency to pay for
expenses arising in the same currency wherever possible, and we may also engage in certain limited hedging
transactions. However, there can be no assurance that these strategies will be sufficient to effectively limit the
increased impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations.

Our international subsidiaries typically report in local currencies rather than in pound sterling. Profit translation
exposures from overseas operations are not hedged. As a result, strengthening of the pound sterling against the
euro, U.S. dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result in a decrease in our revenue as reported in pound sterling, which
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, local
subsidiaries may incur costs in, and generate income in, currencies other than their respective reporting currencies,
exposing them to foreign currency transaction risk. Moreover, a significant proportion of our assets, as well as the
majority of our liabilities, are also in currencies other than pound sterling, and assets and liabilities are translated
into pound sterling at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date for inclusion in our consolidated
financial statements.

In addition, a significant proportion of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the pound
sterling. As a result, to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the currency in which capital
expenditure is to be incurred and we do not have sufficient cash flows in the respective currency to make such
capital expenditure, the effective cost of making such capital expenditure may be higher.

We evaluate exchange rate risks from time to time and uses borrowings in local currencies to hedge overseas net
assets. We do not hedge profit translation exposure. Our foreign currency hedging strategies may not adequately
protect our results of operations or balance sheet position from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, which
may result in losses or may limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in
exchange rates. Any significant adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Conducting operations and sales in several different countries exposes us, and our facilities to various_**
**_macroeconomic and regulatory risks within each jurisdiction._**

We sell and market our products in the U.K., Europe, North America, Asia (including China), and to a lesser
extent, other parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East, and currently have active manufacturing
facilities located in a number of locations, including the U.K., the United States, Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain,
France, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. We employ sales staff and agents strategically located around the world to serve our global customer base.
Our business is therefore subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements
and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include exposure to the
following:

- unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions;

- adverse changes in the general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we
operate;


-----

- difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights;

- compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions becoming burdensome;

- increasing transportation and other shipping costs, delays or interruptions;

- variations in business practices;

- the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other
restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;

- instability and disruptions caused by actual or threatened export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties
in obtaining export licenses;

- staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

- the threat of government expropriation;

- region to region fluctuations in key raw material costs;

- difficulties in staffing and managing operations

- the imposition of any price controls or anti-dumping rulings;

- litigation risk and possible loss contingencies arising from COVID-19 and its adverse effects, including
commercial contract disputes, employee matters, contract counterparty insolvency, force majeure,
insurance claims and other arrangements;

- the imposition of government restrictions on movement or gatherings; and

- difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables.

The occurrence of any of the above could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We have operations in developing countries such as Malaysia, and we may expand our business and operations
into other high-growth emerging markets, including other parts of Asia. Our operations in developing countries
are subject to the risks inherent in operating in developing countries, including legal and regulatory uncertainties
(such as difficulties in securing intellectual property rights), political instability or conflict, as well as rapid
changes in economic or political conditions in emerging markets, which may result in greater risks of inflation,
fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, and a negative impact on the demand for our products.

As a result of our global operations, we are subject to laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. These
include trade laws, competition and antitrust laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption
and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to anti-corruption laws and
regulations such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other international
laws and regulations. Failure to control, for example, anti-competitive behavior, bribery and corruption, or
breaches of trade sanctions could result in substantial penalties, including civil and criminal liabilities, as well as
damage to our reputation. Our international operations could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or
other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations, including the United
Nations, the European Union and their member countries.

From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures have engaged in limited sales to countries subject
to such sanctions laws, including Iran and Syria. Such sales to Iran and Syria represented an insignificant amount
of our total revenues sales in 2018. We believe the sale of our products in Iran and Syria does not violate applicable
U.S. or EU economic sanctions or export controls. However, laws, regulations or licensing policies on economic
sanctions or export controls could change in a way that could affect our business, exports or sales in such countries
and/or could result in restrictions, penalties or fines. Non-compliance with current or future applicable laws or


-----

regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If any of the risks described above materialize, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our manufacturing facilities are subject to operating risks._**

We are dependent on the continued operation of its manufacturing facilities. These facilities are subject to hazards
associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation of chemical materials and products,
including tank and pipeline leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical
failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, and environmental risks. These
hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment,
and environmental contamination. The occurrence of material operating problems at any of our facilities may
diminish or eliminate our ability to manufacture products. Further, from time to time, we may experience capacity
limitations in our manufacturing operations. If we are unable to effectively forecast our customers’ demand, it
could affect our ability to successfully manage such operating capacity limitations.

**_Compliance with SHE laws and regulations and the retention of requisite permits related to our operations_**
**_could result in significant ongoing costs and may result in further obligations and liabilities associated with_**
**_our businesses._**

We are subject to a wide range of SHE laws and regulations that govern our facilities, operations and products.
Such regulations govern activities including the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and
disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges, greenhouse gas emissions, noise emissions,
operation and closure of landfills, human health and safety, process safety and risk management and the clean-up
of contaminated sites and are present in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our operations require
permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and
revocation by issuing authorities and are frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of
improvement works at the relevant sites. Typically, these permits require continuous compliance with certain
conditions in order to maintain the permit, and they may include requirements and conditions which have not yet
been finally determined, which could result in significant additional costs or environmental obligations for us. We
have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure
compliance with current and future SHE laws and regulations.

The SHE laws, regulations and permits that govern our operations tend to become increasingly stringent over
time, and we could in the future assume additional obligations and therefore incur substantial incremental costs
to ensure our continued regulatory compliance. If we do not accurately predict and adequately provision for the
amount or timing of costs of any future compliance or if we misinterpret our obligations under any of these
regulatory changes, we may find ourselves in violation of SHE laws, regulations or permits. Given the nature of
our business, violations of SHE requirements, whether current or future, may result in substantial fines or
penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs and other remediation or restoration
requirements, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control
equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities. The impact on our business,
financial condition or results of operations in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_We may be subject to ongoing costs and regulations related to contamination or exposure impacts from our_**
**_operations or products._**

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities. Some
environmental laws, regulations and court decisions impose liability on present and former owners, operators or
users of, or the generators of waste disposed at, facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites
without regard to causation, negligence or knowledge of contamination. Historically, environmental assessments
of certain of our sites have revealed recognized environmental conditions and from time to time, our internal
audits have shown instances of regulatory noncompliance and recommendations of remediation. There are
significant costs associated with such remediation as well as with general compliance with increasingly stringent
environmental regulations. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new


-----

obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at or in connection with our facilities, could result in
substantial costs.

While we are protected by contractual indemnities from prior owners or operators against some environmental
liabilities related to known contamination or have insurance coverage relating to such costs, there is a risk that we
will be unable to recover all potential costs under such indemnity provisions or insurance contracts in all cases.
We could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and,
if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impacts on our business, financial
condition and results of operations in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw materials_**
**_could adversely affect our business._**

We must comply with a broad range of regulations relating to the testing, manufacturing, labelling and safety
analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers. In some jurisdictions, including the United States and
the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and
we expect that this trend will continue.

In particular, in the European Union, our products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into
and/or sold in the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations
governing the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union
Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC)
No. 1907/2006) (“REACH”) (as amended and updated from time to time), imposes significant obligations on the
chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of building block
and semi-speciality chemicals. REACH is reviewed annually and, as a result, new regulations that further impact
our businesses and operations may be proposed and implemented in the future. The European Union Regulation
on classification, labelling and packaging (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) (“CLP”), imposes further obligations
in relation to the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals. Uncertainty remains as to the future of
chemicals regulation in the U.K. following the U.K.’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”). Although
the U.K. is currently still operating under REACH during the transitional period, it is unclear whether REACH or
any similar legislation will continue to apply following December 31, 2020.

As of March 31, 2020, we registered all substances currently required to be registered under REACH. However,
we still expect to incur certain ongoing compliance costs as well as costs associated with the registration of any
applicable new products. In connection with REACH and CLP requirements, any raw material, chemical or
substance, including our products, as well as being subject to the registration, classification, labelling and
packaging requirements that these regulations impose, could be classified as having a toxicological or health
related impact on the environment, on users of our products or on our employees. In particular, REACH requires
a costly and time-consuming authorization process for any chemical that has been deemed to be a Substance of
Very High Concern and which has been listed by the European Commission in Annex XIV to REACH to remain
on the market. Inclusion of a product in Annex XIV triggers various obligations to produce information on the
product and its properties to customers and downstream users. As part of the authorization process, we would
have to demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated with uses of this substance are
adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits of its use outweigh the risks. We must also analyze
whether there are safer suitable alternatives or technologies available. If authorization is obtained, it will only be
for a limited period after which there is a risk that such authorization will not be renewed or that an alternative
would have been found.

In the United States, our operations are subject to federal and state regulation of chemicals, including the Toxic
Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). On June 22, 2016, legislation significantly amending TSCA was enacted into
law. TSCA allows screening of our products by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which increases the
risk of screening that may lead to a range of regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including a possible
prohibition on manufacture and sale.

**_Certain changes in rules and regulations governing our products could adversely impact our business._**

The process of seeking regulatory approval of certain new products and production processes can be timeconsuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays, and such approvals may ultimately not be granted


-----

at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our
ability to introduce new products, to continue distributing existing products, and to generate revenue from those
products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.

In addition to the laws and regulations currently applicable to our products, new laws and regulations may be
introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs, confiscation, recall or monetary fines,
any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of the Enlarged our products.

In particular, Brexit may result in changes to the regulatory framework governing our operations. Our
headquarters are located in the U.K. and we are listed on the London Stock Exchange and therefore subject to
U.K. laws and regulations. However, the extent to which the new regulatory framework to be adopted in the U.K.
and the extent to which it will deviate from existing EU regulations will not be known for several years. Since a
significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. applicable to our business and our products is
derived from EU directives and regulations, the withdrawal could materially impact the regulatory regime
applicable to our operations in the U.K. See “—Developments in the EU, market perceptions concerning any
_uncertainties or instability with regard to the future of the U.K.’s relationships with the EU or the future of the_
_euro and the Eurozone could have adverse consequences for the Enlarged Group” below. Moreover, many of our_
customers are subject to similar regulations. If a significant customer or group of customers were to have an
important permit, license, registration or authorization revoked, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also exposed to global import and export tariffs as a result of our international operations. For example,
in recent years the United States Government has enacted various tax reform legislation, has eased regulatory
requirements and has modified its trade policy with certain countries. These developments, as well as other
regulatory or legislative changes, may impact economic conditions in the United States and other countries as
well as the cost of importing goods into and exporting goods out of the United States. Any changes in the laws
and regulations and tariffs to which we are subject, including the discontinuation of any tariff incentives that we
currently use, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The loss of key customers for certain products could materially affect our business._**

Although we do not rely on any single customer for a substantial portion of our revenues, if we lose any key
customers, we may be unable to find alternative buyers to purchase the same products in the same quantities, if at
all, at similar price levels and/or on the same terms.

Some of our largest contracts typically have minimum order commitments, although in practice we treat these
commitments as guidelines rather than enforceable arrangements. Although no single customer accounts for a
significant proportion of our revenues, within any given product type or end market we may rely on a small
number of key customers. While we do not anticipate the loss of our key customers, we may lose customers due
to, among other things, industry consolidation, customer dissatisfaction or competition, which could lead to a
significant increase in inventories or decrease in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We face certain risks relating to the loss of customers as we generally do not have long-term contracts with our
customers. With some exceptions, most of our business is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than through
long-term contracts. Accordingly, customers may elect to discontinue business with us with limited or no notice
and with limited recourse. Additionally, certain of our product lines contribute disproportionately to our
profitability. Thus, the loss of customers for these products could have a material adverse effect on our financial
results.

**_We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from non-payment or non-performance by our customers._**

Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to minimize or mitigate customer credit risk and our
customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations. These
and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential financial weakness
in our industry, may increase the risk in extending trade credit to customers. A significant adverse change in a
customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with
that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to


-----

collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

**_We have limited control over our joint ventures and other similar business arrangements, which may impede_**
**_the strategic role of these entities within our operations._**

We have made, and may continue to make, investments and acquisitions and enter into joint ventures. Our ability
to control these joint ventures or receive dividends, royalties and other payments from joint ventures generally
depends not only on the joint venture’s cash flow and profits, but also upon the terms of the joint venture
agreement with our partners. There is a risk that the steps that we have taken to protect our interests in joint
ventures, have not been, or will not be, effective. Further, there is a risk that our relationships with our joint venture
partners will deteriorate in the future and result in a significant disagreement.

The success of joint ventures and other similar arrangements is not always predictable and we may not realize our
anticipated objectives. The bankruptcy, insolvency or severe financial distress of our business or those of any of
our partners could adversely affect our joint ventures or similar business arrangements. Should these joint ventures
not perform as expected we may be unable to execute on our expansion strategies as anticipated, and may incur
losses or other liabilities that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

**_Developments in the EU, market perceptions concerning any uncertainties or instability with regard to the_**
**_future of the U.K.’s relationships with the EU or the future of the euro and the Eurozone could have adverse_**
**_consequences for us._**

The U.K. has withdrawn from the European Union and has commenced negotiations with the EU to enter into a
new trade agreement and is in a transition period until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K.
continues to have access to the EU single market and customs union. However, if no trade agreement is reached
during the transition period, the U.K. may lose access to the EU single market and customs union without a
suitable alternate arrangement in place, which may impact the general and economic conditions in the U.K. and
the European Union. The terms of any new trade agreement and the nature of the future relationship between the
U.K. and European Union remain unclear.

Our headquarters are located in the U.K. and sales to the U.K. accounted for 4.4% of our combined total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also have significant sales into the U.K. from the U.S. There is
uncertainty as to whether the terms of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU will differ materially from
the terms in place before the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU and as to how long it will take to negotiate such
terms. Until the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU are clearer, it is not possible to determine the
impact that the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union and/or any related matters may have on our business.
Developments relating to the U.K.’s exit from the EU have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect
on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global
market liquidity and restrict our ability to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations and currency
exchange rates may be especially subject to increased market volatility, which in turn may affect our business
operations by increasing the cost of servicing our borrowings subject to variable interest rates. Lack of clarity
about future U.K. laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate,
including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws, and employment laws,
could increase our costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital. Any of these factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Since 2010, global markets and economic conditions have been negatively impacted by market perceptions
regarding the ability of certain EU member states (each a “Member State” and collectively, “Member States”)
to service their sovereign debt obligations, including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Concerns persist
regarding the outcome of the European Union governments’ financial support programs, the possibility that other
Member States may experience similar financial troubles, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the
euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States.
The impact of COVID-19 on the domestic economies of each Member State has varied, as has the rate of recovery
from the COVID-19 pandemic of each Member State. Certain Member States have been, and may continue to be,
more greatly affected by the economic and social effects of COVID-19 than other Member States, which could
lead to further instability in the European Union.


-----

These and other concerns have caused macroeconomic disruption, instability in financial markets and a weakening
of the exchange rate of the euro against other world currencies and may in the future also lead to additional calls
for referenda on membership or the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States, or, in
particularly dire circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. The occurrence of any of these
circumstances could have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may incur litigation-related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to our product_**
**_quality._**

Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials and we have been from time to time, and in the future may
be, subject to claims made in relation to our property and operations or for personal injury. While we do not
currently have any material exposure in terms of SHE litigation, from time to time contractors or employees have
been harmed during the course of their employment. Injuries to contractors and employees may occur in the future.

From time to time, we have been subject to various claims, proceedings and lawsuits related to products, services,
contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property and other matters arising out of our business
operations or the business operations of our predecessors. For example, in December 2019, the China Customs
office in Shanghai notified OMNOVA that it intended to issue a finding that OMNOVA had previously used an
incorrect customs code in connection with exports from China in respect of a small product line. As a result, the
local Shanghai taxing authority are seeking to recoup certain value added tax (“VAT”) refunds previously received
by OMNOVA and impose additional fines. For more information, see “Business—OMNOVA Overview—Legal
_Proceedings.” Whether founded or unfounded, if any such claims, proceedings, or lawsuits are not resolved in_
our favor, they may result in significant financial liability, negatively impact our business operations, and harm
our reputation. The costs of investigating and defending against claims can be substantial and the insurance we
have may not be adequate.

In addition, the we may be subject to litigation and the cost or the ultimate outcome of such litigation or other
proceedings, including remedies or damage awards, cannot be predicted. Adverse results in any litigation or other
proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited
to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, environmental, health and safety, joint
venture agreements, labor and employment or other harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities
outside of our control.

Furthermore, our products have widespread uses in a variety of end-markets, including transportation, consumer
products, building and construction, industrial and health and protection. Product quality and reliability are key
elements of our competitive position and we may lose customers and potentially be liable for damages for any
quality issues. We have in the past, and may in the future, be named as defendants in product liability claims.
Were any such product liability claim or series of claims arising out of these various uses (particularly where the
value of such claims are in excess of our insurance coverage, applicable indemnification agreements, or any
provision we made), to be successful against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We could be required to increase our debt or divert resources from other
investments in our business in order to discharge any such claims, or might not be able to cover such claims at all.
Additionally, new discoveries about the safety of our products may be made in the future and such discoveries
may lead to a substantial decline of the sale of any affected products, both of which could materially affect the
profitability of our operations.

More generally, in the chemicals industry, products are subject to public scrutiny and may become the target of
environmental group protests and campaigns, which, in turn, could lead the public to develop a negative perception
of certain of our products, which could materially affect sales and volumes of such products.

**_We may fail to develop new, commercially viable products or find sufficient commercial use for those products_**
**_that we have already developed._**

Our business is partially driven by the continuous development of new and innovative products, including
environmentally sustainable products and manufacturing processes. A significant amount of capital needs to be
dedicated to develop new products, for which the process is lengthy and results are uncertain. See “Business—
_Product Development—Research and Development.” Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the commercial success_
of new products unproven in the marketplace. Potential new products that appear promising during the


-----

development stage may fail to reach the market or have only limited commercial success. This could be
attributable to any number of factors, including efficacy or safety concerns, an inability to obtain necessary
regulatory approvals in certain geographic markets, difficulties in manufacturing or excessive manufacturing
costs, erosion of patent terms as a result of a lengthy development period, infringement of patents or other
intellectual property rights of others or an inability to differentiate the product adequately from our competitors.
Any failure to develop commercially viable products or to develop additional uses for existing products could
make us less competitive and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

If our expectations for the market performance of our products launched in the prior five years are not realized,
we may be unable to recover development costs or to keep pace with the innovations of new or existing
competitors, we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers, any of which could reduce
demand for any of our key products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

**_We may not be able to adjust our products or technologies to address our customers’ changing requirements_**
**_or competitive challenges in a timely manner, and our customers may substitute our products with other_**
**_products._**

The market segments where our customers compete are subject to periodic technological changes, ongoing
product improvements, product substitution and changes in customer requirements. Increased competition from
existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar
functionality to our products may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify, develop and
market innovative products on a timely basis to meet our customers’ changing requirements and competitive
challenges. However, if we are unable to substantially maintain or further develop our product portfolio and
develop our proportion of sales of products launched in the prior five years, customers may elect to source
comparable products from competitors, which could have a detrimental impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We cannot be certain that the investments we make in our technology and development will result in proportional
increases in revenue or profits. Our research and development and application technology teams work closely
with our customers to develop high-quality, innovative products and applications that are tailored to meet their
specific requirements. See “Business—Product Development—Research and Development.” However, we may
not be able to develop products that adequately address our customers’ needs. In addition, the timely
commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other
technical difficulties, industry acceptance or insufficient industry size to support a new product, competitors’ new
products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or
delays could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Alternative materials, procedures or technologies may be developed, or existing ones may be improved, and
replace those that are currently offered by us. If such newly developed or improved products are being offered at
lower prices, have preferable features or other advantages, particularly from a regulatory perspective, and we are
not able to offer similar new or improved products, we may lose substantial business, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at our facilities could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our level of asset utilization, as well as our overall business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

As of December 31, 2019 after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Acquisition, we had 38 active manufacturing
facilities globally, and our results of operations are dependent on the continued operation of our production
facilities and the maintenance of high levels of asset utilization, the transport infrastructure that carries supplies
to them and the ability to complete planned construction, capacity expansion and maintenance projects on
schedule.

Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemicals manufacturing and the related use, storage,
transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and wastes, including:


-----

- severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods, extreme temperature
fluctuations or any other natural or man-made disaster or other adverse weather conditions;

- explosions and other accidents, including pipeline leaks and ruptures;

- human error or mechanical failures;

- unplanned production downtime;

- transportation interruptions;

- negligent actions of third parties;

- terrorism or sabotage aimed at disrupting our production facilities;

- unpermitted discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; and

- other environmental health, safety and security risks.

These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and
equipment, delays in the transportation of products, as well as environmental damage, and may result in
suspension of operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and damage
awards. See “—We may incur litigation-related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to
_our product quality” above._

Additionally, many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content.
Transportation and storage of these products can be costly, given the size and weight of water-based products as
well as the hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals.

We also have scheduled shutdowns at our production facilities in order to perform necessary inspections and
testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out maintenance that may be necessary.
Scheduled shutdowns may require longer downtime than anticipated. Unscheduled shutdowns may occur due to
technical failure or other reasons.

Extended downtime at any of our major operating facilities, whether the result of a scheduled shutdown or
otherwise, could reduce rates of asset utilization and undermine our ability to maintain high production volumes
and meet our commitment to customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. Any significant interruption occurring from time to time in operations at our facilities,
including interruptions caused by the events described above, may exceed the limitations of our current insurance
coverage, see “—Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated
_changes in our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial_
_position or our results of operations” below, and thus require increased capital expenditure, and may materially_
reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular production plant, or our business as a whole, during and
after such interruptions. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our success depends on the continued service of certain key personnel._**

A significant part of our continued success is dependent on our ability to retain the services of our management
team, directors and senior management, including business area managers, heads of certain corporate or business
functions, regional sales and country managers, market development and research and development experts, as
well as key technical specialists and project managers. The Acquisition of OMNOVA provided us with the ability
to further expand our management and research capabilities, and as part of the Acquisition, we retained Mr.
Marshall Moore to serve as our Chief Technology Officer. Mr. Moore has extensive experience in a range of
leadership roles at OMNOVA and GE Plastics.

In addition, our future growth and success also depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled
managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical personnel. We generally have employment agreements
with, but we do not maintain any “key man” life insurance for, members of our senior management. The loss of


-----

one such key personnel, or the failure to attract and retain additional key personnel, could have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to carry out acquisitions or mergers due to regulatory restrictions on business acquisitions_**
**_and mergers or we may become subject to antitrust regulations as a consequence of our position in certain_**
**_markets._**

Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust authorities under antitrust
regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of jurisdictions. Furthermore, as a consequence of our strong
positions in certain of our markets, we may be considered by antitrust regulatory authorities to have a dominant
position which could subject us to certain limitations in our ability to act on the market by adjusting our prices or
otherwise. If such approvals of a proposed acquisition or merger prove necessary, approval of the transaction may
require, based on the relevant antirust authority’s evaluation of prevailing market conditions and our position in
the market, that it divest certain businesses in order to carry out the transaction. For example, as a condition to
clearance by the European antirust regulatory authorities, Synthomer was required to divest its small VP Latex
business in Germany. We may also be prohibited by antitrust authorities from carrying out transactions. Any of
these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may be subject to antitrust or other regulatory investigations._**

As announced on June 8, 2018, the European Commission initiated an investigation into practices relating to the
purchase of styrene monomer by companies, including Synthomer, operating in the European Economic Area.
We take competition laws very seriously and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission during its
ongoing investigation.

Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in investigations into suspected anticompetitive practices. An
adverse outcome in these proceedings, or any similar proceedings in the EEA or elsewhere in the future, could
impose significant costs and fines on us, damage our reputation and result in claims from customers or could
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The
maximum possible fine we may face from the European Commission is capped at 10% of our worldwide turnover
for the financial year preceding the date of the European Commission decision. See “Business—Legal and
_Regulatory Proceedings.” In the event of such an adverse outcome, we cannot assure you of the extent to which_
our cooperation with the ongoing investigation or any other measures we have taken or may take would result in
a reduction of any fines or a mitigation of any other sanctions imposed as a consequence.

**_We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights._**

Proprietary protection of our products and processes is important to our business success and competitive position,
and we have an extensive portfolio of registered patents and trademarks. Our actions to protect our proprietary
rights may be insufficient to prevent others from developing similar products to ours.

Despite our efforts, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same
extent as do the laws of England and Wales, United States or the European Union. Furthermore, any pending
patent application filed by us may not result in an issued patent, or if such patents are issued to us, such patents
may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. The expiration
of a patent or the failure of our patents to protect our formulations, processes, apparatuses, technology or
proprietary know-how could result in intense competition, with consequent erosion of profit margins. In addition,
our competitors and any other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully
manufacture and market our products in a competitive manner, which could materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We also rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, along
with other trade secrets, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Third parties (including our
competitors) may develop such knowledge or technology independently without violating our trade secret rights.
While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our
intellectual property:


-----

- our confidentiality agreements may be breached;

- such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how;
or

- adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade
secrets and know-how.

Insufficient protection of intellectual property may limit our ability to make use of technological advantages or
result in a reduction of future profits. This may cause competitive restrictions and have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are sued for infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties, it may be costly and time-_**
**_consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business._**

The use of intellectual property may expose us to ongoing litigation, regarding either intellectual property claims
made by or against us. For a description of the risks inherent in being a litigation defendant, see “—We may incur
_litigation-related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to its product quality” above. We_
may spend significant time and effort and incur significant litigation costs if we are required to defend ourselves
against intellectual property rights claims brought against us, regardless of whether the claims have merit. If we
are found to have infringed on the patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to
substantial claims for damages, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We may also be required to cease development, use or sale of the relevant products or processes, or
we may be required to obtain a license on the disputed rights, which may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. Even where we initiate litigation, such legal activity is costly and may divert technical
and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, we may not prevail in any such
litigation or proceeding. A determination in an intellectual property litigation or proceeding that results in a finding
of a non-infringement by others to our intellectual property or an invalidation of our patents may result in the use
by competitors of our technologies or processes and sale by competitors of products that resemble our products,
which may adversely affect our ability to compete as well as create increased supply and corresponding downward
pricing pressure.

**_We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of cyber_**
**_security. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption_**
**_and/or financial loss._**

The industries in which we operate have become increasingly dependent on information technology to conduct
certain processing activities. For example, we depend on information technology to perform many of our services
and to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate
attacks, have increased. The technologies, systems and networks utilized by us and our vendors, suppliers and
other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result
in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other
information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance,
may remain undetected for an extended period.

As a result of the social distancing measures and regulations enforced by governments in connection with COVID19, and the resulting work-from-home policies that we have undertaken, there has been additional reliance placed
on our IT systems and resources. The resulting reliance on these resources, and the added need to communicate
by electronic means, could increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents.

Our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to
evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective
measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, we rely on our
information technology systems for regulatory compliance, including the EU-wide General Data Protection
Regulation (the “GDPR”) which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and if a significant or widely publicized
unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a failure of our information
technology security systems, employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims
by individuals, fines or other enforcement action.


-----

Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems, network
disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our operational efficiencies,
delaying processing of transactions and inhibiting our ability to protect customer or internal information. Our
computer systems, including our backup systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer
and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires,
earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps to
address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security, backup systems and internal control
measures, a system failure or data security breach could occur and materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in_**
**_our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position or_**
**_our results of operations._**

Our plant, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage and business interruption risks, and our
business as a whole is insured for product liability risks. In addition, we carry environmental liability, marine
cargo, and director and officer liability insurance. However, such insurance may not cover all risks associated
with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities
covered. We may incur losses beyond these maximum limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. If
this occurs, and we face liability, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. For details of such potential liabilities, see “—The occurrence of major operational
_interruptions or problems at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our level of asset utilization, as_
_well as our overall business, financial condition and results of operations” above._

In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been available
on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be
able to obtain coverage at current levels, and/or our premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies may
increase significantly on the coverage that we currently maintain. If insurance is not available at economically
acceptable premiums, there is a risk that our insurance coverage does not cover the full scope and extent of claims
against us or losses that we incur, including, but not limited to, claims for environmental or industrial accidents,
occupational illnesses, pollution and product liability and business interruption. Furthermore, we could be required
to increase our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business to discharge an uninsured claim.
Costs associated with unanticipated events in excess of our insurance coverage, or a failure to maintain such
coverage could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in relations with our employees._**

As of December 31, 2019 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Acquisition, we employed approximately
4,750 employees on a full-time equivalent basis across manufacturing sites in 24 countries. Nearly half of our
non-management employees outside the United States are covered by some form of collective bargaining
arrangement at site or national level or a works council agreement. In addition, a significant portion of our
employees reside in countries in which employment laws provide our employees with significant bargaining
power or other rights that may require us to spend more time and expenses when altering or amending employees’
terms of employment or making staff reductions. For example, many of our employees in Europe are represented
by unions or works councils, which are on the board of directors by law and generally must approve changes in
conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits.

Similarly, approximately 12% of the employees of OMNOVA in the United States are covered by collective
bargaining agreements and certain employees of the foreign operations of OMNOVA are covered by collective
bargaining agreements. As of November 30, 2019, OMNOVA had approximately 1,850 employees.

We may not be able to renew any such collective bargaining agreements or work council agreements on terms
similar to current terms, or renegotiate such agreements on acceptable terms. Additionally, in foreign jurisdictions
where we operate, national unions and foreign governments may be unable to reach agreements, which could
result in work stoppages that are out of our control. Furthermore, if a collective bargaining agreement or a works
council agreement is negotiated at higher-than-anticipated cost, such costs may need to be absorbed by us, or be
passed through to customers in the form of higher prices which may make us less competitive.

Further, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our employment
terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on such facility’s operations
and, potentially, on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There is a risk that our employees
could strike in the future, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may_**
**_adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost._**

Our pension cost and liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the
level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested
assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly equity
securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Any change in key actuarial assumptions,
such as the discount rate, would impact the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status
of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following financial years. Any declines in the
fair values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified
funding levels. Any decrease in interest rates will result in an increase of pension liabilities. Our defined benefit
pension scheme contains a high proportion of equity assets, which exposes the scheme to volatility in equity
markets and which may therefore result in significant fluctuations in the size of the deficit. As of December 31,
2019, the deficit in relation to Synthomer’s defined benefit pension schemes stood at £140.0 million, calculated
in accordance with IAS 19 while deficit recovery contributions amounted to £16 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable
jurisdictions.

OMNOVA maintains a U.S. pension plan which is underfunded. OMNOVA intends to make cash contributions
to its pension plans of $6.6 million in 2020 to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by U.S.
benefit and tax laws. As of November 30, 2019 the unfunded liability of OMNOVA’s pension plan amounted to
$76.2 million. Contribution amounts are based on plan performance, interest rates, and pension funding
legislation, among other factors. We cannot predict whether changing conditions including interest rates, pension
assets performance, discount rates, government regulation or other factors will require us to make future
contributions to the pension scheme, or whether we will have the funds necessary to make minimum pension
contributions at the times that they may be required. As a result, we may incur higher than expected costs or other
liabilities associated with funding the pension plan.

**_The value of our intangible assets could become impaired._**

Our results of operations may vary due to the impairment of goodwill and/or other intangible assets relating to the
acquisition of acquired trademarks and licenses and acquired customer-related intangible assets. We conduct
annual impairment tests on goodwill and annual assessments of the carrying values of intangible and tangible
assets when impairment indicators exist. As a result, declines in our profitability or the value of comparable
companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units and result in an impairment in the value of goodwill,
brands or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operation.

**_Continuing increase in employee healthcare costs ._**

In the United States, we maintain a self-insured healthcare plan under which we generally share the cost of
healthcare with certain of our employees and retirees located in the United States. The cost of operating this
healthcare plan is significant and such costs have continued to increase in excess of other inflationary trends over
the past several years. There is a risk that, if healthcare costs continue to increase, we may not be able or willing
to pass these costs to our employees and retirees located in the United States. As a result, our financial condition
could be materially adversely affected.

**_We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities._**

Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Significant
judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary


-----

course of our business, there are various transactions and calculations, including intercompany transactions and
cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to
interpretation. We are regularly audited by tax authorities who may disagree with our tax estimates or judgments.
Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits could differ
from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final
determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, we are and may in the
future become involved in proceedings with national or regional tax authorities. For example, we are currently
the subject of ongoing tax proceedings in Spain arising out of a tax audit conducted with respect to the years 2003,
2004 and 2005 and a further audit for the years 2006 to 2008. Although the relevant Spanish authorities made an
adverse determination against us and imposed tax assessments totaling €13.6 million, the matter is currently in
the process of being appealed. In addition, we are currently the subject of ongoing tax proceedings in the U.K.
arising out of a tax audit conducted with respect to the years 2001 and 2002 for £10.2 million. For more
information see “Business—Legal and Regulatory Proceedings.” While we attempt to assess in advance the
likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, it is difficult to predict final
outcomes with any degree of certainty.

In addition, changes in tax legislation or guidance could affect our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax
assets or our deferred tax liabilities. For example, enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States on
December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”) introduced broad and complex tax reforms. We continue to assess and
evaluate the impacts of these tax reforms on our business. As our analysis of the recent tax reform and subsequent
guidance continues, there can be no assurances that our future financial results will not be adversely affected.

Any tax audit, tax proceeding or changes in tax legislation or guidance could, as a result of any of the above risks,
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of financial results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS while OMNOVA’s consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Following completion of the Acquisition,
OMNOVA became a subsidiary of Synthomer and the accounting policies, where applicable, applied to the
OMNOVA Group have become the same as those applied to Synthomer, including the adoption of IFRS and the
adoption of a calendar year-end. Effective from the Completion Date, Synthomer has commenced consolidating
OMNOVA’s financial information and will prepare consolidated financial statement of Synthomer as the
Enlarged Group in accordance with IFRS. Any recent or future changes in these accounting standards may have
a significant impact on our reported results and financial condition.

There are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been issued by the IASB that have
had an effect on our presentation of financial information. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and introduces new requirements for the classification and
measurement of financial assets, in particular, the impairment of financial assets. IFRS 15 is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and introduced a comprehensive framework for revenue recognition,
including revenue from advanced ticket and accommodation sales and sales of annual passes. IFRS 16 is effective
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 and provides a single lease accounting model, recognizing
most leases on the statement of financial position. The standard replaces the dual lease accounting model approach
of IAS 17, which treats finance leases and operating leases separately. Any one or combination of these or other
changes to accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION**

**_Our success will be dependent upon our ability to integrate OMNOVA into the Enlarged Group and deliver the_**
**_value of the combined underlying businesses; the full financial benefits and synergies expected from the_**
**_Acquisition may not be fully achieved._**

Synthomer and OMNOVA have historically operated independently and there can be no assurances that the
OMNOVA businesses can be fully integrated successfully. Since April 1, 2020, OMNOVA has operated within
the existing Synthomer business, with the integration of OMNOVA progressing in line with our expectations.
However, there can be no assurances that we continue to generate expected synergies. To the extent that we are
unable to efficiently integrate OMNOVA’s operations into ours, realize anticipated financial benefits and


-----

synergies, retain key personnel and avoid unforeseen costs or delay, there may be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and result of operations.

Our success will depend, in part, on the effectiveness of the integration process and our ability to realize the
anticipated financial benefits and synergies from combining the respective businesses. We established an
integration office to co-ordinate and track some of the key integration challenges of combining the businesses,
including consolidation and coordinating services and operations, retaining key contracts, maintaining
relationships with customers and suppliers, harmonizing business cultures, consolidating infrastructure,
procedures, processes, facilities, systems and policies and compensation structures, realizing synergies, and
retaining key employees. If we do not properly manage these challenges, they may affect the effective running of
the business in the ordinary course and the efficient allocation, including redeployment, of our resources.

While we believe that the financial benefits and synergies of the Acquisition and the costs associated with the
Acquisition have been reasonably estimated, unanticipated events or liabilities may arise or become apparent
which result in a delay or reduction in the benefits anticipated to be derived from the Acquisition, or in costs
significantly in excess of those estimated. No assurance can be given that the integration process will deliver all
or substantially all of the expected benefits or realize any such benefits within the assumed timeframe, or that the
costs to integrate and achieve the financial benefits and synergies will not be higher than anticipated.

Further, the demands of the integration process on management time could result in diversion of the attention of
our management and employees from ongoing operations, pursuing other potential business opportunities and
may cause a delay in other projects currently contemplated by each group.

In addition, due to uncertainty about the effect the Acquisition will have on OMNOVA’s employees, customers,
suppliers, distributors and other parties, there can be no assurance that OMNOVA’s employees, including key
personnel, can be hired or retained to the same extent that OMNOVA has previously been able to retain them.
Parties with which we do business, including OMNOVA’s historical suppliers and distributors, may experience
uncertainty as a result of the Acquisition.

The total amount of synergies that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ
significantly (and may be significantly lower) from those that we are currently targeting. Also, the assumptions
made in OMNOVA’s business plans may be incorrect, in particular with respect to synergies and performance.
Finally, we may incur significant costs in realizing the integration of OMNOVA and in achieving the estimated
synergies, and the integration costs may be higher than expected. If one or more of our underlying assumptions
regarding these initiatives proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead us to incur substantially higher
costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize at all, such synergies and cost savings in the
anticipated timeframe. Furthermore, cost efficiencies may not be able to be sustained due to our inability to
integrate OMNOVA, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues or other cost variables. As a
result, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the synergies and cost savings adjustments included
in the calculation of pro forma EBITDA included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to realize the totality of these synergies or cost savings, and the costs we incur in trying to
realize these synergies may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits.
Failure to achieve the expected synergies may result in a lower return on investment for the Acquisition, and could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_Our opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to OMNOVA was limited and we may discover that_**
**_OMNOVA has liabilities that could impact our business and financial condition._**

In order to determine the value of OMNOVA (and thus the price that we paid), we conducted limited due diligence
investigations. No assurance can be given that our investigations identified all material regulatory, contractual or
other issues or liabilities related to OMNOVA, or that factors outside our control will not later arise. If we failed
to identify material issues, we may be forced to write down or write off assets, restructure our operations or incur
impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Any unidentified or unanticipated liabilities,
individually or in the aggregate, could hinder the continued integration of OMNOVA into our Group and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_As a result of the Acquisition, we expect to record a significant amount of goodwill, which could thereafter be_**
**_subject to the risk of impairments in the event of adverse changes to the underlying assumptions as to the_**
**_results and cash flows from the acquired businesses._**

We expect to record substantial amounts of goodwill in connection with the Acquisition. These amounts will be
recorded based on the excess of the amounts paid to acquire OMNOVA based on the fair value of its net assets at
the date of the Acquisition. The resulting unaudited pro forma goodwill balance is £759.5 million. This amount
is preliminary and the definitive amount of goodwill to be recorded will be determined based on the determination
of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as at the date control is obtained. The
purchase accounting adjustments to record the assets and liabilities at fair value have not yet been finalized,
therefore the amount of goodwill may be materially different from the preliminary amount. See “Unaudited Pro
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”_

Following the recording of the definitive amounts of goodwill, we may subsequently experience unforeseen issues
with the OMNOVA business, which may adversely affect the anticipated returns or value of the intangible assets
and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for OMNOVA. In
accordance with IFRS, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or when changes in the circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts units are determined on the basis of
value in use calculations, which depend on certain key assumptions. If management’s projections change, the
estimate of the recoverable amount of goodwill could fall significantly and result in impairment. While
impairment does not affect reported cash flows, EBITDA or any Underlying Performance measures, the decrease
of the estimated recoverable amount and the related non-cash charge in the income statement could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, net equity or financial condition as reported under IFRS.

**_Certain of OMNOVA’s contracts contain change of control provisions, which may allow their counterparties_**
**_to terminate the contract under circumstances such as the Acquisition._**

Certain of OMNOVA’s contracts contain “change of control” provisions that require them to notify the
counterparty of a potential change of control or contain language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to
certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract.

We have performed a risk analysis of the change of control provisions in those contracts as well as OMNOVA’s
relationships with the various counterparties and management is unaware of any terminations as a result of a
change of control provision in the weeks following the Acquisition. However, we may have failed to identify and
may fail to send notices of the Acquisition to all of OMNOVA’s counterparties who they are contractually required
to notify of the Acquisition, and we may fail to seek formal consent from every counterparty that might have a
termination or other right under a change of control provision. There can be no assurance that counterparties will
not seek to exercise termination or other relevant rights in the future. If a substantial number of these contracts
were terminated or materially altered as a result of the Acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts.
We may be unable to renegotiate contracts or enter into new contracts on terms acceptable to us or comparable to
the terms in place prior to the Acquisition. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION**

**_Our leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

As at March 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, our pro forma net borrowings would have been
£658.9 million and our ratio of pro forma net borrowings to as adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA would have
been 2.5x. For computations of our pro forma net borrowings and our ratio of pro forma net borrowings to as
adjusted run-rate pro forma EBITDA, see “Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Financial and
_Other Information For Synthomer—Other Financial and Operating Data and Unaudited Pro Forma Combined_
_Financial Data.” On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance_
sheet, to (i) repay the Bridge Facilities and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the Offering. See
“Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Debt.”


-----

Our leverage can have important consequences for our business and operations, including:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to
cash flow;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- restricting us from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs
of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness that could further increase our leverage and may have terms that are_**
**_more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt, to fund
any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually
evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt
capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be
made at our election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on
the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt
will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest
rate applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is
being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In
addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt
and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such
additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable
than the terms of the Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to
raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance
as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new
debt in addition to our current debt and the Notes, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing
transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, could intensify.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Among other things, the Indenture will limit our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

- pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

- make certain other restricted payments;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;


-----

- impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

- transfer or sell assets;

- consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires us to maintain a certain Gearing Ratio (as defined
in the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement), which is the ratio of our consolidated total net borrowings
(excluding the impact of IFRS 16) to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2019 Syndicated Facilities
Agreement). If this financial covenant is breached, including as a result of conditions outside of our control, such
as a decline in our financial performance due to general economic conditions, it may result in an event of default
under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the 2019
Syndicated Facilities, which may result in an event of default under the Notes. Further, the 2019 Syndicated
Facilities Agreement limits, among other things, our ability to acquire or sell certain assets, to undergo certain
corporate actions (such as mergers and de-mergers) or to create security over our assets. See “Description of Other
_Debt.”_

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants” and “Description of Other Debt.” These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our
interest.

If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, we will be in default under the Indenture, the 2019 Syndicated
Facilities, and/or the relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or
the applicable creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest on the Notes or the applicable amounts
due and payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to an event of default
and acceleration under our other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions,
including the Indenture. These restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to finance future operations
or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants”_ and “Description of Other Debt.”

**_Any impairment of our ability to draw funds under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business operations._**

Our operations have been primarily financed using cash generated in our operations and debt financing. Following
the Transactions, we will rely on existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and any
borrowings under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities for the general and working capital purposes of the Enlarged
Group. Further, if we were unable to draw funds under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities, we may need to find
alternative sources of funds, which may be at higher interest rates. There also can be no assurance that we will
have sufficient cash resources on hand at any given time to meet our expenses or debt servicing requirements. Our
ability to draw on the 2019 Syndicated Facilities depends on, among other things, our ability to satisfy certain
financial covenants. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and other required conditions to drawing could be
affected by a number of factors, including by events beyond our control. In addition, our inability to maintain
these financial ratios may also result in an event of default under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, which
would prohibit us from drawing funds under those facilities and potentially trigger a cross-default under the
Indenture or our other debt instruments. See “—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our
_ability to finance our future operations and capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities” above._
This inability to draw funds under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities or to maintain our operations due to a lack of
cash flow could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate
cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service
our debt.


-----

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital and to make
capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends on the success of our business strategy and on economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, as well as the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are
beyond our control.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future
debt or equity financings will be available to us to pay our debt, including payments due under the Notes and the
Guarantees, or to fund our other capital requirements or any operating losses. If our future cash flows from
operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities) are insufficient
to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital;

- restructure or refinance all or part of our debt, including the Notes and the 2019 Syndicated Facilities, on
or before maturity; or

- forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

We can provide no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of can
be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale will be
acceptable.

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies and are dependent upon cash flow from_**
**_subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies with limited business operations and are dependent
upon the receipt of sufficient funds from their subsidiaries in the form of dividends or distributions to meet their
obligations, including obligations under the Notes and Guarantees, as applicable. The amounts of dividends and
distributions available to each holding company will depend upon the profitability and cash flows of its
subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law.

Although the Indenture will restrict the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries from entering into certain future
consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant
qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. However, various agreements governing our debt may restrict
the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject
such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will
be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or as loans or as payments under profit
and loss pooling agreements, or even prevent such payments. In addition, financial assistance or corporate benefit
restrictions may prevent upstream payments being made to the Issuer by its subsidiaries to enable the Issuer to
service its obligations under the Notes. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no
obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their
respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, have sufficient resources to
meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted
group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.


-----

**_We may not be able to refinance maturing debt on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously_**
**_benefited or on terms that are acceptable to us or at all._**

Our ability to refinance our debt depends on a number of factors, including the liquidity and capital conditions in
the credit markets, and we may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, or at all. In the event that we cannot
refinance our debt, we may not to be able to meet our debt repayment obligations. In addition, the terms of any
refinancing indebtedness may be materially more burdensome to us than the indebtedness it refinances. Such
terms, including additional restrictions on our operations and higher interest rates, could have an adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, our inability to meet repayment obligations under the existing agreements could trigger various
cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, resulting in the acceleration of a substantial portion (if not all) of
our debt, including the Notes, and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We are subject to currency and interest rate risks._**

We are also subject to interest rate risks as we have certain interest determined on a variable basis, either through
unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts. Our obligations under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities
are indexed to variable rates and expose us to direct interest rate risks that could lead to a material increase in our
obligations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will, or will be able to, hedge our full exposure or that
our hedging transactions will be effective. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves
investment techniques and risks different from those associated with our ordinary business. Depending on market
conditions and movements in interest rates, our use of hedging transactions could enhance or harm our overall
performance compared to our competitors. In addition, are subject to the creditworthiness of the counterparties
under our hedging transactions, and we will be exposed to the risk of insolvency or default on the part of our
hedge counterparties. We are subject to certain limited currency exchange rate risks because a majority of our
revenues and operating expenses are paid in currencies other than the pound sterling, including euros, U.S. dollars,
and the Malaysian ringgit. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations for Synthomer—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk.”_

**_We are subject to credit risks._**

We are exposed to various credit risks and other financial risks that may have a negative impact on our operating
results. Due to the nature of our operations, we are creditors to numerous counterparties, including our customers,
investments in joint ventures, which subjects us to credit risk associated with those counterparties. These
contractual arrangements, deposits or other financial instruments expose us to credit risk on the amounts due from
such counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk could materially affect our financial condition and results of
operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
_Synthomer—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES AND THE GUARANTEES**

**_The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of our_**
**_non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Only the Guarantors will provide the Guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the Notes on the Issue Date.
Other subsidiaries of the Issuer may guarantee the Notes in the future, but until then, any claim by us or any of
our creditors, including the holders of the Notes, against any such non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally
subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. The Indenture will not limit the transfer of assets
to, or the making of investments in, any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein), including our
subsidiaries that do not provide guarantees for the Notes, which subsidiaries could account for a higher portion of
our assets, liabilities, revenues and net results in the future.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Guarantors generated 69.7% of our unaudited pro forma EBITDA.
As of December 31, 2019, the Guarantors accounted for 56.2% of our total assets, with our total assets calculated
in this instance as the sum of the total assets of Synthomer as of December 31, 2019 and the total assets of
OMNOVA as of November 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, on an as adjusted pro forma basis giving effect


-----

to the Transactions, the Issuer’s direct and indirect subsidiaries that do not Guarantee the Notes would have had
debts outstanding in the amount of £0 million. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of
any of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to
payment in full from their respective assets before the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is entitled to receive any
distribution from such assets as equity holders. Except to the extent that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors may
itself be a creditor with recognized claims against a non-guarantor subsidiary, claims of creditors of such nonguarantor subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims
of the Issuer or the Guarantors as equity holders, although there is no assurance that the claims of the Issuer or
any of the Guarantors as a creditor against a non-guarantor subsidiary may not be reduced, limited, subordinated
or extinguished as a result of applicable insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of equitable subordination or the
rules regarding the potential avoidance of transactions concluded with related persons within a certain hardening
period). Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business, which liabilities are also effectively senior to the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors will have priority with respect to their collateral_**
**_over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets_**
**_securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets. As a result,
claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors will have priority with respect to the assets securing
their indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness
or other obligations (except to the extent such assets in the future also secure the Notes and the Guarantees on an
equal and rateable basis or priority basis). In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at a
time when it has secured obligations, holders of secured indebtedness will have priority claims to the assets of the
Issuer or such Guarantor that constitute their collateral (other than to the extent such assets in the future also secure
the Notes and the Guarantees on an equal and rateable basis). The holders of the Notes will participate rateably
with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and potentially with all their other
respective general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be. The claims of holders of the Notes and other unsecured
creditors will also depend on whether there is any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets.
If any of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed
against the operating assets that secure such indebtedness, our assets remaining after repayment of that secured
indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders of
Notes may receive less, rateably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer or the Guarantors.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade by at
least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., provided at
such time no default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants will be suspended for
the duration of the period during which the Notes maintain an investment grade rating and include covenants that
restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, to incur debt and to enter into certain other transactions.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment
grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. Suspension of these covenants, however, would allow us to engage
in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force, and such transactions will
not result in a breach of the Indenture if the Notes fail to maintain an investment grade rating. See “Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”_

**_Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes._**

The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as more fully described in “Description of the Notes.” In
the event that the Issuer exercises the option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer a lower than
expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.


-----

**_Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_**
**_or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limit validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However,
the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor,
voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantor to incur
personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses and laws. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit and
uncommercial transactions, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, transaction at undervalue,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no
liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and
applicable law. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending
on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general under bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance
and similar laws in England and Wales, Germany Italy and Malaysia, Guarantees can be challenged and a court
could (i) declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void any legal act
performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Guarantees) and/or subordinate
the Guarantee, (ii) require, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee, that the recipient (and possibly,
subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor and (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found, inter alia, that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference over another when the
Guarantors contemplated filing for insolvency or the Guarantors subsequently entered an insolvency
process or when the recipient was (or should have been) aware that the Guarantor was insolvent or it
would be rendered insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or consideration of equivalent value in money or money’s
worth or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of
the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity;

- the Guarantor incurred debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature;

- the relevant Guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency varies depending in the law applied, see “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability
_Considerations.”_

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee
not constituting a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.” However,
we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at
the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was
insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.


-----

If a court decided that a guarantee or payment under a guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance and voided such guarantee or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any
claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any
other Guarantor under the relevant guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is
invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations
apply, the Notes, would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and if we cannot
satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can repay in full the amounts outstanding
under the Notes.

These or similar laws may also apply to any other guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries under the Indenture.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts could limit the enforceability of any
Guarantee against any Guarantor. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

**_The granting of the Guarantees or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart_**
**_hardening periods and the Guarantees may be challenged or voidable in accordance with the laws applicable_**
**_in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of Guarantees may create hardening periods for such Guarantees in certain jurisdictions. The
applicable hardening period for new Guarantees would typically run from the moment each new Guarantee has
been granted or perfected and/or any new indebtedness guaranteed by such Guarantee has been incurred.

The Guarantees may be voidable by the relevant Guarantors or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or
administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances
exist or occur, including, amongst others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the
grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an
insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified hardening period
following the grant. At each time, if a Guarantee is to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
period applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible
to enforce it. To the extent that any Guarantee is voided, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of such
Guarantee. The holders of the Notes may also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such
Guarantee or release such Guarantee.

In order to effectively secure future indebtedness, including additional Notes under the Indenture it may be
necessary to create additional Guarantees or amend the relevant Guarantee at the time such indebtedness is
incurred. Any such Guarantee or amendments and any Guarantee in relation to any future indebtedness will likely
be subject to new hardening periods and, consequently, to potential insolvency challenges as described under
“Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

If the Issuer issues additional notes with the same securities identification numbers as the Notes offered hereby, a
receiver, insolvency administrator or similar person may seek to challenge the enforceability of the Guarantees
securing both the additional notes and the initial Notes even if the hardening period with respect to the Guarantees
securing the initial Notes has expired, based on the fact that the initial Notes and the additional notes are fungible
and not distinguishable. Any such successful challenge would further reduce the proceeds available to the holders
of the Notes.

**_Corporate benefit and financial assistance laws and other limitations on the obligations under the Guarantees_**
**_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees._**

The Guarantees for the Notes provide the holders of the Notes with a right of recourse against the assets of the
relevant Guarantors. Each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates
to that Guarantor, unlawful, voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, i.e., to the extent that the grant
or the enforcement of the Guarantee, would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws
or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene its duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to
contravene any legal prohibition. Enforcement of the obligations under the Notes against the Issuer and
enforcement of a guarantee against a Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, or, in some cases, to limitations designed to ensure full compliance with


-----

statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, voidable preference, unfair consideration, corporate
benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more
of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Issuer or a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability
under the Notes or its Guarantee or the Guarantees may be unenforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor
of a Guarantor or the bankruptcy trustee, in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and
enforceability of the Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited
or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is no longer valid or enforceable, in whole or in part, the Notes would
effectively be subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such
Guarantor. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” in relation to the Issuer.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer is required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding
Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any. If a change of control were to occur, we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to pay
the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with similar provisions.

In addition, our other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to certain
events or transactions that could constitute a “change of control” under the terms of the Indenture and the 2019
Syndicated Facilities Agreement. The inability to purchase the Notes or repay the 2019 Syndicated Facilities upon
the occurrence of a change of control would constitute an event of default under the terms and conditions
governing the Notes and the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, which would trigger a cross-default under the
Notes and vice versa. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control.”

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. In addition, the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and Wales,
the United States, the jurisdiction of incorporation or the center of main interest of a Guarantor or in more than
one such jurisdiction. Any multi-jurisdictional proceeding is likely to be complex and costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under
the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws, and there
can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany, and
Malaysia may be materially different from, or be in conflict with those of the United States and other jurisdictions
with which you may be familiar, including in the areas of the rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings. The application of
these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should
apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in the relevant
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of incorporation of certain Guarantors may limit the ability of those Guarantors to guarantee debt of
other companies. As a result, a court in those jurisdictions may deem the Guarantees to be invalid or reduce the
amount of guaranteed obligations available to satisfy claims under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency and
_Enforceability Considerations.”_

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. It is anticipated that some or all of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will be non-residents of the United States


-----

and that some or all of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or its or their
respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon
civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. As a result, service of process within the United States upon
the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their directors and executive officers, or enforcement against them,
judgements of U.S. courts would be possible only under certain conditions. In addition, neither the Issuer nor the
Guarantors assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be
enforceable in any of the above mentioned jurisdictions, other than the United States of America. There is also
doubt that a court in any of the above mentioned foreign jurisdictions would have the requisite power or authority
to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such foreign jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities
laws violations. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as_**
**_those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdictions the insolvency or similar
proceedings would first be commenced or how these proceedings would be resolved. Proceedings could be
initiated in England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia, or any other relevant jurisdiction,
and your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the
bankruptcy laws of the United States, or certain other jurisdictions you may be familiar with, and there can be no
assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency
or other proceedings. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and of
the Guarantors’ (excluding OMNOVA Solutions, Inc.) jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of
the rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest
and the duration of the proceeding.

The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the
Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Insolvency and
_Enforceability Considerations—Italy—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Considerations” with respect to certain_
of the jurisdictions listed above.

Accordingly, and assuming that the Issuer’s and the English Guarantors’ centers of main interests (within the
meaning of Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 20 May 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) are in the jurisdiction of their
incorporation, provided that there is no change to the situation of the Guarantors’ centers of main interests and
that the Guarantors have no establishments elsewhere (assuming that the centers of main interests are located in a
jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable), insolvency proceedings with respect to any of
those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, the insolvency law in the jurisdiction of their
incorporation (although this could be challenged and secondary/ancillary proceedings could be opened in other
jurisdictions). English, Italian, German and Malaysian insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as the
laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any one or more
of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Further, the location of a company’s center of main interests and
its other establishments is a question of fact and may change. To the extent any of the Issuer or the Guarantors
has a center of main interests or an establishment that is outside of the law of their respective incorporation, other
jurisdictions’ insolvency laws may become relevant. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

The EU Insolvency Regulation includes, among others, specifications regarding the identification of the center of
main interests. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company
or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to


-----

the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member
State within a three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it
should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member
State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special
consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration
of its interests.

The U.K. has withdrawn from the EU and has commenced negotiations with the EU to enter into a new trade
agreement and is in a transition period until December 31, 2020 (subject to the possibility of an extension by up
to two years). The terms on which the U.K. will exit the EU are not certain and therefore it is not possible to know
at this stage what impact the exit by the U.K. from the EU will have on the application of EU law (including the
EU Insolvency Regulation) to, or in connection with, any insolvency proceedings (including, without limitation,
the commencement of such insolvency proceedings and the jurisdiction of the U.K. courts to open such insolvency
proceedings) to which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors may be subject. See “—Enforcing your rights as a
_holder of the Notes may prove difficult.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks
related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors
that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions._**

The Issuer has not agreed to register and does not intend to register the Notes under the Securities Act or any
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not offer
to sell the Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United
States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the
future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes under any other
country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion in the section entitled
“Notice to Investors” for further information about these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors
in the Notes to ensure that their subscription for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with
any applicable securities laws.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if our creditworthiness worsens._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives us to be less likely to fully perform all obligations
under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the materialization of any of the
risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section. Even if our ability to fully perform all obligations under the Notes when
they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception. In
addition, market participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors
operating in the same business as us could adversely change, causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If any
of these events occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the
materialization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could decrease.


-----

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able_**
**_to sell them._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the Notes
to be admitted to the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, but cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of the holders of the Notes to sell such Notes or the price at which they may be
able to sell such Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Notes depend on many factors, including, among
other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar securities and general economic
conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing
the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do so. Any market-making that is commenced may be halted at
any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our financial
performance in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading market in the
Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Notes. As a result, we cannot ensure that an active
trading market will actually develop for the Notes.

Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject to similar
disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of our financial
performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes. In addition, the Indenture
will allow us to issue Additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes.

**_The Notes may not remain listed on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM._**

Although we intend to maintain the listing of the Notes on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, as long as the
Notes are outstanding, we cannot assure prospective investors that the Notes will remain listed. If we cannot
maintain the listing of the Notes on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain
such listing, we may cease to maintain such listing on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, provided that we will
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of the Notes on another “recognised stock exchange”
(within the meaning of Section 1005 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007) or their admission to trading on a
multilateral trading facility (within the meaning of Section 987 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007) which is
operated by a recognised stock exchange regulated in the EEA (or, following the expiration of the Brexit
transitional period, regulated in the U.K., EEA or Gibraltar), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer
will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the
London Stock Exchange’s ISM or a recognised stock exchange, or of admission to trading on a multilateral trading
facility operated by a recognised stock exchange regulated in the EEA, for high yield issuers in accordance with
the Indenture, the delisting of the Notes from the London Stock Exchange’s ISM or another stock exchange in
accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the
secondary market.

**_Prospective investors may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If prospective investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange related risks due
to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro, relative to the currency by reference
to which such prospective investors measure their returns because of economic, political or other factors over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro, against the currency by reference to which prospective
investors measure their respective investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return of the Notes is translated
into the currency by reference to which such investors measure their investment returns. There may be tax
consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in
the Notes. See “Tax Considerations.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or the holders of the Notes.
The nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole holder of the global notes


-----

representing the Notes. After payment to Euroclear or Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for
the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.

Accordingly, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, and if it is not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through
which it owns its interest, to exercise any rights and obligations as a holder of the Notes. See “Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form.” Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any_
direct rights to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from the holders of
the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or if applicable, from a participant in these
systems. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient
to enable investors to vote on any matters or otherwise exercise their rights with respect to the Notes on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in
respect of all book-entry interests, if an investor owns a book-entry interest it will be restricted to acting through
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. We can provide no assurance that the procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of the investors’
rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may be risks related to payments made by an Italian resident guarantor._**

There is no authority directly regarding the Italian tax regime of payments on notes made by an Italian resident
guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative
treatment of such payments than that set forth herein.

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Italian resident noteholders by an Italian resident guarantor, in
accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any such payments may be subject to Italian withholding
tax at the rate of 26% levied as a final tax or a provisional tax (“a titolo d’imposta” or “a titolo di acconto”)
depending on the “status” of the noteholder, pursuant to Presidential Decree 29 September 1973, No. 600, as
subsequently amended. In the case of payments to non-Italian resident noteholders, the withholding tax should be
final. Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may apply allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate
of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian residents, subject to compliance with relevant subjective
and procedural requirements.

In accordance with another interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident guarantor should be
treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the relevant Issuer.

**_The independent auditors reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP included in this Offering Memorandum_**
**_include statements purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such report and the opinions contained_**
**_therein._**

In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, each of the
independent auditors reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP states: “This report, including the opinions, has
been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.” Prospective investors in the Notes should
understand that in making these statements, the independent auditors confirmed that they do not accept or assume
any responsibility to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to Synthomer’s members as a body
with respect to their reports and to the independent auditors audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit
such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an
offering of securities registered under the Securities Act or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S.
court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes
may have against the independent auditors based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it
relates could be limited.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering to be €520,000,000 (assuming the Notes are issued at par).

On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay
the Bridge Facilities and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the Offering

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds relating to the Offering. Actual amounts
are subject to adjustment and may differ significantly from estimated amounts, depending on several factors,
including the amount of accrued interest, fluctuations in the exchange rates among the euro and the pound sterling
and applicable break costs on the date of repayment of our debt and differences from our estimates of fees and
expenses.

Group. We intend to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Facilities Agreement, together with any accrued and

unpaid interest, on or about the Issue Date with the proceeds from this Offering.

(3) Represents our estimate of the fees and expenses in connection with or otherwise related to the Offering, fluctuations in the exchange

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization, along with our consolidated cash and cash
equivalents, as of March 31, 2020:

(a) on a historical basis;

(b) on an unaudited _pro forma combined basis to give effect to the Acquisition and Related Financing_
(referred to as “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined before the Refinancing” in the table below);
and

(c) on an unaudited pro forma combined basis to give effect to the Transactions (referred to as “Unaudited
_Pro Forma Condensed Combined Total” in the table below);_

as if the Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2020.

This table is subject to the various assumptions regarding amounts as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” The
historical consolidated financial information of Synthomer has been derived from the Synthomer Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited pro
_forma combined cash and cash equivalents and capitalization data before the Refinancing and the unaudited pro_
_forma combined total cash and cash equivalents data have been derived from the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
Combined Financial Information presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following section presents Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and should be_
_read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Use of Proceeds,”_
_“Capitalization,” “Selected Financial Information—Synthomer,” “Selected Financial Information—_
_OMNOVA,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for_
_Synthomer,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for_
_OMNOVA” as well as the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements and the OMNOVA Consolidated_
_Financial Statements appearing elsewhere herein._

_The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information in respect of the Enlarged Group includes_
_the 2019 Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Interim Income Statement” and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet. The_
_Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements have been prepared giving effect to the_
_Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2019. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Balance Sheet has been prepared giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March_
_31, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is based on available_
_information and various assumptions that management believe to be reasonable. The Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Financial Information includes unaudited pro forma adjustments that are factually_
_supportable and directly attributable to the Transactions. In addition, with respect to the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Income Statements, the unaudited pro forma adjustments are expected to have a continuing_
_impact on the consolidated income statements of Synthomer._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum_
_has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended_
_December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS and the unaudited consolidated interim financial_
_statements of Synthomer as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 prepared in accordance with IAS_
_34, appearing elsewhere herein._

_In addition the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information presented in this Offering_
_Memorandum has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of OMNOVA as of November_
_30, 2018 and 2019 and for each of the financial years ended November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 prepared in_
_accordance with US GAAP and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of OMNOVA as of and_
_for the three months ended February 29, 2020 prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial_
_statements._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is prepared, unless otherwise specified,_
_on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of Synthomer consolidated_
_financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The OMNOVA consolidated financial_
_statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The unaudited pro forma financial information relating_
_to OMNOVA reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been derived_
_through unaudited pro forma adjustments from the OMNOVA consolidated financial statements prepared in_
_accordance with US GAAP and adjusted, as applicable, to IFRS and the accounting policies as applied by_
_Synthomer._

_We have assessed the OMNOVA financial information to identify any material differences between IFRS and US_
_GAAP. Unaudited pro forma adjustments from this assessment are presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma_
_Condensed Combined Financial Information; however, we have not attempted to quantify all differences that_
_would have been identified if the historical OMNOVA financial information had been prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the adjustments described in the notes to the Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information are a complete summary of all the differences that would_
_result had a full IFRS conversion been prepared. Had such a conversion been made, other accounting and_
_disclosure differences may have come to our attention that are not identified in the notes to the Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information, some of which may be material._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has been prepared on the basis that the_
_Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to IFRS, which requires_
_the recognition and measurement of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value as_


-----

_at the date control is obtained and the purchase price. The purchase accounting adjustments to record the assets_
_and liabilities at fair value have not yet been finalized. The fair value adjustments, when finalized, may be_
_material._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been adjusted to reflect any_
_matters not directly attributable to implementing the Transactions. No adjustment, therefore, has been made for_
_any of the integration plans related to the Acquisition._

_The actual financial results may differ materially from those reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed_
_Combined Financial Information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the_
_assumptions used to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and actual_
_amounts. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is provided for illustrative_
_purposes and as supplemental information to facilitate management discussion and analysis and does not purport_
_to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred_
_on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial_
_position at any future date._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information set forth in this Offering Memorandum_
_is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may_
_differ materially from the actual amounts that would have been achieved had the Transactions occurred on the_
_respective dates mentioned above._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information does not include all information required_
_for financial statements under IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the Synthomer Consolidated_
_Financial Statements and OMNOVA Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures such as unaudited pro forma borrowings and unaudited_
_pro forma EBITDA because we believe they are important supplementary measures and that they are widely used_
_by investors comparing performance between companies. Since not all companies compute these non-IFRS_
_financial measures in the same way, the manner in which our management has chosen to compute the non-IFRS_
_financial measures presented herein may not be comparable with similarly defined terms used by other companies._
_These measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as_
_alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance_
_derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to_
_incur or service debt._

_The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance_
_with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospective Regulation or any_
_generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the_
_resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information have been audited or reviewed in_
_accordance with any generally accepted audited standards. Any information you place on this information should_
_fully take this into consideration._

consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS and

included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The historical financial information of Synthomer for the three months ended March

31, 2020 has been derived from the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the three months

ended March 31, 2020 (with unaudited comparative financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2019), which are

prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(2) **OMNOVA**

**For the year ended November 30, 2019 and the three months ended February 29, 2020**

The following tables present a reconciliation of the historical financial information of OMNOVA for each of the year ended November

30, 2019 and the three months ended February 29, 2020, both prepared in accordance with US GAAP and presented in US dollars to the

unaudited pro forma financial information of OMNOVA for each of the year ended November 30, 2019 and the three months ended

February 29, 2020 respectively, prepared in accordance with IFRS as applied by Synthomer and presented in pounds sterling.


-----

The US GAAP to IFRS adjustments represent the material adjustments that are required to convert the financial information of

OMNOVA to IFRS as applied by Synthomer, including any material accounting policy alignments, as well as reclassifications to

conform to Synthomer’s presentation.

We have not attempted to quantify all differences that would have been identified if the historical OMNOVA financial information had

been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the adjustments described in the notes below are a

complete summary of all the differences that would result had a full IFRS conversion been prepared.

(a) The historical financial information of OMNOVA for the year ended November 30, 2019 has been derived from OMNOVA’s

audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2019, which are prepared in accordance with

US GAAP and included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The historical financial information of OMNOVA for the three months ended February 29, 2020 has been derived from

OMNOVA’s unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended February 29, 2020, which are

prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial statements and included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(b) This reflects OMNOVA’s consolidated income statement for each of the year ended November 30, 2019 and the three months

ended February 29, 2020 represented to conform to line item presentation format. Certain line items have been aggregated or

disaggregated to align them with Synthomer’s income statement presentation

(c) Certain IFRS adjustments and reclassifications were made to reflect the difference in accounting policies under Synthomer’s IFRS

accounting policies, as opposed to US GAAP as applied by OMNOVA. The material unaudited adjustments are as follows:

(1) For the year ended November 30, 2019, OMNOVA accounted for leases under ASC 840 whereby operating lease expenses

are recorded on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term, including any optional renewal terms that are

reasonably expected to be exercised, and capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of

future minimum lease payments with a corresponding amount recorded in property, plant, and equipment. Synthomer has

adopted IFRS 16 Leases with effect from January 1, 2019 which requires to recognize lease liabilities in relation to leases

which had previously been classified as operating leases. Under IFRS, these liabilities are measured at the present value of

the remaining lease payments, discounted using each lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. Adjustments have been made to

reflect the effect of the differences on operating profit/(loss) – underlying performance of $0.8 million and interest element

of lease payments of $(0.5) million for the year ended November 30, 2019.

Effective from December 31, 2019, OMNOVA has adopted ASC 842 which requires a lessee to recognize on the balance

sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with a lease term of more than twelve

months. Leases have continued to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition,


-----

measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease with effect from December 1, 2019.

Adjustments to operating profit/(loss) – underlying performance of $0.1 million and interest element of lease payments of

$(0.1) million have been made to reflect the presentational differences related to leases between US GAAP and IFRS for the

three months ended February 29, 2020.

(2) Under US GAAP, the OMNOVA Group has historically accounted for the US produced inventory under the last-in-first-out

(“LIFO”) method. The LIFO method of accounting is not permitted under IFRS. Consequently, adjustments have been made

to measure inventory in accordance with Synthomer’s accounting policies under IFRS, resulting in an adjustment to operating

profit/(loss) – underlying performance of $(3.0) million and $0.5 million for each of the year ended November 30, 2019 and

the three months ended February 29, 2020, respectively.

(3) Under US GAAP, the OMNOVA Group has elected to record the effects of remeasurements (which include actuarial gains/

losses) immediately in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and to subsequently amortize them in the income statement.

Under IFRS, these gains/losses are recognized immediately in OCI and are not subsequently recycled through the income

statement. In addition, US GAAP requires an independent calculation of interest cost (based on the application of a discount

rate to the projected benefit obligation) and expected return on assets (based on the application of an expected rate of return

on assets to the calculated asset value). Under IFRS a discount rate is applied to the net benefit obligation to calculate a single

net interest cost or income. An adjustment has been made to reflect the effect of the differences on operating profit/(loss) –

underlying performance of $(1.9) million and $(0.6) million for each of the year ended November 30, 2019 and the three

months ended February 29, 2020, respectively, and net interest expense on defined benefit obligation of $(2.2) million and

$(0.6) million for each of the year ended November 30, 2019 and the three months ended February 29, 2020, respectively.

(4) On March 2, 2018, the OMNOVA Group amended its Term Loan B Agreement and as a result reduced the margins for

borrowings under the Term Loan B Agreement by 100 basis points to 3.25% for Eurodollar rate loans and 2.25% for base

rate loans. Under both US GAAP and IFRS this amendment is accounted for as a modification. When accounting for a

modification, under US GAAP, reductions in future margin payments are recorded on an accruals basis, and a new effective

interest rate is calculated using the new contractual cash flows. Under IFRS, a modification gain or loss is immediately

recognized in the income statement. The gain or loss is determined by recalculating the gross carrying amount of the financial

liability by discounting the new contractual cash flows using the original effective interest rate. An adjustment have been

made to interest payable of $(2.0) million and $(0.5) million to reflect the effect of the unwind of the modification gain on

interest payable for each of the year ended 30 November 2019 and the three months ended February 29, 2020, respectively.

(5) For the financial year ended November 30, 2019 the OMNOVA Group established a valuation allowance of $43.5 million

on its deferred tax assets and for the three months ended February 29, 2020 established a valuation allowance of $43.4 million

on its deferred tax assets. The tax impact on the adjustments above is offset by the opposite adjustment in the deferred tax

asset valuation allowance, which results in nil tax impact on net earnings for each the year ended November 30, 2019 and the

three months ended February 29, 2020.

(d) The OMNOVA financial information for the year ended November 30, 2019 has been converted from US dollars to pounds sterling

using the average exchange rate for the year ended November 30, 2019 of £1.00 = $1.2746. The OMNOVA financial information

for the three months ended February 29, 2020 has been converted from US dollars to pounds sterling using the average exchange

rate for the three months ended February 29, 2020 of £1.00 =$1.3015.

**_As of February 29, 2020_**

The following table presents a reconciliation of the historical financial information of OMNOVA as of February 29, 2020 prepared in

accordance with US GAAP for interim financial statements and presented in U.S. dollars to the unaudited _pro forma financial_

information of OMNOVA as of February 29, 2020 prepared in accordance with IFRS as applied by Synthomer and presented in pounds

sterling.

The US GAAP to IFRS adjustments represent the material adjustments that are required to convert the financial information of

OMNOVA to IFRS as applied by Synthomer, including any material accounting policy alignments, as well as reclassifications to

conform to Synthomer’s presentation.

We have not attempted to quantify all differences that would have been identified if the historical OMNOVA financial information had

been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the adjustments described in the notes below are a

complete summary of all the differences that would result had a full IFRS conversion been prepared.

(a) The historical financial information of OMNOVA as at February 29, 2020 has been derived from OMNOVA’s unaudited

consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended February 29, 2020, which are prepared in accordance with

US GAAP for interim financial statements and included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(b) This reflects OMNOVA’s consolidated balance sheet as at February 29, 2020 represented to conform to Synthomer’s line item

presentation format. Certain line items have been aggregated or disaggregated to align them with Synthomer’s income statement

presentation.

(c) Certain IFRS adjustments and reclassifications were made to reflect the difference in accounting policies under Synthomer’s IFRS

accounting policies, as opposed to US GAAP as applied by OMNOVA. The material unaudited adjustments are as follows:

(1) Under US GAAP, OMNOVA includes finance lease obligations in within “borrowings” line item. Presentational

reclassifications of $0.8 million from current borrowings to short term lease obligations and of $14.0 million from non-current

borrowings to non-current lease liabilities have been made to reflect Synthomer’s accounting policy under IFRS to reflect

the finance lease obligations within “lease liabilities” line item.

(2) Under US GAAP, OMNOVA has historically accounted for the US produced inventory under the LIFO method. The LIFO

method of accounting is not permitted under IFRS. Consequently, an adjustment of $15.6 million has been made to measure

inventory in accordance with Synthomer’s accounting policies under IFRS, resulting in an adjustment on inventory and total

equity as of February 29, 2020.

(3) Under US GAAP, OMNOVA has elected to record the effects of remeasurements (which include actuarial gains/ losses)

immediately in OCI and to subsequently amortize them in the income statement. Under IFRS, these gains/losses are

recognized immediately in OCI and are not subsequently recycled through the income statement. In addition, US GAAP

requires an independent calculation of interest cost (based on the application of a discount rate to the projected benefit

obligation) and expected return on assets (based on the application of an expected rate of return on assets to the calculated

asset value). Under IFRS a discount rate is applied to the net benefit obligation to calculate a single net interest cost or income.

An adjustment of $26.0 million has been made to reflect the effect of the differences on retirement benefit obligations and

total equity as of February 29, 2020.

(4) On March 2, 2018, the OMNOVA Group amended its Term Loan B Agreement and as a result reduced the margins for

borrowings under the Term Loan B Agreement by 100 basis points to 3.25% for Eurodollar rate loans and 2.25% for base

rate loans. Under both US GAAP and IFRS this amendment is accounted for as a modification. When accounting for a

modification, under US GAAP, reductions in future margin payments are recorded on an accruals basis, and a new effective

interest rate is calculated using the new contractual cash flows. Under IFRS, a modification gain or loss is immediately

recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss is determined by recalculating the gross carrying amount of the financial

liability by discounting the new contractual cash flows using the original effective interest rate. An adjustment of $8.1 million

has been made to reflect the effect of the modification to the non-current borrowings and total equity as of February 29, 2020.

(5) For the financial year ended November 30, 2019 the OMNOVA Group established a valuation allowance of $43.5 million

on its deferred tax assets and for the three months ended February 29, 2020 established a valuation allowance of $43.4 million

on its deferred tax assets. The tax impact on the adjustments above is offset by the opposite adjustment in the deferred tax

asset valuation allowance, which results in nil tax impact on net earnings for each the year ended November 30, 2019 and the

three months ended February 29, 2020.

(d) The OMNOVA financial information has been converted from US dollars to pounds sterling using the closing exchange rate as at

February 29, 2020 of £1.00 =$1.2823.

(3) **Acquisition and Related Financing adjustments:**

**For the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2020**

The Acquisition and Related Financing adjustments, where necessary, are translated from U.S. dollars to pounds sterling using the

average exchange rate for the year ended November 30, 2019 of £1.00 =$1.2746, the average exchange rate for the three months ended

February 29, 2020 of £1.00 =$1.3015 and include:

Facilities.......................................................................................................................................... (19.2) (5.1)

**_Pro forma finance costs adjustment ..............................................................................................._** 1.4 (0.6)

In addition, there are non-recurring items directly attributable to the Acquisition which relate to professional and legal fees and other

Acquisition related costs (recorded within “Special Items” line item) as well as share based payment costs for OMNOVA executives

who left the business on completion of the Acquisition (recorded within “Company and subsidiaries before Special Items” line item).

Such non-recurring items are adjusted in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statements as follows:


**Year ended**

**_Pro forma operating profit/(loss) adjustment ................................................................................._** 20.1 (5.5)

**_As of March 31, 2020_**

The Acquisition and Related Financing adjustments, where necessary, are translated from U.S. dollars to pounds sterling using the

closing exchange rate as of March 31, 2020 of £1.00 = $1.2420 and as of February 29, 2020 of £1.00 = $1.2823 and include:

- The pro forma adjustment to goodwill arising on the Acquisition is calculated as follows:

**(£ in millions)**

Consideration[(a)] ...................................................................................................................................................... 382.3
Less: OMNOVA net liabilities (net assets excluding goodwill) acquired (net book value as of February 29,
2020) (per Note 2 above) ....................................................................................................................................... 41.9
**Goodwill on acquisition of OMNOVA ..............................................................................................................** **424.2**
Less: OMNOVA existing goodwill (as of February 29, 2020) (per Note 2 above) ............................................. (54.1)
**_Pro forma goodwill adjustment ..........................................................................................................................._** **370.1**

(a) Cash consideration is calculated as $10.15 per share for the entire issued share capital of OMNOVA as of April 1, 2020. The

aggregate amount payable for share awards which have vested ahead of completion of the Acquisition is included in the calculation

of consideration where the payment made meets the definition of Acquisition consideration.

The number of shares used for calculating the consideration is determined as of April 1, 2020 and reflect the number of shares

which may be issued as a result of share awards vesting in the period up to April 1, 2020.


-----

- The pro forma adjustment to cash and cash equivalents comprises:


**(£ in millions)**

Cash paid for OMNOVA shares and share awards ............................................................................................ (382.3)
Repayment of Synthomer outstanding borrowings balance under the 2018 Revolving Facility ....................... (106.6)
Repayment of OMNOVA borrowings [(a)] ............................................................................................................ (249.4)
Advisor fees and other Acquisition and Related Financing costs [(b) ] .................................................................. (28.6)
Drawings under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, the Bridge Facilities,
less associated debt issuance costs[(c)] ............................................................................................................... 423.5
**_Pro forma cash and cash equivalents adjustment .........................................................................................._** **(343.4)**

(a) Relates to the repayment of outstanding balances under the Term Loan B ($297.8 million (£232.2 million)) and the Senior Secured

Revolving Credit Facility ($22.0 million (£17.2 million)).

(b) Comprise change in control and retention payments of £12.3 million and Acquisition costs of £16.3 million incurred by the

Enlarged Group (whereby the related accrual reversal as of March 31, 2020 was £2.4 million which have been reflected as a pro

_forma adjustment to trade and other payables). These costs are in addition to the advisor fees and other Acquisition and Related_

Financing costs £16.5 million paid prior to March 31, 2020 These costs also exclude retention payments of £1.3 million ($1.7

million) due to be paid by the Enlarged Group to OMNOVA employees for post-Acquisition services.

(c) Reflects drawings under the 2019 Term Loan Facility of £209.3 million, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility of £130.6 million

which are recognized as non-current borrowings and the Bridge Facilities of £88.2 million recognized as current borrowings. The

associated capitalized debt issuance costs are £4.7 million.

The cash consideration paid for OMNOVA shares and share awards of $475 million (£382.3 million) presented above differs from the

disclosure of cash consideration paid for the entire issued share capital of OMNOVA of $473 million (approximately £375 million) as

at July 3, 2019, discussed elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, due to differences in number of shares used at each respective date

presented.

   - The pro forma adjustments to current and non-current borrowings comprise:

`o` a reduction in Synthomer borrowings of £105.0 million that reflects the repayment of Synthomer outstanding borrowings

balance under the 2018 Revolving Facility of £106.6 million (as per above), offset by related capitalised debt costs of £1.6

million written off upon the repayment of borrowings;

`o` a reduction in OMNOVA borrowings of £239.1 million that reflects the repayment of the principal amount of outstanding

OMNOVA borrowings, of $319.8 million (£249.4 million) (the current portion of that debt is $3.5 million (£2.7 million)),

offset by related capitalized debt costs of ($5.1 million) £4.0 million and debt modification gain of $8.1 million (£6.3 million)

written off upon the repayment of such borrowings; and

`o` an increase in borrowings of £423.5 million that reflects drawings under the 2019 Term Loan Facility, the 2019 Revolving

Credit Facility, the Bridge Facilities of £428.2 million, (including the current portion of £88.2 million), offset by the

capitalized debt issuance costs of £4.7 million.

The pro forma adjustments required in order to give effect of the Refinancing as of March 31, 2020 as follows:

(also refer to “Capitalization”):

`o` the £462.1 million reclassification between current and non-current borrowings represents the repayment of borrowings

balance under the Bridge Facilities of €520 million (£462.1 million) and the assumed issuance of the Notes of €520

million (£462.1 million converted from euro to pounds sterling using the closing exchange rate as of March 31, 2020

Depreciation and amortization ......................................................... 80.5 19.6

**EBITDA[(a)] .........................................................................................** **239.6** **53.7**

(a) EBITDA is defined by Synthomer as an operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items (as defined below)

(b) Special Items means items that are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s performance

would lead to a distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer

are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year. Such items are detailed in the

notes of the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We present this measure as we believe that this non-IFRS measure is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness

and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You should exercise caution in comparing

the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical

tool, and you should not consider them in isolation.

**SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION—SYNTHOMER**

_The following tables present our summary financial information for Synthomer as of and for each of the three_
_years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, as of March 31, 2020 and for each of the three months ended_
_March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020._

_The summary financial data as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been_
_derived from the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS_
_and included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The summary financial data as of March 31, 2020 and for_
_each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 have been derived from the Synthomer_
_Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and are_
_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Interim results are not necessarily reflective of the results that_
_may be expected for any other interim period or the full year._

_The Synthomer unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been calculated_
_by subtracting Synthomer’s unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (derived_
_from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34)_
_from Synthomer’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 (derived from the Synthomer_
_Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS) and then adding Synthomer’s unaudited_
_results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 (derived from the Synthomer Unaudited Interim_
_Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34). The unaudited financial information for_
_the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily_
_representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date and_
_is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting._

_During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have adopted certain accounting standards_
_that may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the_
_adoption of IFRS 16—Leases, IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9—Financial_
_Instruments. As a result, our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum_
_may not be directly comparable between periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”_

_The following tables should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Financial_
_Information for Synthomer,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations for Synthomer” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, each included_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

(1) We have applied IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in our

consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited comparative period as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited financial information as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2018. We have applied IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on our

amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited

comparative period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited

financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(2) We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019, which has had an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income

statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the

modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. As a result, our results as of and for the years

ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 may not be comparable with the information presented as of and for the year ended December 31,

2019.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS FOR SYNTHOMER**

_The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to convey_
_management’s perspective on our operating performance and financial condition during the periods under_
_review. This disclosure is intended to assist readers in understanding and interpreting our consolidated financial_
_information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The discussion should be read in conjunction with_
_the Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements and the Synthomer Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial_
_Statements, including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, The following_
_discussion should also be read in conjunction with and “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and “Selected_
_Financial Information – Synthomer.” We are required to comply with IFRS, and our accounting policies have_
_been established accordingly._

_The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on_
_our current projections and expectations which we consider reasonable about future events. Our actual results_
_may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important_
_factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section in this Offering Memorandum. See “Cautionary Note_
_Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_Unless otherwise indicated or implied by the context, references in this section to “we,” “our” and “us” are to_
_Synthomer, prior to the Acquisition. Certain figures contained in this discussion and analysis of financial_
_condition and results of operations, including financial information, have been subject to rounding adjustments._
_Accordingly, in certain instances, (i) the sum or percentage change of the numbers may not conform exactly with_
_the total figure given; and (ii) the sum of the numbers in a column or row in certain tables may not conform_
_exactly with the total figure given for that column or row._

**OVERVIEW**

We are a speciality chemicals company and one of the world’s leading suppliers of water-based polymers. We
produce innovative formulations to support customers in a range of industries from construction to healthcare.
Our polymers help our customers create new products and enhance the performance of their existing products
across a broad range of end markets such as construction, health and protection, paper, carpet and foam and
functional polymers such as adhesives and textiles. As a global leader in our industry, we strive to produce ecofriendly products that meet the needs of our customers in a sustainable way.

On July 3, 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire OMNOVA for a price of $10.15
per share, representing an enterprise value of $824 million (£654 million). We closed the Acquisition on April 1,
2020. We expect that the Acquisition will provide us with greater scale and a stronger platform from which to
grow, expand and diversify our product portfolio, strengthen our R&D and innovation capabilities, improve our
proximity to our customer base and benefit from synergies. For more information on the Acquisition, see
“Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.” The proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay the Bridge
Facilities, which partially funded the Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DISCUSSED**

The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of March 31,
2020 and for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, all included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum. The discussion below is primarily based on our “Underlying performance,” which
represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special Items.

The definition of Special Items has been consistently applied across the periods presented in this Offering
Memorandum. Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of the business’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure our consolidated
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the business in
the year. The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a more clear indication of
our Underlying performance:

105


-----

- re-structuring and site closure costs;

- sale of a business or significant asset;

- acquisition costs;

- amortization of acquired intangible assets;

- impairment of non-current assets;

- fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments where hedge accounting is not
applied;

- items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature;

- tax impact of above items; and

- settlement of prior period tax issues.

We believe that presenting “Underlying performance” as an alternative performance measure provides additional
clarity for our investors and stakeholders on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses and it is the
primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting.

**PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

Our operating and financial results are affected by a number of factors. These factors have materially influenced
our financial condition and results of operations during the periods under review and are expected to influence
our future financial condition and results of operations. These factors are not exhaustive, and the entirety of this
Offering Memorandum should be reviewed, particularly the “Risk Factors” section.

**_General economic conditions and demand in our end markets_**

The chemicals industry generally and, to a lesser extent, the speciality chemicals segment in which we operate, is
impacted by general economic conditions. Historically, demand has been generally correlated to GDP growth in
our markets both regionally and globally. In particular, the volatility of raw material prices is driven by the
volatility in oil prices, with higher oil prices generally leading to higher costs of raw materials, although some raw
materials are impacted less than others.

We produce a diverse array of product types—NBR, SBR, dispersions and specialities. Our products have
applications in a variety of end markets, including construction and coating, paper, health and protection, paper,
functional polymers and carpet and foam. While the level of demand for each of our product types and in each of
our end markets is affected by factors specific to that product type and that particular end market, certain
overarching global trends have an impact across the product types and end markets. These include demographic
changes such as population growth, longer life expectancies and urbanization as well as the impact of an increasing
global focus on energy conservation and green products. Demand our customers’ end products is also affected by
macroeconomic factors, such as the correlation between demand for construction products and infrastructure
spending and economic conditions. The fluctuations in demand for our customers’ end products in turn affects the
demand for our products. For example, 2019 was a challenging year for our SBR business. A combination of
slower economic activity and ongoing reduction in demand for graphic coated paper substantially depressed
demand for our SBR products. In the absence of growth, our SBR plants ran at lower than anticipated utilization
rates during the year and significant over capacity now exists in the market. An extensive review of our European
SBR network is being undertaken, with the objective of optimizing the network to operate in the most efficient
and effective way.

Demand for our products also varies in the geographic regions that we serve. Historically, demand in Europe and
North America has been driven by changes in demographics, customer requirements for high-quality products
and stringent health and safety regulations. Demand in developing regions has been driven by demographic factors
such as population growth (through a growing middle class, in particular), ongoing industrialization and
urbanization as well as infrastructure spending.

106

**_Raw material prices and product pricing_**

Raw material prices can be volatile and comprise the largest portion of our costs of goods sold, contributing
between approximately 60% and 70% of variable costs for the year ended December 31, 2019. The nature of our
markets, as well as our market positions and differentiated product offerings, allow us to manage the majority of
our exposure to raw material price fluctuations by generally passing through increases in the prices of raw
materials to our customers.

Key raw materials are based on petrochemical feedstocks, predominantly butadiene, styrene, butyl acrylate,
methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile. Many suppliers operate globally with some focusing on a regional
approach. Prices of the majority of raw materials (by cost) are in part dependent on crude oil prices but are also
influenced by supply and demand of each product. Supply contracts are normally entered into on an annual basis
with price adjustments on a monthly basis. We buy raw materials either under these supplier contracts or via the
spot market, depending on which is more favorable.

Substantially all of our customer agreements have no pricing commitment beyond one month, with approximately
one third of our agreements being formulaic with the remainder being generally negotiable on a monthly basis.
As a result, we are generally able to modify the pricing of our products in line with increases in the prices of raw
materials, resulting in corresponding increases in selling prices although there is typically a one month time lag
in our ability to do so.

We do not use commodity derivatives to hedge the risk of fluctuations in raw materials prices and instead rely on
our ability to reflect raw material price volatility in our pricing. However, from time-to-time we enter into swaps
for our raw materials and sell our purchased raw materials to other buyers in order to manage our quantities of
raw materials.

**_Acquisitions and disposals_**

We actively seek opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in businesses operating in similar chemistries and market
segments as well as transformational step change transactions.

We have successfully focused the expansion of our business through the acquisition of complementary, “bolt-on”
speciality chemicals businesses that offer product portfolios based on similar chemical reactions or processes. In
these situations, we can leverage our expertise and existing technical knowledge; the product offerings of these
acquired companies may involve similar raw materials to those we use, involve similar types of chemical process
(such as polymerization of monomer chains) or use processes which result in similar kinds of products to those
we already produce. In addition, we pursue acquisitions to: expand into new geographies; acquire new
technologies; and consolidate our market position in our existing geographic and end markets.

From time to time, we also opportunistically consider investments in larger speciality chemicals companies.
However, the delivery of any such potential acquisitions would be subject to the acquisitions enhancing our overall
value and aligning with our strategic plan.

In June 2016, we completed the acquisition of PAC for $221 million cash consideration. The acquisition
strengthened Synthomer’s position in the performance adhesives and coatings market, offered access to new
product technologies and customers while providing a stronger platform from which to grow in the speciality
coatings market.

In March 2017, we acquired Speciality Additives (formerly Perstorp Oxo Belgium AB) for a cash consideration
of £66.1 million. Speciality Additives was bought to enhance our existing coatings customer base.

In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf for consideration of £25.8 million. The
acquisition of the BASF Pischelsdorf site contributed to our strong overall volume growth during the year by
adding 63,252 tonnes by December 31, 2018.

In July 2019, we announced the Acquisition at a price of $10.15 per OMNOVA Share, representing an enterprise
value of $824 million (£654 million). The cash price valued the entire issued share capital of OMNOVA at $473
million (approximately £375 million) as at July 3, 2019. The Acquisition was completed on April 1, 2020 and has

107


-----

further differentiated and grown our business. We expect to benefit from increased scale, greater customer reach
and strong operational capabilities. The previously reported expected synergies of $29.6 million, with a 50% run
rate at the end of twelve months, is on track with no delays in synergy delivery expected due to COVID-19.

We also evaluate the performance of our existing businesses on a continuing basis and occasionally choose to
divest of certain businesses or assets in order to streamline the business. In June 2018, we reduced our holding in
our UAE asset to meet a contractual commitment with our joint venture partner and in August 2016, we disposed
of our operations in South Africa.

We continued to benefit from the delivery of synergies relating to the PAC dispersion business we acquired from
Hexion in June 2016. The synergies in 2018 largely related to the sale of the Leuna site (Germany) and
commencement of the restructuring and simplification of the Ribécourt site (France). The program at Ribécourt
continued in 2019 and resulted in an additional $2 million of synergies, bringing the total synergies arising out of
the acquisition of PAC to $14 million.

**_Investments_**

Investing in innovation, R&D and operational excellence is important to succeed in the speciality chemicals
industry. As customer needs evolve and the competitive outlook and regulatory environment changes, it is
important to remain agile and to adapt in order to meet market demands. We recognize the importance of
innovation to our success and to that of our customers and we have an impressive track record and pipeline of
new product development through customer-focused R&D. Over the past three years, we have continued to grow
our percentage of sales volume derived from products launched in the previous 5 years, deriving 20%, 21% and
22% of our sales volume from products that were launched in the previous five years in 2017, 2018, and 2019,
respectively. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2019, we introduced 16 new products and since 2016,
we have registered 12 new patents.

With regards to innovation and R&D, we maintain four R&D centers including a new state-of-the-art U.K.
Innovation Centre, as well as R&D centers in Malaysia, Germany and the United States. As of, December 31,
2019, we had 165 full-time employees in R&D.

We also invest in our manufacturing capabilities to raise production capacity, streamline operations and drive cost
efficiency. In this regard, we safely completed the expansion of the 90,000 tonnes Nitrile latex capacity plant at
our Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) manufacturing site on time and on budget in the fourth quarter of 2018. We intend
to add further capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year at the manufacturing site during the second half of 2021.

We commissioned our made-to-order acrylic lines at our manufacturing site in Worms, Germany, adding 36,000
tonnes of incremental capacity, as well as a 12,000 tonnes acrylic dispersions expansion at our Roebuck, U.S.,
manufacturing site to secure access to the North American performance and construction adhesives markets. The
new acrylic lines in Worms were installed at a cost of £30.0 million while the new reactor line in Roebuck was
installed at a cost of $16.0 million. Both of these new lines were commissioned for production in the third quarter
of 2019.

Discipline in capital allocation remains a key focus of ours, with hurdle rates for capital expenditure growth
projects remaining unchanged at a payback of less than five years or a 12% internal rate of return. Recognizing
the very significant investment made in organic growth capital expenditures over the past several years, in 2018,
we amended our long term incentive plan performance criteria to include measurements based on return on
invested capital, thereby ensuring that our management and shareholder delivery expectations are aligned.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations_**

_Translation Effect_

Our reporting and functional currency is the pound sterling, while we generate sales, incur costs and have assets
and liabilities at our various subsidiaries in other currencies, particularly the euro, U.S. dollar and Malaysian
ringgit. Therefore, a weakening of the pound sterling against the euro, U.S. dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result
in an increase in our revenues and costs as reported in pound sterling and, conversely, a strengthening of the pound
sterling against the euro, U.S. dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result in a decrease in our revenues and costs as

108


-----

reported in pound sterling. As many of our operations are in markets other than the U.K., these effects may be
significant. Profit translation exposures from overseas operations are not hedged.

The balance sheets of our overseas subsidiaries may include monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the subsidiary’s reporting currency, which exposes the subsidiaries, and accordingly the
Group, to another type of translation effect. In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies,
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the transaction dates. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in
a foreign currency are not retranslated.

The table below illustrates the effect on the Synthomer consolidated income statement and items for each of the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 which are recognized directly in equity that would result from
reasonably possible movements in euro, U.S. dollar and Malaysian ringgit to pound sterling exchange rates, before
the effect of tax.

_Transactional effects_


Due to the international nature of our operations, we frequently conduct transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency of the entity. Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions and as a result, we may have an
exposure to transactional risks. Our policy is, where practicable, to hedge exposures on monetary assets and
liabilities. In regard to transactions with suppliers and customers in currencies other than the pound sterling, our
policy is to hedge significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at the operating company level using
forward foreign exchange contracts.

_Indebtedness_

The majority of our outstanding indebtedness is denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, serving as
a hedge against our assets denominated in those currencies. The amount of our reported indebtedness is therefore
subject to currency-related fluctuations when translated into pound sterling for inclusion in our financial
statements at period-end exchange rates. Therefore, a weakening of the pound sterling against the euro or U.S.
dollar, for example, will result in an increase in the pound sterling value of our euro or U.S. dollar-denominated
indebtedness while a strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro and the U.S. dollar will result in a
decrease in the pound sterling value of our respective euro or U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness.

As of March 31, 2020, all of our borrowings were denominated in euro, with total borrowings amounting to the
pound sterling equivalent of £502.2 million. As of March 31, 2020, net borrowings amounted to £27.1 million.

**_Environmental Considerations_**

Our results of operations are subject to extensive and continuously evolving environmental laws and regulations.
These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and
disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges and air emissions including greenhouse

109


-----

gases. We have invested, and will continue to invest, financial and technical resources in order to achieve and
maintain compliance with environmental requirements. Environmental considerations can also impact the markets
in which we operate, including our position with respect to our competitors.

The main regulations relating to the safe use of substances and chemicals affecting our industry are the REACH
regulation in the European Union and the TSCA in the United States, which impose significant obligations on the
chemicals industry with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of substances. The
obligations imposed by these and other regulations are expensive and time-consuming and lead to increased
production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. In addition, we may also incur costs in
connection with the restoration and decommissioning of former manufacturing sites.

Environmental regulation and considerations also impact customer demand in the markets in which we operate.
We primarily produce water-based polymers through an emulsion polymerization process, which removes the
requirement for large amounts of organic solvents during production and use. These polymers are made up of
different chemical building blocks (monomers) that lead to the different chemistry platforms in our portfolio. The
resultant water-based systems have very low levels of VOCs, some of which can have harmful effects from a
health and wider environmental impact, making our products more suitable than alternatives that result in higher
levels of VOCs, from the perspective of health and safety and environmental considerations.

**_Product and end market mix_**

We produce and sell a wide range of speciality chemical products in different geographic regions and for a variety
of end markets. Overall, we believe our product mix is well-balanced, with 42.7%, 42.0% and 15.3% of our
worldwide revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated from sales of Performance Elastomers,
Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities, respectively.

The products we offer have applications in a range of end markets. Construction and coating is our largest end
market, with sales to the construction and coating end market constituting 25% of total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Sales to the specialities, health and protection, textiles and adhesives, paper, and carpet and
foam end markets constituted 15%, 23%, 15%, 11% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The composition of our sales to each end market is affected by market dynamics, whether
due to long-term end market trends, such as the growth in the Nitrile disposable glove market, evolving customer
needs or due to competitive pressure. The demands for our products in the end markets we serve are also affected
by overarching factors such as demographic changes such as population growth, urbanization and an ageing
population as well as the impact of an increasing global focus on energy conservation and green products.

We produce and sell a wide range of speciality chemical products in different geographic regions and for a variety
of end sectors. Overall, our Board believe our product mix is well-balanced.

To maintain an appropriate product mix for each market, we continue to monitor and respond to industry trends
and market developments, in order to tailor our R&D processes to develop innovative products and solutions that
anticipate market and customer needs, and to acquire and integrate companies that complement our existing
product mix.

**_Seasonality_**

Our operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in demand as customers in many of the end markets we serve
slow down operations during certain months of the year. These fluctuations affect both our sales volumes and the
prices of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing processes. Generally, and absent the impact of COVID19, we expect approximately 55% of our Underlying operating profit to be generated in the first half of each
calendar year, and approximately 45% of our Underlying operating profit to be generated in the second half of
each calendar year due to the slowdown around the summer holidays in July and August and the Christmas
holidays in December. Changes in demand based on seasonal fluctuations can also affect our working capital
requirements, which represent approximately 10% of annual sales. We continually monitor seasonal changes in
demand in order to mitigate possible effects on our business.

**FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

As a result of certain events, such as adoption of material new accounting standards and amendments or major
acquisitions and disposals, year-on-year comparisons of financial results may not be fully comparable. Our
revenue, operating profit and other financial results may be affected by such factors as changes in accounting
standards or changes in the scope of our business between financial periods.

**_Changes to Accounting Standard—IFRS 16 (Leases)_**

The Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On
January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November
9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases
being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under
the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay
lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 is effective for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2019.

We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) with effect from January 1, 2019 but have not restated comparatives for the 2018
reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard. The reclassifications and
the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognized in the opening balance sheet on
January 1, 2019.

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, we have used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:

- reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous;

- the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at January 1,
2019 as short-term leases;

- the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application; and

- the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

_Adjustments recognized on adoption of IFRS 16_

We have a portfolio of leases mainly comprising land and buildings, chemical storage tanks and vehicles. On
adoption of IFRS 16, we recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as
operating leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the
remaining lease payments, discounted using each lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The
weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities in the balance sheet at initial adoption
on January 1, 2019 was 2.49%.

Information in respect of the carrying value and interest arising on lease liabilities, as derived from our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, is set out below:

**As of and for the year**
**ended December 31, 2019**
**Total cash outflow for leases** **(£ in millions)**
Payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities ......................................... 6.8
Payments for the Interest portion of lease liabilities ............................................ 1.1
**Lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet**
Current ................................................................................................................. 7.5

One to two years .................................................................................................. 7.3
Two to five years ................................................................................................. 17.7
More than five years ............................................................................................ 17.5

The lease liability recognized on adoption of IFRS 16 was £45.6 million. Operating lease commitments under IAS
17 disclosed at December 31, 2018 were £30.4 million, which approximates to £26.6 million when discounted at
the incremental borrowing rate disclosed above. The difference arises due to the different recognition criteria of
IFRS 16 such as treatment of extension options and the inclusion of liabilities for onerous leases, previously
recorded within provisions.

Right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid
or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2018. Onerous
lease contracts required an adjustment to the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

- any initial direct costs; and

- restoration costs.

Information in respect of the carrying value of right of use assets, as derived from our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, is set out below:

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, EBITDA, segment assets and segment liabilities for the year ended and as
at December 31, 2019 all increased compared to their comparative value as accounted under IAS 17 as at
December 31, 2019. Information in respect of depreciation, EBITDA and segment liabilities, as derived from our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, is set out below:

**Finance** **Increase in** **Increase in**

**Depreciation** **EBITDA** **Costs** **assets** **liabilities**

**Total ........................................................** **(7.3)** **7.9** **(1.1)** **38.9** **(41.9)**

As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 0.1
pence per share compared to its comparative value as accounted under IAS 17 as at December 31, 2019.

**_Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions_**

We consummated the following acquisitions and dispositions:

2020

- On July 3, 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire OMNOVA. The
Acquisition closed on April 1, 2020.

2018

Perstorp Oxo Belgium AB) for a cash consideration of £66.1 million. Speciality Additives was bought
to enhance our existing coatings customer base.

**_Organizational Restructuring of Business Segments_**

Prior to January 1, 2019, we operated under the two regional business segments below:

- _Europe and North America (“ENA”): For the year ended December 31, 2018, ENA had revenue of_
£1,228.4 million and operating profit of £91.8 million, with EBITDA of £135.8 million and Underlying
operating profit of £111.2 million.

- _Asia and Rest of the World (“ARW”): For the year ended December 31, 2018, ARW had revenue of_
£390.5 million and operating profit of £54.9 million, with EBITDA of £59.7 million and Underlying
operating profit of £45.7 million.

Following a review in 2018, we decided to implement a new organizational group structure starting from January
1, 2019, to reflect the increasingly global nature of our operations. The new structure enables us to better serve

113


-----

our customers, provide a global product offering, drive operational efficiencies and leverage our product portfolio
globally. The structure, which will accommodate OMNOVA going forward, combines sales, marketing, research
and production into dedicated global business teams, while retaining strong regional focus. Under our new
structure, the three global operating segments are:

- _Performance Elastomers: This segment focuses on the healthcare and protection, paper, carpet,_
compounds and foam sectors through our NBR and SBR latex products. For the year ended December
31, 2019, Performance Elastomers had revenue of £623.7 million and volumes of 849.1 kilotonnes,
representing, respectively, 42.7% of our revenue and 57.9% of total volumes of products sold, for this
period, with EBITDA of £96.3 million and Underlying operating profit of £71.5 million.

- _Functional Solutions: This segment focuses on coatings, textiles, construction, oil field and adhesives_
sectors through Synthomer’s acrylic and vinylic based dispersion products. For the year ended December
31, 2019, Functional Solutions had revenue of £612.8 million and volumes of 487.4 kilotonnes,
representing respectively 42.0% of our revenue and 33.3% of total volumes of products sold, for this
period, with EBITDA of £69.9 million and Underlying operating profit of £52.3 million.

- _Industrial Specialities: This segment focuses on the construction, automotive, catalyst and polymer_
manufacturing sectors through Synthomer’s non-water-based polymer applications. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Industrial Specialities had revenue of £222.6 million (excluding inter-segmental
revenue) and volumes of 129.2 kilotonnes, representing respectively 15.3% of our revenue and 8.8% of
total volumes of products sold, for this period, with EBITDA of £24.8 million and Underlying operating
profit of £16.0 million.

For further information on the operating segments presented under the new organizational structure for the year
ended December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum, see note 38 of the notes to the audited consolidated
financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum and note 5 of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Comparisons
of financial results for the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 have been presented in this Offering
Memorandum based on the prior segmental basis while comparisons of financial results for the financial years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 have been presented based on the new organization structure described above.

Following the Acquisition, we have reassessed how the business would be managed going forward. Our Acrylates
business, which was previously managed and reported within the Industrial Specialities segment, was identified
as a separate segment. A new management structure has been implemented, and as of March 31, 2020,
management information for Acrylates has been reported separately to our executive committee. Therefore, the
comparisons of financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 have been presented in this
Offering Memorandum based on the updated organizational structure as of January 1, 2020.

A segmental analysis of IFRS, Underlying performance and Special Items is shown below for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2019, as derived from our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the
years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019:

**_Impact of COVID-19 on our business_**

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, our financial results were not significantly impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, although our Functional Solutions operating segment experienced declines in EBITDA and
Revenue, in part due to weaker Asian demand in March, as a result of COVID-19. In many of the jurisdictions in
which we operate, we are classified as an essential industry, which allowed us to continue to operate. We
experienced minor disruptions along our supply chains. We are currently unable to predict the medium- or longterm impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business and our industry. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to our Business and Industry—The outbreak of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have a negative_
_impact on our sales and operations.”_

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, changes
to the way we conduct our business. For example, following government guidelines in the jurisdictions in which
we operate, we have implemented measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as allowing our employees
to work from home, suspend domestic and international travel, promote social distancing and the use of personal
protective equipment and have enhanced our cleaning procedures at our manufacturing facilities. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and Industry—We may be subject to information technology systems_
_failures, network disruptions and breaches of cyber security. A cyber incident could occur and result in_
_information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Relating to our Business and Industry—Developments in the EU, market perceptions concerning any uncertainties_
_or instability with regard to the future of the U.K.’s relationships with the EU or the future of the euro and the_
_Eurozone could have adverse consequences for us.” We also continue to monitor all guidance by the relevant_
public agencies such as the World Health Organization, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in the United States, among others, to continue to apply best practices in an effort to contain the
spread of COVID-19 and keep our employees and clients safe.

The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted sales volumes across the Group due to weaker
end market demand, the closure of certain customers and disruptions in certain parts of our supply chain. While
Nitrile latex demand remained strong, sales into industrial markets, including the automotive, coatings, paper,
carpet and oil and gas sectors were impacted significantly by COVID-19 in all major geographies. Sales volumes
over the period declined by approximately 20% as compared to the corresponding period in 2019.

We have implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. For
example, we have decided to suspend our payment of our final dividend for the financial year 2019, while
members of our Board, executive committee and senior management have decided to freeze their pay at 2019
levels and delay any further review of salary increases until October 2020.

**KEY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS**

The following is a description of certain line items as discussed in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Synthomer”:_

**Revenue**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived revenue from our three global operating segments,
Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities. As of January 1, 2020, information for
our acrylate monomers business, which had previously formed part of our Industrial Specialities segment, has
been reported separately as Acrylates. In each global operating segments, we earn revenues from the sales of four
types of products: NBR, SBR, Dispersions and Specialities.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in a contract with a customer
when performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product
is transferred from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant asset in line with the international commercial terms
developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (“incoterms”) under which it is sold. The significant
majority of Synthomer’s products are sold under carriage paid to (“CPT”) and carriage and insurance paid
(“CIP”) incoterms. Under these terms, control of the product is transferred when the goods reach their destination.
At this point the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred and there is no unfulfilled obligation that
could affect the customer’s acceptance of the product.

**Cost of Sales**

Cost of sales includes raw materials and other fixed and variable production costs associated with producing the
products for sale. Fixed costs included in the cost of sales are the wages and salaries of plant workers, rent, repairs
and maintenance, while variable costs include the costs of raw materials, freight, utilities, packaging and
consumables.

**Gross Profit**

Gross profit is calculated as revenue less the cost of sales.

**Sales and Marketing Costs**

Sales and marketing costs primarily relate to costs incurred in respect of sales personnel, including wages and
salaries and travel expenses, in addition to marketing, advertising and subscriptions to associated trade bodies.

**Administrative Expenses**

Administrative expenses typically include indirect wages and salaries associated with our employees, as well as
indirect overheads. Indirect overheads would include such items as R&D expenses, insurance costs, legal and
professional fees and office supplies, marketing and promotional expenditure and costs associated with a listed
public company.

**EBITDA**

EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items (as described above
under “—Financial Statements Discussed”).

**Depreciation and amortization**

Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the production,
sales or distribution of products, as well as amortization of intangible assets.

116


-----

**Underlying Operating Profit**

Underlying operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before finance costs, taxation, and Special
Items.

**Finance Costs**

Finance Costs is calculated as interest payable on borrowings and overdrafts less interest receivable, the
amortization of set-up costs for facilities, plus interest charges payable on pension liabilities which are recognized
and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits and fair value of unhedged interest derivatives.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is
based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities
are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilized.

**Underlying Performance**

The IFRS profit measures show our performance as a whole and as such includes all sources of income and
expenses, including both irregular items and those that do not relate to our ongoing businesses. To provide
additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses, management uses “Underlying
performance” as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control and assess the performance of the
business. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items as described above
under “—Financial Statements Discussed.”

**RESULTS OF UNDERLYING OPERATIONS**

**Comparison of Underlying Financial Results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020**

_Underlying Revenue_

Revenue decreased by £36.7 million, or 9.8%, to £338.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from
£375.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to reductions in raw material prices as
lower oil prices and markets for raw materials lengthened. This decrease was partly offset by an increase in sales
volumes of 0.6%, as all segments apart from Functional Solutions saw stronger sales volumes in the quarter. On
a constant currency basis, revenue decreased by 9.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Revenues from Performance Elastomers decreased by £7.0 million, or 4.5%, to £149.7 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020, from £156.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to
the impact of lower raw material costs. Sales volumes were 3.5% higher as nitrile latex volume benefitted from
an additional 90 kilotonnes of new capacity added in the fourth quarter of 2018 and SBR market demand remained
relatively stable, with only modest reductions as compared to the comparative period in 2019.

Revenues from Functional Solutions decreased by £26.7 million, or 16.8%, to £132.4 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from £159.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to lower
raw material costs and a decrease in sales volumes of 5.2% as a result of weaker end markets and some impact
from weaker Asian demand due to COVID-19 in March 2020.

Revenues from Industrial Specialities decreased by £1.0 million, or 2.4%, to £41.4 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from £42.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to lower
raw material costs. This decrease was partly offset by stronger unit margins, which increased by 5.2% and
improved sales volumes.

Revenues from Acrylates decreased by £1.4 million, or 7.4%, to £17.4 million for the three months ended March
31, 2020, from £18.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to lower raw material
costs. This decrease was partly offset by higher volumes of external sales, which increased by 8.9%.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £2.0 million, or 4.6%, to £45.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from
£43.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to sales volumes and unit margins being
stronger than the comparative period. This increase was partly offset by a limited impact on sales volumes in
March 2020 due to the impact on supply chains in Asia and in selected segments, such as oil and gas and
automotive, as a consequence of COVID-19.

EBITDA in Performance Elastomers increased by £1.5 million, or 6.7%, to £23.9 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from £22.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to stronger
demand for Nitrile latex products benefitting from the additional capacity introduced in the fourth quarter of 2018.
SBR market conditions stabilized with volumes in line and unit margins ahead of prior year. The increase was
partly offset by margins being marginally lower for Nitrile latex relative to a strong comparative period in 2019.

118


-----

EBITDA in Functional Solutions increased by £2.6 million, or 14.8%, to £20.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, from £17.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to stronger unit
margins as a result of an improved mix and softer raw material markets. This increase was partly offset by sales
volumes being lower than the comparative period in 2019, due in part to weaker end markets in March 2020 as
the impact of COVID-19 affected supply chains in Asia.

EBITDA in Industrial Specialities increased by £0.2 million, or 3.4%, to £6.0 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, from £5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to stronger unit
margins as a result of an improved mix of product margins that were otherwise individually flat as compared to a
strong comparative period.

EBITDA in Acrylates decreased by £2.2 million, to a negative EBITDA of £1.1 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from £1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to lower unit
margins for external sales of acrylate monomers. This decrease was partly offset by an increase in external sales
volumes in 2020.

_Underlying Depreciation and Amortization_

Underlying depreciation & amortization increased by £0.5 million, or 4.1%, to £12.8 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from £12.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to
depreciation resulting from an investment in new capacity which, in 2019, came onstream in Functional Solutions
and Industrial Specialities. This increase was partly offset by a reduction in Performance Elastomers due to the
age of selected assets.

_Underlying Operating Profit_

Underlying operating profit increased by £1.5 million, or 4.9%, to £32.3 million for the three months ended March
31, 2020, from £30.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to stronger sales volumes
of Nitrile latex and higher margins across the majority of the businesses. This increase was partly offset by weaker
margins in Acrylates and a limited impact on sales volume in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19 in Functional
Solutions markets.

The table below outlines the Special Items for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 and
provides a reconciliation between IFRS operating profit and Underlying operating profit for the periods:

**For the three months ended**
**March 31,**
**2019** **2020**
**£ millions**
Underlying operating profit ......................................................................... 30.8 32.3
Special Items[(1)] ............................................................................................ (2.9) 3.9

Restructuring and site closure costs ......................................................... (0.5) —

**Operating profit—IFRS ............................................................................** **27.9** **36.2**

(1) For further discussion of Special Items, refer to “—Operating Profit—IFRS” below.

_Operating Profit—IFRS_

IFRS operating profit increased by £8.3 million, or 29.7%, to £36.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020, from £27.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Operating profit attributable to Special
Items increased by £6.8 million, to £3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from a loss of £2.9
million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

The amortization of acquired intangibles relate to acquired customer relationships. Amortization of acquired
intangibles decreased to £2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from £2.4 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2019 as a result of the final tranche of customer-related intangibles from the 2011
PolymerLatex acquisition reaching the end of their amortization period in the first quarter of 2019.

119


-----

Acquisition costs and related gains for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were related to the acquisition of
OMNOVA and comprise £2.7 million of costs, offset by a gain of £8.7 million on a foreign exchange derivative
entered into in July 2019 to hedge the Acquisition price.

Restructuring and site closure costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were related to the reorganization
of the Group into global business segments.

_Underlying Finance Costs_

Underlying finance costs decreased by £0.2 million, or 8.3%, to £2.2 million for the three months ended March
31, 2020, from £2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. This was primarily due to a £0.2 million
reduction in net interest expense on defined benefit obligation.

_Underlying Profit Before Tax_

As a result of the foregoing, Underlying profit before tax increased by £1.7 million, or 6.0%, to £30.1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, from £28.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

_Underlying Taxation_

Underlying taxation increased by £1.4 million, or 35.0%, to £5.4 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020, from £4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The effective tax rate on Underlying
performance increased to 17.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from 14.1% for the three months
ended March 31, 2019. The increase in the underlying tax rate was primarily due to the end of our pioneer status
tax treatment in Malaysia and a change in the geographic mix of profits for the three months ended March 31,
2020.

**Comparison of Underlying Financial Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019**

Our consolidated results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 prepared under
IFRS are reported in Synthomer Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Information for Synthomer”

(1) We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019, which has had an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income

statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the

modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. As a result, our results as of and for the years

120


-----

ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 may not be comparable with the information presented as of and for the year ended December 31,

2019.

_Underlying Revenue_

Revenue decreased by £159.8 million, or 9.9%, to £1,459.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
£1,618.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a slowdown in key European SBR
markets and lower raw material input costs. This decrease was partly offset by the growth of our non SBR
businesses and the resilience and diversity of our portfolio. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased by
9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Revenues from Performance Elastomers decreased by £80.8 million, or 11.5%, to £623.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from £704.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a
challenging year in SBR sales with volumes and margins lower due to the weaker European paper market. This
decrease was partly offset by record NBR latex sales volume growth underpinned by the 90 kilotonne capacity
expansion in our Pasir Gudang facility commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Revenues from Functional Solutions decreased by £67.3 million, or 9.9%, to £612.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £680.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a challenging
macro environment and lower raw material costs.

Revenues from Industrial Specialities decreased by £11.7 million, or 5.0%, to £222.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £234.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a challenging
macro environment and lower raw material costs.

_Underlying Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by £139.8 million, or 10.6%, to £1,185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
from £1,325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower raw material costs and lower
sales volumes.

_Underlying Gross Profit_

Gross profit decreased by £20.0 million, or 6.8%, to £273.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
£293.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the slowdown in our European SBR
business and the significant rise in depreciation attributable to the significant capacity expansion program from
2017 to 2019. This decrease was partly offset by the growth in our non SBR businesses and the resilience and
diversity of our portfolio.

_Underlying Sales & Marketing Costs_

Sales and marketing costs increased by £1.3 million, or 2.1%, to £43.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, from £42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our focus on growing our
proportion of higher margin differentiated products. This increase was partly offset by the cost reduction program
(“Mindset”), which commenced in 2019. Mindset is our non-manpower fixed cost reduction program covering
all areas of the business. Mindset launched in Europe in 2019 and will be rolled out further.

_Underlying Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by £17.3 million, or 24.6%, to £53.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, from £70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our focus on cost reduction via
the initial phase of our Mindset cost reduction program.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA decreased by £3.1 million, or 1.7%, to £177.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
£181.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of weaker market conditions
in the European paper market, which in turn affected the SBR segment within Performance Elastomers. This

121


-----

decrease was partly offset by the introduction of IFRS 16 and by the resilient performance of all the other
businesses, which saw EBITDA increase in all businesses apart from SBR.

EBITDA in Performance Elastomers decreased by £11.6 million, or 10.8%, to £96.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £107.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the impact of
an SBR slowdown in Europe and the 2018 closure of our Malaysian natural rubber and polyester resins business.
This was partly offset by growth in our NBR business.

EBITDA in Functional Solutions increased by £5.8 million, or 9.0%, to £69.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a resilient
performance in challenging market conditions with stronger unit margins offsetting lower volumes.

EBITDA in Industrial Specialities increased by £1.3 million, or 5.5%, to £24.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a resilient
performance in challenging market conditions with stronger unit margins offsetting lower volumes.

_Underlying Depreciation & Amortization_

Underlying depreciation & amortization increased by £13.2 million, or 33.9%, to £52.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to significant rise
in depreciation attributable to the significant capacity expansion program from 2017 to 2019 and the accounting
changes relating to the adoption of IFRS 16.

_Underlying Operating Profit_

Underlying operating profit decreased by £16.3 million, or 11.5%, to £125.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from £142.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The table below outlines the Special Items for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31,
2019 and provides a reconciliation between IFRS operating profit and Underlying operating profit for the periods:

**For the year ended**
**December 31,**
**2018** **2019[(1)]**

statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the

modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. As a result, our results as of and for the years

ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 may not be comparable with the information presented as of and for the year ended December 31,

2019.

(2) For further discussion of Special Items, refer to “—Operating Profit—IFRS” below.

_Operating Profit—IFRS_

IFRS operating profit decreased by £18.1 million, or 14.1%, to £110.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, from £128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating loss attributable to Special Items

122


-----

increased by £1.8 million, to £15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from £13.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

The restructuring and site closure costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were related to our reorganization
into global business segments. The restructuring and site closure costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were
related to the closure of natural rubber and polyester resins production lines in Kluang (Malaysia) in the fourth
quarter of 2018, as well as an increase in onerous lease and related provisions for our Ossett site due to a change
in circumstance relating to the subletting of the site.

Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, were due to our proposed acquisition of OMNOVA and
include a £4.0 million gain on a foreign exchange derivative in relation to the Acquisition price. Acquisition costs
for the year ended December 31, 2018 were related to costs associated with the BASF Pischelsdorf acquisition as
well as other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred as of December 31, 2018.

The amortization of acquired intangibles relates to acquired customer relationships. Amortization of acquired
intangibles decreased from £16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to £8.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as a result of customer-related intangibles from the 2011 PolymerLatex acquisition reaching
the end of their amortization period in the first half of 2018.

The gain on foreign exchange contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our Rights Issue and
represented a gain made in respect of a forward contract which was entered into to swap the proceeds of the
Sterling Rights Issue into euro in order to pay down part of our euro revolving credit facility.

The profit on sale of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the disposal of the Leuna site in
Germany and the disposal of 51% of our sales entities in Dubai.

The profit on sale of land for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the disposal of the final tranche of
Malaysian land in Kluang.

Aborted bond costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent costs related to a process that was undertaken
in 2018 to issue fixed rate unsecured senior notes. Despite a strong response from investors, we decided not to
complete the transaction due to unfavorable market conditions.

The U.K. Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalization for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent a £2.8
million actuarial adjustment booked in the second half of 2018, following the U.K. High Court’s ruling on
equalization of male and female guaranteed minimum pensions. This was treated as a pension plan amendment,
unrelated to our Underlying performance.

_Underlying Finance Costs_

Underlying finance costs increased by £2.6 million, or 37.1%, to £9.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019, from £7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to the adoption of IFRS
16 and the full year impact of the euro interest rate fix transacted in July 2018. The increase in underlying financial
costs was partly offset by lower net interest as the 2018 Revolving Facility amounts drawn have been reduced
with the Rights Issue, and a reduction in net interest expense on defined benefit obligations as a result of a higher
return on assets in the year.

_Underlying Profit Before Tax_

As a result of the foregoing, Underlying profit before tax decreased by £18.9 million, or 14.0%, to £116.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, from £135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Underlying Taxation_

Underlying taxation decreased by £6.7 million, or 29.1%, to £16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
from £23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effective tax rate on Underlying performance
decreased to 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(1) Underlying performance means the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special Items. See

“Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures For Synthomer.”

(2) We have applied IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in our

consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited comparative period as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited financial information as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2018. We have applied IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on our

amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited

comparative period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited

financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Underlying Revenue_

Revenue increased by £138.7 million, or 9.4%, to £1,618.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from
£1,480.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to significant improvements in Underlying
performance. ARW delivered strong growth, especially in Nitrile latex, with improving volumes and unit margins
helping to offset the impact of currency and raw material volatility in ENA. On a constant currency basis, revenue
increased by 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Revenues from ENA increased by £93.5 million, or 8.2%, to £1,228.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £1,134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to incremental volumes
associated with the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf in January 2018 and the acquisition of Speciality Additives
in March 2017, the positive impact of weaker pound sterling exchange rate and the lower average raw material
prices year on year. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by 7.1% for the year ended December 31,
2018.

124


-----

Revenues from ARW increased by £45.2 million, or 13.1%, to £390.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £345.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by continued strong growth
in Nitrile latex demand and the a weaker pound sterling exchange rate. On a constant currency basis, revenue
increased by 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Underlying Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £129.7 million, or 10.8%, to £1,325.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
from £1,195.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material
costs and the growth of the Group following the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf in January 2018 and the
acquisition of Speciality Additives in March 2017.

_Underlying Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by £9.0 million, or 3.2%, to £293.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from
£284.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the growth of the ARW business notably
Nitrile where volumes and margins were stronger in a market that reported strong growth.

_Underlying Sales & Marketing Costs_

Sales and marketing costs increased by £3.8 million, or 9.7%, to £42.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the bolt on acquisition of BASF
Pichelsdorf and the increased focus on more differentiated products where higher levels of technical service is a
key feature of the product offering.

_Underlying Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by £0.2 million, or 0.3%, to £70.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £70.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a strong focus on cost
management.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £4.8 million, or 2.7%, to £181.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from
£176.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the strength of our ARW segment, which
benefitted from Nitrile latex growth and improved plant utilization. This increase was partly offset by the impact
of currency and raw material volatility in the ENA segment

_Underlying Depreciation & Amortization_

Underlying depreciation & amortization increased by £1.7 million, or 4.6%, to £38.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, from £37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the investment
in growth capex which commenced in 2017.

_Underlying Operating Profit_

Underlying operating profit increased by £3.1 million, or 2.2%, to £142.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an
increase in Underlying operating profits in ARW, which increased by 30.2% for the year ended December 31,
2018. Underlying operating profits in ENA decreased by 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. On a
constant currency basis, Underlying operating profits increased by 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase in Underlying operating profit in ARW was primarily due to record Nitrile latex volumes, partly
reflecting the benefit from the newly commissioned Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) manufacturing site increasing our
production capacity in the fourth quarter of 2018 and partly reflecting the weaker first half of 2017 comparative,
which was adversely impacted by raw material price volatility. On a constant currency basis, operating profit in
ARW increased by 25.6%.

125


-----

The decrease in Underlying operating profit in ENA was primarily due to the marked reduction in petrochemical
raw material prices in the final quarter of 2018 which exacerbated normal year-end customer de-stocking activities
resulting in a fall in volumes. On a constant currency basis, operating profit in ENA decreased by 5.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

The table below outlines the Special Items for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 and provides a
reconciliation between IFRS operating profit and Underlying operating profit for the periods:

**For the year ended**
**December 31,**

**Operating profit—IFRS .............................................................................** **95.4** **128.7**

(1) For further discussion of Special Items, refer to “—Operating Profit—IFRS” below.

_Operating Profit—IFRS_

IFRS operating profit increased by £33.3 million, or 34.9%, to £128.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Special Items decreased by £30.2 million, or
69.3%, from a loss of £43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of £13.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

The restructuring and site closure costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the closure of
natural rubber and polyester resins production lines in Kluang, Malaysia in the fourth quarter of 2018, and an
increase in the onerous lease and related provisions for the Ossett site due to a change in circumstance relating to
the subletting of the site.

The profit on sale of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the disposal of the Leuna site in
Germany and the disposal of 51% of our sales entities in Dubai.

The profit on sale of land for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the disposal of the final tranche of
Malaysian land in Kluang. The profit on sale of land for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to a disposal
of land in Hapton, U.K.

Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the purchase of BASF Pischelsdorf
and for other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred before December 31, 2018, while
acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to the acquisition of Speciality Additives
as well as other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred as of December 31, 2017.

The amortization of acquired intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to a full year of
amortization for intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of PolymerLates in 2011 and PAC
in 2016, the part year of amortization for intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Speciality
Additives in 2017 and due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. The decrease in the amortization of
intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to the full amortization during the year of the
PolymerLatex customer relationships acquired during 2011.

126


-----

Aborted bond costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent costs related to a process that was undertaken
in 2018 to issue fixed rate unsecured senior notes. Despite a strong response from investors, we decided not to
complete the transaction due to unfavorable market conditions.

The U.K. Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalization for the year ended December 31, 2018 represents a £2.8
million actuarial adjustment booked in the second half of 2018, following the U.K. High Court’s ruling on
equalization of male and female Guaranteed Minimum Pensions. This was treated as a pension plan amendment,
unrelated to our Underlying performance.

_Underlying Finance Costs_

Underlying finance costs decreased by £2.0 million, or 22.2%, to £7.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, from £9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to our borrowing predominantly in
euro in the year compared with multiple currencies in 2017, lower variable euro interest rates in the first half of
the year and a lower pensions interest charge as a result of the reduced discount rate in relation to the U.K. and
overseas defined benefit pension schemes. This was partly offset by a higher cost fixed euro interest rate swap in
the second half of the year.

_Underlying Profit Before Tax_

As a result of the foregoing, Underlying profit before tax increased by £5.1 million, or 3.9%, to £135.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, from £130.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As well as
taking into account the improvement in Underlying performance, the increase in IFRS profits is mainly the result
of the gains on disposal of land in Malaysia which sold for £16.4 million and a reduction in amortization of
intangible assets in the amount of £14.6 million.

_Underlying Taxation_

Underlying taxation decreased by £1.7 million, or 6.9%, to £23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
from £24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate on Underlying performance
remained relatively stable decreasing from 19% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 17% for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The reduction is primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of profits, prior year items
and decreases in tax rates in certain jurisdictions.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated
from operations and any borrowings under our financing arrangements. Our liquidity needs consist primarily of
funding operating expenses, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, debt service requirements and other
liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time.

We regularly review performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet
our contractual obligations and liquidity requirements. We believe that following the Offering, our operating cash
flows, borrowing capacity under our financing arrangements and the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby will be
sufficient to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements and commitments. Our actual financing
requirements will depend on a number of factors, however, some of which may be beyond our control. See “Risk
_Factors” and “Description of Other Debt.”_

(1) We have applied IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognized in our

consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited comparative period as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited financial information as of and

for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2018. We have applied IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on our

amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including the unaudited

comparative period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017). Accordingly there were no restatements applied to the unaudited

financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented in the consolidated financial statements of Synthomer

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(2) We adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019, which has had an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income

statement and cash flow statement. In implementing IFRS 16, our consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the

modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. As a result, our results as of and for the years

ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 may not be comparable with the information presented as of and for the year ended December 31,

2019.

(3) We define net borrowings as total current borrowings (including bank overdrafts) and non-current borrowings, less cash and cash

equivalents.

**_Operating activities_**

Net cash outflow from operating activities increased by £2.7 million, or 12.5%, to £24.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020, from £21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to
a £2.0 million increase in overseas corporate tax paid.

128


-----

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £54.5 million, or 56.0%, to £151.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from £97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a working
capital outflow in 2018 and an inflow in 2019 largely following the trend in raw material prices and tight working
capital management.

Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £34.3 million, or 26.0%, to £97.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, from £131.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an
investment in working capital as raw material prices increased.

**_Investing activities_**

Net cash outflow from investing activities decreased by £0.2 million, or 1.4%, to £13.7 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020, from £13.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to
a reduction in capital expenditure.

Net cash outflow from investing activities decreased by £12.0 million, or 15.2%, to £67.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, from £79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a net £22.1
million of acquisition costs in the prior year, partly offset by a £10.6 million increase in capital expenditure.

Net cash outflow from investing activities decreased by £33.4 million, or 29.7%, to £79.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, from £112.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to lower
cash outflow for the purchase of businesses.

**_Financing activities_**

Net cash inflow from financing activities increased to £389.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
from a net cash outflow of £1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, due to a £391.6 million
drawdown on borrowings on March 31, 2020 in preparation for the completion of the acquisition of OMNOVA.

Net cash outflow from financing activities increased to £60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from
£9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a larger repayment of borrowings in the year
ended December 31, 2019.

Net cash outflow from financing activities increased to £9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from
£8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a larger dividend payment, partly offset by
higher net proceeds from borrowings.

**Capital expenditure**

Capital expenditure, (which represents purchase of property, plant and equipment as recorded in our consolidated
cash flow statement), decreased by £0.5 million, or 3.5%, to £13.9 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020 from £14.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to planned
reductions in capital expenditure, as growth capital expenditure projects conducted over the previous three years
were completed, and partly as a result of measures taken to reduce capital expenditure as a prudent measure in
advance of any impact of COVID-19 on liquidity.

Capital expenditure decreased by £6.6 million, or 8.7%, to £69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
from £75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decreased was primarily due to the substantial
completion of our major capacity expansion projects in Pasir Gudang (Malaysia), Worms (Germany) and Roebuck
(USA) in 2018 and 2019. We commenced investment in a new Innovation Centre and a new 60 kilotonne NBR
capacity expansion in Malaysia and began a three year business transformation program. Recurring expenditure
on SHE and sustenance was approximately £26 million in 2019, a decrease from approximately £29 million in
2018.

Capital expenditure increased by £15.4 million, or 25.5%, to £75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018
from £60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the Pasir Gudang
capacity expansion program in Malaysia, which increased our capacity for production of NBR products and
debottlenecking at our manufacturing facility in Worms (Germany).

129


-----

We divide our capital expenditures into two categories: maintenance and growth. We classify maintenance capital
expenditure as capital expenditure needed to support current operations and capital expenditures related to safety,
health and environment-related updates. We classify growth capital expenditure as discretionary capital
expenditure used to fund expansion, debottlenecking and other similar investments to facilitate the growth of our
revenues or improvement of our margins. We have historically had relatively low maintenance capital expenditure
requirements of approximately £20 million to £25 million, which has given us the flexibility to invest in growth
capital expenditure to enhance our operations.

The table below sets out our maintenance and growth capital expenditure for the periods indicated.

**Year ended December 31,**
**2017** **2018** **2019**
**£ millions**
Maintenance capital expenditure ................ 19.5 24.3 21.4
Growth capital expenditure ....................... 40.8 51.4 47.7

**Capital expenditure ..................................** 60.3 75.7 69.1

**Working capital**

We define working capital as inventories plus trade and other receivables less trade and other payables. Our
working capital requirements are affected by seasonality which affects our sales volumes and movements in the
prices of raw materials. Working capital levels typically develop in line with raw material prices, although timing
factors can affect flows of capital and working capital represents approximately 10% of total sales.

**Contractual obligations**

We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

The following table details our contractual obligations for financial liabilities, including our main contractual
obligations after giving effect to the Transactions, but excluding interest payments. The contractual maturity is
based on the earliest date on which we may be required to repay amounts outstanding.

(2) On July 3, 2019, the Issuer, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, which

provides for the 2019 Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility permits borrowings from time to time of up to $260 million, maturing

on July 3, 2024. The 2019 Term Loan Facility was drawn in full on the Completion Date in an aggregate principal amount of £209.3

million in connection with the Acquisition.

(3) On July 3, 2019, the Issuer, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, which

provides for the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility permits borrowings from time to time of up to €460

million, maturing on July 3, 2024. We drew down £130.6 million under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility on the Completion Date in

connection with the Acquisition and to fund our working capital requirements.

(4) Represents bank overdrafts as of March 31, 2020.

130


-----

**_Pension liabilities_**

We have funding requirements relating to defined benefit pension scheme obligations, the value of which are
dependent on fluctuating financial markets. As of December 31, 2019, our net pensions deficit totaled
£140.0 million, of which 39.8%, or £55.7 million, related to pensions in the U.K., and 60.2%, or £84.3 million,
related to pensions in other countries, of which £76.2 million relates to pension liabilities in Germany. The liability
recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Our U.K. defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the Group in separate
trustee-administered funds. We also operate a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany, which are closed
to new members. In line with common practice, our German schemes are unfunded, with liabilities settled on a
cash basis by the respective companies as they fall due. The assets of our other overseas schemes are held
separately from those of the Group.

In 2009, the U.K. scheme was closed to new participants and also to future accrual for existing participants. We
are committed to reducing pension benefit liabilities through our pension deficit recovery plan, which we entered
in 2015, with planned annual payments aimed at eliminating the U.K. pension shortfall by 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, U.K. pension costs included an irregular cost (included in Special Items)
for the equalization to guaranteed minimum pension (“GMP”) of £2.8 million.

The reduction in U.K. defined benefit pension liabilities of £25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
compared to the comparative period in 2017, primarily related to an increase in the discount rate from 2.5% to
2.8% of £16.9 million combined with a reduction of membership data in the amount of £11.1 million, and offset
by the GMP equalization increase of £2.8 million.

Our pension contributions and liabilities are subject to changes in the discount rates and mortality actuarial
assumptions applied, movements in the financial markets, including inflation, as well as movements in exchange
rates. For example, our post-retirement benefit obligations in the U.K. decreased by £25.1 million as of
December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due an improvement in mortality actuarial
assumptions together with a pension scheme deficit recovery payment, partly offset by an increase in the discount
rate from 2.5% to 2.8%.

**OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. In addition, we had contracted capital expenditure
commitments of £11.6 million as of March 31, 2020.

As of March 31, 2020, we did not currently hold any off-balance sheet financial derivatives or have any leases
recorded as finance leases. As mentioned below under “—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on Market
_Risk—Foreign Currency Risk”, we have a policy of hedging all significant foreign exchange transactional_
exposure at operating company level. We borrow a proportion of our funding in overseas currencies to hedge the
net assets held in those currencies.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ON MARKET RISK**

We are, in the normal course of business, exposed to a variety of financial risks, including market risks and interest
rate risks.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

A significant proportion of our revenue and assets are in currencies other than pound sterling and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates may significantly impact our results. We have a policy of hedging all significant foreign
exchange transactional exposure at operating company level. We borrow a proportion of our funding in overseas
currencies to hedge the net assets held in those currencies.

131


-----

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Our balance sheet and cash flow position, and also credit market conditions and credit ratings, may restrict our
ability of to obtain credit facilities or to refinance our existing debt facilities in the longer term. We closely monitor
our operating cash flow and capital expenditure on a monthly basis and regularly reviews covenant compliance.

**_Pension Funding Risk_**

We have funding risks relating to defined benefit pension scheme obligations, the value of which are dependent
on volatile financial markets. The U.K. scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009 and additional contributions
and careful asset management should reduce the deficit over the longer term. Pension deficits are expected to
reduce over the longer term as we pay the additional contributions agreed with the Trustees in 2019. The timescale
will be affected by movements in the financial markets and the discount rate.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We finance our operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. We monitor interest rate
trends regularly, through discussion with our banks, and fix interest rates when it is prudent to do so. The following
table illustrates the effect on the consolidated income statement and items that are recognized directly in equity
for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 that would result from reasonably possible movements
in U.K. and U.S. interest rates:

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS FOR OMNOVA**

financial year ended November 30, 2019, 6% for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and 7%
for the financial year ended November 30, 2017.

OMNOVA was incorporated in Ohio, United States. OMNOVA became an independently, publicly-traded
company on October 1, 1999, when it was spun off by GenCorp Inc., its former parent company. OMNOVA
Shares are listed on the NYSE under the trading name “OMN.” As at November 30, 2019, OMNOVA employed
approximately 1,850 employees globally. On April 1, 2020, in connection with the Acquisition, OMNOVA was
delisted from the NYSE.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

The OMNOVA Board believes that the following factors have had, and may continue to have, a material effect
on OMNOVA’s results of operations.

**_Raw Material Pricing and Availability_**

A majority of OMNOVA’s raw materials are derived from petrochemicals and chemical feedstocks, where prices
can be cyclical and volatile. Styrene, a key raw material for OMNOVA, is generally available worldwide, and
OMNOVA has supply contracts with several producers. OMNOVA’s styrene purchases for the financial years
ended November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the range of market prices were as follows:

**Pounds**
**purchased** **Market price**

Financial year ended November 30, **(in millions)** **range per pound**

2019 ....................................................................................................... 91 $0.41–$0.55
2018 ....................................................................................................... 102 $0.53–$0.73
2017 ....................................................................................................... 129 $0.48–$0.72

Butadiene, a key raw material for OMNOVA, is generally available worldwide, but its price is volatile. OMNOVA
has supply contracts with several producers. At times, when the demand for butadiene exceeds supply, it is sold
on an allocated basis. OMNOVA’s butadiene purchases for the financial years ended November 30, 2017, 2018
and 2019 and the range of market prices were as follows:


**Pounds**
**purchased** **Market price**

**Financial year ended November 30,** **(in millions)** **range per pound**

2019 ......................................................................................................... 67 $0.37–$0.58
2018 ......................................................................................................... 77 $0.36–$0.79
2017 ......................................................................................................... 103 $0.39–$1.42

Other key raw materials used by OMNOVA include acrylates, PVC resins, textiles, and plasticizers. These raw
materials are generally available worldwide from several suppliers.

OMNOVA negotiates pricing with a majority of customers considering the value-added performance attributes
of those products and the cost of the raw materials. OMNOVA’s pricing objective, which may or may not be met,
is to recover raw material price increases for non-indexed contracts within three months.

OMNOVA had indexed sales price contracts covering approximately 25% of its sales in 2019. These contract
indexes are generally comprised of several components: a negotiated fixed amount per pound and the market
price of key raw materials (i.e., styrene and butadiene). The indexed contracts provide that OMNOVA will pass
through the increases or decreases of key raw materials.

135

**_Seasonal Factors_**

OMNOVA historically experience stronger sales and income in its second, third, and fourth quarters, comprised
of the three-month periods ending May 31, August 31, and November 30: OMNOVA’s performance in the first
quarter has historically been affected by generally lower levels of customer manufacturing, construction, and
refurbishment activities during the holidays and cold weather months.

**_Restructurings_**

OMNOVA carried out several key initiatives during 2019 and maintained the following restructuring plans:

**_2018 Restructuring Plan_**

During the third quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2018, OMNOVA announced its plan to close
its styrene butadiene manufacturing facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin, moving production to OMNOVA’s
Mogadore, Ohio facility. OMNOVA incurred $4.3 million of restructuring and severance expenses in financial
year 2019 related to this plan. Total expense incurred for this plan was $6.1 million, all of which has been paid as
of November 30, 2019. As of November 30, 2019, the plan was considered complete. On March 27, 2019,
OMNOVA announced expected cost savings of $7 to $8 million. On July 3, 2019, OMNOVA reaffirmed its
expected cost savings of $7 to $8 million, and that it expects to realize approximately half of the savings during
the second half of financial year 2019, with the full cost savings realized during the year ending November 30,
2020.

**_2017 Restructuring Plan_**

In the first quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2017, OMNOVA announced the launch of its One
OMNOVA initiative. The One OMNOVA initiative was focused on improving functional excellence in
marketing, sales, operations, supply chain and technology, as well as various corporate functions. The plan was
designed to reduce complexity and drive consistency across the global enterprise through a standardized,
integrated business system. OMNOVA incurred $1.0 million of restructuring and severance expense in financial
year 2019 related to this plan. Total expense incurred for this plan was $6.2 million, all of which has been paid as
of November 30, 2019. As of November 30, 2019, the plan was considered complete.

**Acquisitions and Disposals**

**_Resiquímica_**

In September 2018, OMNOVA acquired Resiquímica for consideration of €21.8 million ($25.8 million), net of
acquired cash plus debt assumed of $9.8 million. Resiquímica accounted for $10.7 million of sales for the financial
year ended November 30, 2018. Following completion of the acquisition, Resiquímica now operates as
OMNOVA Solutions Portugal, S.A. (“OMNOVA Portugal”).

**_Green Bay Facility_**

The OMNOVA Group completed the sale of its Green Bay, Wisconsin styrene butadiene facility on May 20,
2019. The closure of Green Bay is expected to deliver pre-tax cost savings and on July 3, 2019, OMNOVA
reaffirmed its expected cost savings of $7 to $8 million.

**_CCF_**

In July 2017, OMNOVA disposed of its China-based coated fabric manufacturing operation, China Coated Fabrics
(“CCF”). CCF accounted for $10.4 million in sales for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. Additionally,
during the second quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2017, in connection with the pending sale of
the CCF operations, OMNOVA recognized an impairment charge of $12.8 million to write down the asset group
to the contract sale price which approximated fair value.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Key economic measures relevant to OMNOVA include global economic growth rates, discretionary spending for
durable goods, oil and gas consumption and drilling levels, U.S. commercial real estate occupancy rates, U.S.
office furniture sales, manufactured housing shipments, housing starts and sales of existing homes, and forecasts
of raw material pricing for certain petrochemical feed stocks. Key original equipment manufacturer industries,
which provide a general indication of demand drivers to OMNOVA, include commercial and residential
construction and refurbishment, automotive and tire production, furniture, flooring, and ABS manufacturing.
These measures provide general information on trends relevant to the demand for OMNOVA’s products, but the
trend information does not necessarily directly correlate with demand levels in the markets which ultimately use
OMNOVA’s products in part because OMNOVA’s market share is relatively small in a number of specialty
markets.

Key operating measures utilized by the business segments include: orders; sales and pricing; inventory;
productivity; plant utilization; new product vitality; cost of quality; order fill-rates, which provide key indicators
of business trends; and safety and other internal metrics. These measures are reported on various cycles including
daily, weekly and monthly, depending on the needs established by operating management.

Key financial measures utilized by OMNOVA’s management to evaluate the results of its businesses and to
understand the key variables impacting the current and future results of OMNOVA include sales and pricing;
gross profit; selling, general, and administrative expenses; adjusted operating profit; adjusted net income;
EBITDA as set forth in the net leverage ratio in OMNOVA’s $350,000,000 Term Loan Credit Agreement;
adjusted EBITDA, working capital; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; cash interest expense; adjusted
earnings per share; return on invested capital; and applicable ratios, such as inventory turnover; working capital
turnover; return on sales and assets; and leverage ratios. These measures, as well as objectives established by
OMNOVA’s board of directors, are reviewed at monthly, quarterly, and annual intervals and compared with
historical periods.

**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**_Overview_**

The following table sets out OMNOVA’s consolidated results of operations for the financial years ended
November 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2020:

(2) OMNOVA adopted ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of financial year 2019. OMNOVA elected to use the practical expedient to use

amounts disclosed in the 2018 consolidated financial statements as an estimate for applying the retrospective presentation requirements.

As a result, selling, general, and administrative expense increased with an offsetting increase to other (income) expense, net of $2.0

million and $1.5 million for the financial years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively.

**_Comparison of the three months ended February 28, 2019 and February 29, 2020_**

_Net sales_

OMNOVA’s net sales for the three months ended February 29, 2020 were $155.6 million, a decrease of $13.3
million, or 7.9%, compared to $168.9 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The Specialty
Solutions business segment revenue in remained stable and the Performance Materials business revenue decreased
by $13.4 million, or 23.8%. The overall decrease was due to lower volume, primarily in paper and carpet, and the
negative impact of foreign currency, partly offset by favorable pricing and mix.

_Gross profit_

OMNOVA’s gross profit for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was $35.2 million, a decrease of $1.7
million, or 4.6%, compared to $36.9 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. Gross profit margin
increased to 22.6% for the three months ended February 29, 2020, from 21.8% for the three months ended
February 28, 2019. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to improved product mix and lower raw
material costs.

_Selling, general and administrative expenses_

OMNOVA’s selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was
$26.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 6.6%, compared to $28.7 million for the three months ended February
28, 2019. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee
incentive compensation costs and an overall focus on controlling selling, general and administrative expense.

_Interest expense_

OMNOVA’s interest expense for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was $4.6 million, a decrease of $0.4
million, or 8.0%, compared to $5.0 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The decrease in interest
expense was primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding debt.

_Tax_

OMNOVA’s income tax benefit for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was $0.9 million, an increase of
$0.1 million compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. OMNOVA’s effective tax
rate for the three months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 were different than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate primarily due to losses in jurisdictions in which no tax benefit was recognized.

Specialty Solutions

Specialty Solutions’ net sales remained relatively stable at $112.8 million for the three months ended February
29, 2020, compared to $112.7 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. Higher volumes in oil and
gas, decorative laminates, and performance films and favorable mix in decorative laminates and performance
films were partly offset by lower volumes in coatings, home and personal care, and nonwovens.

Specialty Solutions’ operating profit increased by $2.1 million, or 22.6%, to $11.4 million for the three months
ended February 29, 2020, compared to $9.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The increase
in segment operating profit was primarily due to favorable mix, primarily in decorative laminates, and favorable
raw material costs, primarily in nonwovens, coatings, and oil and gas. Segment operating profit includes items
that OMNOVA’s management excludes when evaluating the results of OMNOVA’s segments. Those items for
the three months ended February 29, 2020 included $0.3 million for acquisition and integration expenses and $0.2
million for a customs duty penalty. Those items for the three months ended February 28, 2019 were $0.1 million
of acquisition and integration related expenses

Performance Materials

Performance Materials net sales decreased $13.4 million, or 23.8%, to $42.8 million for the three months ended
February 29, 2020, compared to $56.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The decrease in net
sales was primarily due to unfavorable volume of $12.4 million, unfavorable price/mix of $0.6 million, and
unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $0.2 million compared to the three months ended February 28, 2019.
Volumes of carpet, paper, antioxidants and tire cord decreased, which was partly offset by increases in coated
fabrics and reinforcing, when compared to the three months ended February 28, 2019.

Performance Materials’ operating loss was $4.7 million for the three months ended February 29, 2020 compared
to an operating loss of $2.8 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. Segment operating loss includes
items that OMNOVA’s management excludes when evaluating the results of OMNOVA’s segments. Those items
for the first quarter of 2020 primarily consisted of $0.3 million of a customs duty penalty and $0.2 million of asset
impairment, facility and other closure costs. Those items for the three months ended February 28, 2019 included
$0.4 million of facility closure costs, $0.6 million of accelerated depreciation, and $0.7 million of restructuring
and severance costs.

_Corporate Expenses_

OMNOVA’s corporate expenses for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was $6.9 million, which is
unchanged from OMNOVA’s corporate expenses the three months ended February 28, 2019.

**_Comparison of the financial years ended November 30, 2018 and 2019_**

_Net sales_

OMNOVA’s net sales for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 were $736.2 million, a decrease of $33.6
million, or 4.4%, compared to $769.8 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. The Specialty
Solutions business segment revenue increased 5.2% and the Performance Materials business segment revenue
decreased by 20.9%. Contributing to the net sales decrease of $33.6 million for the financial year ended November
30, 2019 were lower volume of sales of $21.3 million, unfavorable foreign currency conversion rates of $11.2
million, and unfavorable price and mix of $1.1 million.

_Gross profit_

OMNOVA’s gross profit for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 was $176.2 million, a decrease of $14.5
million, or 7.6%, compared to $190.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. Gross profit margin
decreased to 23.9% for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, from 24.8% for the financial year ended
November 30, 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin resulted from lower volumes, primarily within
Performance Materials.

139


-----

The decrease in volume was primarily due to OMNOVA’s strategic transition away from the commodity paper
coatings market and volume reductions in the commodity carpet market, which were partly offset by improved
volume in the oil and gas, coatings and performance additives business lines.

_Selling, general and administrative expenses_

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $109.7 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2019, compared to $106.2 million for the financial year ended November 30,
2018. This increase was primarily due to increased use of outside services as a result of the Synthomer merger
transaction and the inclusion of full year expenses of OMNOVA Portugal, which was acquired in September 2018.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense was $20.0 million and $19.3 million for the financial years ended November 30, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. The slight increase was primarily due to a higher average debt balance resulting from drawings under
OMNOVA’s revolving credit arrangements.

_Foreign Currency Translation_

During the three months ended November 30, 2019, OMNOVA incurred $17.9 million of costs related to
initiatives to lower its cost structure. These initiatives involved, among other things, the liquidation of several
holding companies in Europe that resulted in the recognition of foreign currency translation losses.

_Tax_

Income tax expense decreased by $9.0 million to $3.4 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019,
compared to an income tax benefit of $6.2 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. The 2019
income tax expense was different than the statutory income tax rate of 21% primarily as a result of income in
foreign jurisdictions with a corresponding tax expense which was not offset by losses in the U.S. jurisdiction in
which no tax benefit was recognized. In addition, during financial year 2019, OMNOVA liquidated a Luxembourg
entity which resulted in a recapture gain of $9.8 million as net operating loss carryforwards were recaptured.

The 2018 income tax benefit was different than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to items related to the
Tax Act. In addition, OMNOVA recognized a $0.9 million income tax benefit related to the impact of a French
tax rate change on OMNOVA’s deferred tax liabilities. Based on French tax legislation enacted during the first
quarter of 2018, the French tax rate will be reduced to 25.0% beginning in 2022 and OMNOVA’s deferred tax
liabilities were reduced to appropriately reflect this legislation as a current period tax benefit in 2018.

The SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 (“SAB 118”), provides a measurement period that should not extend
beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740,
Income Taxes. At November 30, 2018, OMNOVA had provisionally estimated minimal income inclusion for the
transition tax related to foreign earnings on which U.S. income taxes were previously deferred. Under SAB 118
guidance, OMNOVA adjusted the income inclusion related to transition tax to $27.7 million. The change is a
result of additional analysis, changes in interpretation and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance
that was issued. As of February 28, 2019, OMNOVA completed the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in
accordance with the SAB 118 and there were no further impacts. OMNOVA utilized existing net operating loss
carryforwards to offset the income inclusion, and therefore had no cash taxes related to the transition tax during
2019

_Specialty Solutions_

Specialty Solutions’ net sales increased by $25.4 million, or 5.2%, to $513.0 million for the financial year ended
November 30, 2019, compared to $487.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. The increased
sales were primarily driven by OMNOVA Portugal, which accounted for $48.0 million of the sales increase as
well as improved volumes of $27.5 million, and price and mix of $4.8 million, which were slightly offset by
unfavorable foreign exchange translation losses of $6.9 million. Volume was up in the specialty coatings and
ingredients and oil and gas business lines. Net sales for the specialty coatings and ingredients line increased by
$22.9 million to $274.5 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 compared to $251.6 million for
the financial year ended November 30, 2018. Net sales for the oil and gas business line increased by $13.9 million,
or 19.5%, to $85.2 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, compared to $71.3 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2018. Net sales for the laminates and films line decreased by $11.4 million,
or 6.9%, to $153.3 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, compared to $164.7 million in
financial year ended November 30, 2018.

Specialty Solutions’ operating profit decreased by $4.5 million, or 6.4%, to $66.2 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2019, compared to $70.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. The
decrease in segment operating profit was primarily due to increased operating costs partly due to the inclusion of
OMNOVA Portugal, partly offset by improved volume and price and mix. Segment operating profit includes
items which OMNOVA’s management excludes when evaluating the results of the segments. Those items for the
financial year ended November 30, 2019 totaled $0.7 million and included $0.3 million of acquisition and
integration related expense and $0.4 million of restructuring and severance charges. Those items for the financial
year ended November 30, 2018 totaled $3.7 million and included $1.8 million of acquisition and integration
related expense, $1.2 million of asset impairment, facility closure and other costs, and $0.7 million of restructuring
and severance charges.

_Performance Materials_

Performance Materials’ net sales decreased by $59.0 million, or 20.9%, to $223.2 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2019, compared to $282.2 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. This
decrease was primarily due to lower volume of sales of $48.8 million, unfavorable price and mix of $5.9 million,
and unfavorable foreign currency translation losses of $4.3 million. Net sales for coated fabrics increased by $4.2
million, or 9.5%, to $48.5 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, compared to $44.3 million for
the financial year ended November 30, 2018, primarily due to customer wins and increased participation in OEM

automotive and transportation end markets. Net sales for performance additives decreased by $13.7 million, or
11.0%, to $110.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 compared to $124.3 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2018, primarily due to competitive pressures in the antioxidant and tire cord
markets. Net sales for paper and carpet decreased by $49.5 million, or 43.6%, to $64.1 million for the financial
year ended November 30, 2019 compared to $113.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018,
primarily due to lower volume of sales as a result of OMNOVA’s exit from the commodity paper business line
and reduced volumes in the commodity carpet market.

Segment operating loss increased by $6.0 million to $15.8 million for the financial year ended November 30,
2019, compared to operating loss of $9.8 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to an asset impairment charge of $7.8 million for the write down of two trade names related to
the performance additives business line. Segment operating profit includes items which OMNOVA management
excludes when evaluating the results of OMNOVA’s segments. Those items for the financial year ended
November 30, 2019 totaled $9.6 million and include $10.7 million of asset impairment, facility closure costs and
other, $2.2 million of restructuring and severance, $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation, which were partly
offset by a $4.4 million gain on sale of assets. Those items for 2018 totaled $16.7 million and include asset
impairments, facility, and other costs of $14.3 million, accelerated depreciation of $1.1 million, restructuring and
severance of $1.1 million and environmental charges of $0.2 million.

_Corporate Expenses_

Corporate expenses decreased by $2.9 million, or 12.1%, to $21.1 million for the financial year ended November
30, 2019, compared to $24.0 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. This decrease was primarily
due to lower incentive compensation expenses.

**_Comparison of the financial years ended November 30, 2017 and 2018_**

_Net Sales_

OMNOVA’s net sales for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 were $769.8 million, a decrease of $13.3
million, or 1.7%, compared to $783.1 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. The acquisition of
Resiquímica in September 2018 accounted for $10.7 million of current year sales, while OMNOVA’s former
China-based coated fabric manufacturing operation, CCF, which was sold in July of 2017, accounted for $10.4
million in sales in 2017.

Excluding the effect of the disposal of CCF, sales decreased $2.9 million or 0.4%. The Specialty Solutions
business segment revenue increased 10.5% and the Performance Materials business segment revenue decreased
by 17.4%. Contributing to the net sales decrease of $2.9 million were lower volumes of $30.5 million, which was
partly offset by a favorable foreign exchange of $14.7 million and favorable price and mix of $2.5 million.

_Gross Profit_

OMNOVA’s gross profit for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 was $190.7 million, a decrease of $10.1
million, or 5.0%, compared to $200.8 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. Gross profit margin
decreased to 24.8% for the financial year ended November 30, 2018, from 25.6% for the financial year ended
November 30, 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower volumes, primarily within
Performance Materials. Volume decreased primarily due to OMNOVA’s continued strategic transition away from
the commodity paper coatings sector, and the sale of CCF, which were partly offset by improved volume in oil
and gas, coatings and performance additives.

_Selling, general and administrative expenses_

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by $12.0 million, or 10.2%, to $106.2 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $118.2 million for the financial year ended November 30,
2017. This decrease was primarily due to the One OMNOVA cost reduction initiatives and reductions in outside
services and incentive compensation.

142


-----

_Tax_

Income tax benefit was $6.2 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018, compared to income tax
expense of $83.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017.

The 2018 income tax benefit was different than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to items related to the
Tax Act. As a result of the Tax Act, OMNOVA recorded a provisional net tax benefit of approximately $9.9
million, comprised of: a tax benefit of $4.1 million related to the re-measurement of the U.S. deferred taxes for
the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; a tax benefit of $0.9 million associated with the reversal
of the valuation allowance against the existing AMT credit carryforward as it is refundable under the Tax Act;
and a tax benefit of $4.9 million associated with the reversal of the valuation allowance on a portion of the U.S.
deferred tax assets as a result of deferred tax liabilities for indefinite lived intangible assets now considered
available as a source of income as a result of the Tax Act. In addition, OMNOVA recognized a $0.9 million
income tax benefit related to the impact of a French tax rate change on OMNOVA’s deferred tax liabilities.

The 2017 income tax expense was higher than the statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of a $79.9
million income tax expense related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Of that amount, $75.7 million
income tax expense was recorded in the U.S. during the three months ended November 30, 2017. Additionally, a
$19.6 million goodwill impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 for which no tax benefit was
realized as the goodwill impairment is permanently non-deductible for tax purposes. The tax impact of the
goodwill impairment was $6.9 million. These charges were partly offset by a $3.4 million income tax benefit from
French legislative changes during the year.

Specialty Solutions

Specialty Solutions’ net sales increased by $46.2 million, or 10.5%, to $487.6 million for the financial year ended
November 30, 2018, compared to $441.4 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017.

The acquisition of Resiquímica accounted for $10.7 million of the increase. The increased sales were primarily
driven by improved volumes of $25.9 million, price and mix of $11.3 million, and favorable foreign exchange of
$9.0 million. Volume was up in specialty coatings and ingredients, oil and gas, and laminates and films. Net sales

for the specialty coatings and ingredients line increased by $20.3 million, or 8.8%, to $251.6 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $231.3 million for the financial year ended November 30,
2017. Net sales for the oil and gas line increased by $16.7 million, or 30.6%, to $71.3 million for the financial
year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $54.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. Net
sales for the laminates and films line increased by $9.2 million, or 5.9%, to $164.7 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2018, compared to $155.5 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017.

Specialty Solutions’ operating profit increased by $10.8 million, or 18.0%, to $70.7 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2018, compared to $59.9 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. This
increase was primarily due to increased volume, cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign exchange, and
improved price and mix, partly offset by higher raw material and operating costs. Segment operating profit
includes items which OMNOVA’s management excludes when evaluating the results of the segments. Those
items for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 totaled $3.7 million and included $1.8 million of acquisition
and integration related expense, $1.2 million of asset impairment, facility closure and other costs, and $0.7 million
of restructuring and severance charges. Those items for the financial year ended November 30, 2017 totaled $0.9
million and included $0.6 million of restructuring and severance charges and $0.3 million of operational
improvement costs.

Performance Materials

Performance Materials’ net sales decreased by $59.5 million, or 17.4%, to $282.2 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2018, compared to $341.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. During
the financial year ended November 30, 2017, OMNOVA sold CCF which accounted for $10.4 million of net sales
in 2017. The decrease of $59.5 million was primarily due to lower volume of $46.0 million, the divestiture of
CCF of $10.4 million, and unfavorable price and mix of $8.8 million, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange
of $5.7 million. Volumes were down, primarily in Paper, due to OMNOVA’s exit of the commodity paper
business. Net sales for performance additives increased $4.8 million to $106.0 million for the financial year ended
November 30, 2018 compared to $101.2 million in the prior year. Coated fabrics’ net sales decreased $10.9 million
to $44.3 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $55.2 million in the prior year,
primarily due to the sale of CCF. Paper and carpet net sales decreased $52.9 million to $113.6 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $166.5 million in the prior year.

Performance Materials’ operating losses decreased by $2.8 million, or 22.2%, to $9.8 million for the financial
year ended November 30, 2018, compared to operating losses of $12.6 million for the financial year ended
November 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to an asset impairment charge of $9.2 million related to the
SB production transition from Green Bay, Wisconsin to Mogadore, Ohio, to offset the impact from lower volumes
within OMNOVA’s commodity paper business. Segment operating profit includes items which OMNOVA’s
management excludes when evaluating the results of OMNOVA’s segments. Those items for 2018 totaled $16.7
million and include asset impairments, facility, and other costs of $14.3 million, accelerated depreciation of $1.1
million, restructuring and severance of $1.1 million and environmental charges of $0.2 million. Those items for
2017 totaled $33.3 million and include asset impairment charges and facility closure costs of $33.6 million,
restructuring and severance costs of $1.7 million, and a reversal of an environmental charge of $2.0 million.

_Interest and corporate expenses_

Interest expense decreased by $2.2 million, or 10.2%, to $19.3 million for the financial year ended November 30,
2018, compared to $21.5 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily
due to the $40.0 million OMNOVA Term Loan B prepayment made during the first quarter of the financial year
ended November 30, resulting in a lower average outstanding debt balance in the financial year compared to the
prior year.

Corporate expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 2.0%, to $24.0 million for the financial year ended November
30, 2018, compared to $24.5 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily
due to lower incentive compensation expense and outside service costs.

**_Management Adjusted Consolidated Results_**

For the financial year ended November 30, 2019, segment operating profit was $1.1 million, compared to $33.8
million in the prior year. The 2019 results included $38.6 million of items primarily related to a restructuring of
OMNOVA’s European holding company structure, costs relating to OMNOVA’s proposed merger with
Synthomer, severance and restructuring, accelerated depreciation, and intangible asset impairment costs. The 2018
results included $23.5 million of items primarily related to asset impairment charges, costs for the closure of
OMNOVA’s Green Bay, Wisconsin facility, and OMNOVA Portugal acquisition costs. Adjusted Segment
Operating Profit, excluding those items, was $19.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019,
compared to $38.0 million for the prior year. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share were $0.33 for 2019, compared
to $0.63 in the previous year.

Adjusted EBITDA was $70.0 million for 2019, compared to $86.3 million for 2018. Adjusted Segment EBITDA
was down for Specialty Solutions, at $86.1 million for 2019 compared to $92.0 million in the prior year. Adjusted
Segment EBITDA for Performance Materials declined by $13.6 million, from $18.1 million at the end of
November 2018 to $4.5 million at the end of November 2019. The decline primarily reflects the impact of
OMNOVA’s decision to exit the commodity paper market, volume weakness in the carpet market and weakness
in the tire cord market.

During 2019, OMNOVA experienced broad economic pressures in Asia and in the U.S. recreational vehicle
markets, which resulted in lower demand in several key markets including recreational vehicles, construction,
automotive and tires.

**_Management Adjusted Specialty Solutions Segment Results_**

For the financial year ended November 30, 2019, Specialty Solutions operating profit was $66.2 million,
compared with $70.7 million in the prior year. Specialty Solutions adjusted segment operating profit for 2019 was
$66.5 million, or 13.0% of net sales, compared to $74.4 million, or 15.3% of net sales, for the comparable period
for the financial year ended November 30, 2018. The period-to-period decline was the result of a slow start to the
year in nonwovens, declines in elastomeric modifiers related to a slow Asian market and weaker automotive
markets generally, as well as overall weakness in laminates and films (particularly in recreational vehicles). While
the oil and gas business line’s contribution to Specialty Solutions adjusted segment operating profit was up by
approximately 40% from the prior period, it was not sufficient to offset the aforementioned declines.

In 2019, OMNOVA’s vitality index for Specialty Solutions is 20.7%, up from 19.3% in 2018. Profit margins from
OMNOVA’s new product portfolio in Specialty Solutions has increased by 340 basis points and is now accretive
to overall specialty margins.

**_Management Adjusted Performance Materials Segment Results_**

Performance Materials’ segment operating loss for 2019 was $15.8 million, compared with a loss of $9.8 million
for the prior year. Performance Materials Adjusted Segment Operating Loss in 2019 was $5.8 million, compared
to income of $6.9 million in the prior year. The primary drivers of the decline are consistent with those of the
quarter, and were partly offset by the benefits of closing OMNOVA’s Green Bay, Wisconsin plant.

The challenges in commodity-based markets like paper and carpet continue to mask the more positive performance
of OMNOVA’s smaller but more profitable Performance Materials business lines, including OMNOVA’s coated
fabrics and reinforcing resins business lines. The segment is continuing to execute its strategy of growing the
profitable Performance Materials business lines while reducing exposure to less profitable business lines through
reducing direct costs, repurposing assets, and reducing exposure in the segment’s most commoditized end
markets.

_Operating Activities_

Cash used in operating activities amounted to $7.3 million for the three months ended February 29, 2020,
compared to $8.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The $1.0 million increase for the three
months ended February 29, 2020 was primarily due to lower year-over-year operating loss.

Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $24.4 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019,
compared to $56.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $47.8 million for the financial
year ended November 30, 2017. The $32.3 million decrease for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 was
primarily due to lower earnings and unfavorable working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating

146


-----

activities for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 compared to the prior year was due to higher earnings
after consideration of non-cash items and improved working capital.

_Investing Activities_

Cash used in investing activities amounted to $4.0 million for the three months ended February 29, 2020,
compared to $10.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019. The $6.2 million decrease for the three
months ended February 29, 2020 was primarily due higher capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 due to
the transfer of styrene butadiene manufacturing from its Green Bay, Wisconsin plant to its Mogadore, Ohio plant
and a working capital settlement payment for the OMNOVA Portugal acquisition of approximately $2.8 million
in the same period.

Cash used in investing activities amounted to $30.3 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019,
compared to $46.0 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $28.6 million for the financial
year ended November 30, 2017. The $15.7 million decrease for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 was
driven primarily by the acquisition of OMNOVA Portugal in 2018 for $22.8 million, and the sale of the Green
Bay, Wisconsin facility and equipment for $4.9 million, partly offset by higher capital expenditures in 2019 of
$9.3 million.

Included in the table for the financial year ended November 30, 2019 are capital expenditures of $33.1 million.
Included in the table for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 are capital expenditures of $23.8 million,
primarily related to manufacturing equipment, and the acquisition of OMNOVA Portugal. Included in the table
for the financial year ended November 30, 2017 are capital expenditures of $25.1 million, primarily related to
manufacturing equipment, and acquisition and disposal of businesses of $7.3 million partly offset by the collection
of a $3.8 million note receivable.

_Financing_

Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $1.6 million for the three months ended February 29, 2020,
compared to cashed used in financing activities of $2.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019.
The 3.9 million increase for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was primarily due to additional borrowings
on the OMNOVA Revolving Credit Facility.

Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $2.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019,
compared to cash used of $42.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $6.6 million for the
financial year ended November 30, 2017. The $45.3 million improvement for the financial year ended November
30, 2019 was driven primarily by a $40.0 million debt repayment on the OMNOVA Term Loan B in 2018. Cash
used in financing activities amounted to $42.7 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018, and was
due primarily to debt repayments of $66.2 million and borrowings of $24.3 million. Cash used in financing
activities amounted to $6.6 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2017 and was due primarily to debt
repayments of $4.2 million and $2.2 million of common shares redeemed in the repayment of employees
withholding taxes.

Gross debt was $332.5 million as at November 30, 2019, which included $298.6 million under the OMNOVA
Term Loan B, $19.0 million under the OMNOVA Revolving Credit Facility and $14.9 million of capital lease
obligations. In the previous year, OMNOVA’s gross debt totaled $329.7 million as at November 30, 2018.
OMNOVA made a $40 million prepayment on the outstanding OMNOVA Term Loan B balance during the first
quarter of financial year 2018. OMNOVA’s cash balance of $50.9 million at November 30, 2019 consists of $10.5
million in the U.S., $14.2 million in Europe, and $26.2 million in Asia.

**Critical Accounting Judgements**

This discussion and analysis of OMNOVA’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are based
upon OMNOVA’s consolidated financial statements as at November 30, 2019, which have been prepared in
accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required OMNOVA to
make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of the consolidated financial statements.
Periodically, OMNOVA reviews its estimates and judgements including those related to product returns, accounts
receivable, inventories, litigation, environmental reserves, pensions, and income taxes. OMNOVA bases its
estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

The following critical accounting policies affect OMNOVA’s more significant estimates and assumptions used in
the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

**_Revenue Recognition_**

OMNOVA recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to customers, in an amount that
reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods in accordance with ASC 606. When
recognizing revenue, OMNOVA applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a
customer, (2) identify the performance obligations, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is
satisfied.

**_Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**

OMNOVA’s policy is to identify customers that are considered doubtful of collection based upon the customer’s
financial condition, payment history, credit rating and other relevant factors; and reserves the portion of such
accounts receivable for which collection does not appear likely. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.4
million, $3.3 million and $2.9 million at November 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

**_Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence_**

OMNOVA’s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified,
discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and forecasted
usage and sales levels. A sudden and unexpected change in design trends and/or material preferences could impact

148


-----

the carrying value of OMNOVA’s inventory and require OMNOVA to increase its reserve for obsolescence. The
reserve for inventory obsolescence was $6.1 million, $6.9 million and $6.4 million at November 30, 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively.

**_Litigation and Environmental Reserves_**

From time to time, OMNOVA is subject to claims, lawsuits, and proceedings related to product liability, product
warranty, contract, employment, environmental, and other matters. OMNOVA provides a reserve for such matters
when it concludes a material loss is probable and the amount can be estimated. Costs related to environmental
compliance are also accrued when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated.

**_Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Plans_**

OMNOVA accounts for its pension and other post-retirement plans by recognizing in its balance sheet the
overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans, measured as the difference between
the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement plans). OMNOVA recognizes the change
in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). As of May 2007, OMNOVA’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan has been closed to all new hires
and since December 1, 2011, future service benefits have been frozen and fully vested for all participants.
Therefore, there is no future service benefit accrual for OMNOVA’s U.S. defined benefit plans.

The most significant elements in determining OMNOVA’s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets
and the discount rate. The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets,
which changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. This produces the expected
return on plan assets that is included in pension (expense) income. For OMNOVA’s U.S. plan, the difference
between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the estimated
remaining life expectancy of plan participants. The net deferral of past asset gains (losses) affects the calculated
value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension (expense) income.

OMNOVA recorded pension expense of $2.0 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, $1.3
million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $2.1 million for the financial year ended November
30, 2017. Pension expense is calculated using the discount rate to discount plan liabilities at the prior year
measurement date. Discount rates of 4.41%, 3.66% and 4.12% were used to calculate the pension expense in the
financial years ended November 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. OMNOVA anticipates financial year
2020 expense to be approximately $1.2 million based on a weighted average discount rate of 3.07%. An increase
or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense on an annual basis by
approximately $0.1 million. Cash contributions to the pension plans were $6.5 million, $6.3 million and $7.6
million in the financial years ended November 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

OMNOVA, in consultation with its actuary, determined the discount rate used to discount the U.S. plan liabilities
at the plan’s measurement date, which was November 30, 2019. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which
the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In determining the discount rate,
OMNOVA used spot rates on a yield curve matching benefit payments to determine the weighted average discount
rate that would be applied in determining the benefit obligation at November 30, 2019. Changes in discount rates,
as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). OMNOVA, in consultation with its actuary, determined the
discount rate used to measure defined benefit pension plan obligations as of November 30, 2019 should be 3.07%,
compared to 4.41% as of November 30, 2018 and 3.66% as of November 30, 2017. A 25 basis point change in
the discount rate would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately $7.7 million.

OMNOVA utilizes an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying interest and service
costs using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the
relevant projected cash flows. The spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for the financial year
ended November 30, 2019 ranged from 3.28% to 4.85%. The ultimate spot rate used to discount cash flows beyond
30 years was 4.83% for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. The spot rates used to determine service and
interest costs for financial year 2020 expense ranged from 2.05% to 3.61%. The ultimate spot rate used to discount
cash flows beyond 30 years was 3.61% for financial year 2020.

149


-----

The use of disaggregated discount rates results in a different amount of interest cost compared to the traditional
single weighted-average discount rate approach because of different weightings given to each subset of payments.
The use of disaggregated discount rates affects the amount of service cost because the benefit payments associated
with new service credits for active employees tend to be of longer duration than the overall benefit payments
associated with the plan’s benefit obligation. As a result, the payments would be associated with longer-term spot
rates on the yield curve, resulting in lower present values than the calculations using the traditional single
weighted-average discount rate.

OMNOVA uses the Mercer modified version of the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2014 mortality table for the
preretirement mortality base table. OMNOVA also uses the Mercer Industry Longevity Experience Study table
for the chemical, oil and gas and utilities industry and the consumer goods and food & drink industry for the postretirement mortality base table. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption,
OMNOVA, in consultation with its actuary, considered the historical returns and the future expectations for
returns for each asset class, as well as the target allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection
of a long-term rate of return on assets assumption of 7.68% for each of the financial years ended November 30,
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The measurement dates of November 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were used to
determine these rates. A 25 basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease
pension expense by approximately $0.5 million. Pension plan assets are measured at fair value or at net asset value
for certain collective trusts on the measurement date.

Based on current estimates of pension asset performance, interest and discount rate assumptions, OMNOVA
expects it will be required to make a cash contributions to its pension plans of $6.6 million in 2020.

Factors that could impact future cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are:

- investment returns which differ materially from OMNOVA’s 7.68 % return assumption for financial year
2020;

- significant changes in interest rates, affecting the discount rate; and

- opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum
required schedule. Voluntary contributions in excess of minimally required amounts may prevent the
need for larger contributions in the future.

Voluntary contributions in excess of minimally required amounts may prevent the need for larger contributions
in the future.

**_Income Taxes_**

OMNOVA follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period the differences are expected to reverse.
OMNOVA records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of all available
positive and negative evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities along with
OMNOVA’s effective tax rate in the future.

A high degree of judgement is required to determine the extent a valuation allowance should be provided against
deferred tax assets. On a quarterly basis, OMNOVA assesses the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets
considering all available evidence, both positive and negative. In determining whether a valuation allowance is
warranted, OMNOVA evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and
carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a
deferred tax asset. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to
which the evidence may be objectively verified. It is generally difficult to outweigh objectively verifiable negative
evidence of cumulative financial reporting losses.

As a result of historical restructuring charges and impairments over the last few years, including significant
goodwill impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2017, OMNOVA

150


-----

entered into a U.S. jurisdiction three-year cumulative loss position for the three year period ended November
2017. OMNOVA considered sources of positive evidence, including OMNOVA’s year over year growth in its
core earnings, expected future earnings, which if realized would enable OMNOVA to utilize its net operating loss
carryforwards, and a recent history of net operating loss utilization. A cumulative loss position is considered
significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset that is difficult to overcome when
determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Based on the weight of all available positive and negative
evidence, OMNOVA established a valuation allowance of $73.1 million in the fourth quarter of the financial year
ended November 30, 2017 on its U.S. deferred tax assets.

In addition, a $3.3 million valuation allowance was established on a capital loss incurred in the U.S. on the stock
sale of a foreign subsidiary during the third quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2017. For the three
year period ended November 2018, the U.S. jurisdiction remains in a three-year cumulative loss position.
Considering the weight of available positive and negative evidence, OMNOVA does not believe the positive
evidence (some of which is subjective) overcomes the negative objective evidence of a 3-year cumulative loss
position. Therefore, OMNOVA concludes that the valuation allowance should remain on its U.S. deferred tax
assets as of November 30, 2018. OMNOVA has not provided for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings on
certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as such amounts are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As a
result of the Tax Act, to the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are
repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability primarily attributable to withholding taxes may be creditable. However,
based on OMNOVA’s policy of permanent reinvestment, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income
tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested. As of November
30, 2019, the non-U.S. subsidiaries have cumulative foreign retained earnings of $50.2 million.

OMNOVA utilizes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. For those benefits
to be recognized, an income tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing
authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not of
being realized upon ultimate settlement.

OMNOVA’s accounting policy for interest and/or penalties related to underpayments of income taxes is to include
interest and penalties in income tax expense. For the financial year ended November 30, 2019, OMNOVA
recognized minimal income tax expense related to interest and penalties. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was
signed into law which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate effective from January
1, 2018, from 35% to 21%; repealed the AMT; imposed a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings
not previously subject to U.S. taxation; provides a U.S. federal tax exemption on future distributions of foreign
earnings; and beginning in financial year 2019, creates a new minimum tax on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by
certain foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with US GAAP, any potential impacts of GILTI can either be treated
as a period expense in the period incurred or considered in the determination of OMNOVA’s deferred tax
balances. OMNOVA will account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

OMNOVA uses the fair value method of accounting to record share-based compensation based on the grant date
fair value. While OMNOVA regularly evaluates the use of share-based compensation, its practice has been to
issue restricted shares or restricted share units, which are required to be expensed using the fair value method.
Beginning with grants in 2018, OMNOVA determined that its performance share awards would vest and be paid
in OMNOVA common shares. The fair value of performance share awards, restricted share awards and restricted
share units is determined based on the closing market price of OMNOVA’s common shares at the date of grant.
Refer to Note N to OMNOVA’s consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended November 30, 2019
and Note O to OMNOVA’s consolidate financial statements for each of the years ended November 30, 2018 and
2017 for further discussion of share-based compensation, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Long-Lived Assets_**

Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and finite-lived intangibles are stated at historical cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization.

151


-----

Construction in process (“CIP”) is not depreciated until the asset is placed in service. Refurbishment costs that
extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized, whereas ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed as
incurred. Interest expense incurred during the construction phase is capitalized as part of CIP until the relevant
projects are completed and placed into service.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of
the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated disposal price
less costs to sell. Depreciation ceases for assets meeting the held-for-sale criteria.

During the financial year ended November 30, 2018, OMNOVA’s board of directors approved a plan to close the
Green Bay, Wisconsin plant shifting styrene butadiene manufacturing to its production plant in Mogadore, Ohio.
As a result, OMNOVA determined that certain plant and equipment were impaired and recognized an impairment
charge of $9.2 million, primarily in the Performance Materials segment, to write-down the asset group to fair
value based on the market approach analysis. The plant and equipment was sold in 2019 for $4.9 million,
recognizing a gain of $4.4 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. Also during the financial year
ended November 30, 2018, OMNOVA recognized other asset impairment charges of $2.7 million related to idled
assets.

During the fourth quarter of the financial year ended November 30, 2017, due to anticipated lower volumes in the
paper sector, OMNOVA performed an impairment analysis of the related asset group. Based on this analysis, it
was determined that the fair value of the asset group was in excess of the book value, and accordingly, OMNOVA
concluded no impairment was necessary. During the second quarter of the financial year ended November 30,
2017, in connection with the pending sale of the CCF operations, OMNOVA recognized an additional impairment
charge of $12.8 million to write down the asset group to the contract sale price which approximated fair value.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a business combination. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least
annually as of September 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. OMNOVA performs the impairment analysis at the reporting unit level using a two-step impairment
test. The first step identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with
its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using a market approach method or a discounted cash flow
analysis based on level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy, which requires OMNOVA to estimate future cash
flows anticipated to be generated by the reporting unit, as well as a discount rate to measure the present value of
the anticipated cash flows. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is
not considered impaired and the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the
estimated fair value, the second step calculates the possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of
goodwill with the carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an
impairment charge is recognized. As of November 30, 2019, the estimated fair value of OMNOVA’s reporting
units exceeded the carrying value of goodwill and therefore, no impairment was recorded.

The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of comparing the fair value of the asset with its
carrying value. OMNOVA estimates the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a fair value model
based on a market approach method or discounted future cash flows. If the carrying amounts exceed the estimated
fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the excess. Key inputs used in determining
the fair value of the trademarks/trade names were expected future revenues and royalty rates, and accordingly,
their fair value is impacted by selling prices, which for OMNOVA is based in part on raw material costs. As of
September 1, 2019, OMNOVA performed its annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets and
determined that the carrying value of two individual trade names within the Performance Materials segment were
greater than their fair value and, accordingly, recorded an impairment of $7.8 million. A sensitivity analysis was
performed by OMNOVA on one of these trade names and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the discount
rate used to value this tradename would result in additional impairment of $0.6 million. The second tradename

152


-----

had no remaining fair value. Trademarks and trade names continue to be important to OMNOVA, and OMNOVA
continues to focus on long-term growth, however, if recent trends continue, the long-term assumptions relative to
growth rates and profitability of the trademarks and trade names may not be attained, which could result in
additional impairment to one or more of OMNOVA’s trademarks and trade names.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgements and assumptions by Management including sales,
operating margins, royalty rates, discount rates, and future economic conditions. To the extent that the reporting
unit is unable to achieve these assumptions, impairment losses may occur.

Finite lived intangible assets, such as customer lists, patents, certain trademarks/trade names, and licenses, are
recorded at cost or estimated fair value when acquired as part of a business combination. Intangible assets with a
finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives with periods ranging from 3 to 53 years.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

The financial position and results of operations of OMNOVA’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local
currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of operations denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are
translated at the weighted average exchange rates each month during the year. The resulting translation gains and
losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are excluded
from net income until realized through a sale or liquidation of the investment.

**_Leasing Arrangements_**

Operating lease expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term, including any
optional renewal terms that are reasonably expected to be exercised. Leasehold improvements related to these
operating leases are amortized over the estimated useful life or the non-cancellable lease term, whichever is
shorter. Capital leases are recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of future minimum lease
payments with a corresponding amount recorded in property, plant, and equipment. Current portions of capital
lease payments are included in amounts due banks and noncurrent capital lease obligations are included in longterm debt in OMNOVA’s consolidated balance sheets.

**Financial Risk Management**

OMNOVA is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long-term debt as of November 30,
2019. As described in Note L to OMNOVA’s consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended
November 30, 2019, the OMNOVA Term Loan B, OMNOVA Revolving Credit Facility, and OMNOVA’s
eurodollar revolving loan bears interest at variable rates. OMNOVA had $317.6 million of variable rate debt as
of November 30, 2019. The weighted average effective interest rate of OMNOVA’s outstanding debt was 5.48%
for the financial year ended November 30, 2019. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points would impact
OMNOVA’s interest expense on its variable rate debt by approximately $3.2 million annually.

OMNOVA is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. OMNOVA has accumulated currency translation
losses of $19.0 million as of November 30, 2019, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).

OMNOVA does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In North America, acrylics (dispersions) accounted for over 50% of latex consumption by volume, including pure
acrylics (31%), vinyl acrylics (15%) and styrene acrylics (13.5%), in 2017. SBR accounted for 13.8% of the North
American market for synthetic latex polymers in 2018.

Paints and coatings were the leading end market in North America, followed by adhesives and sealants, with 40%
and 17%, respectively, of synthetic latex polymer consumption in the region in 2018.

**_Middle East_**

Styrene acrylics (dispersions) were the largest consumed latex polymer in the Middle East in 2017, due to their
high use in the paints and coatings industry. Paints and coatings were the leading application in the Middle East
market, followed by adhesives and sealants, with approximately 34% and 20%, respectively, of consumption of
synthetic polymer latex in the region in 2017. Ongoing infrastructure and real estate development projects in the
Middle East should lead to an increase in the demand for synthetic latex polymers in the construction, paints and
coatings and adhesives and sealants industries.

**_South East Asia_**

NBR was the leading synthetic latex polymer used in Southeast Asia in 2017, representing 45% of the market by

Kline estimates.

**_Product Market Growth and Outlook_**

The growth drivers of each of our product types, NBR, SBR, dispersions and specialities, across end markets and
geographic regions are supported by the population growth, urbanization, ageing population, energy conservation
and environmental consciousness mega-trends. Due to our balanced product mix and our global asset footprint,
with exposure to both emerging and developed markets, we are well placed to capture market growth.

**End Markets, Market Share and Outlook for Our Three Segments**

**_Performance Elastomers (NBR and SBR)_**

_NBR_

NBR products are used in the manufacture of dipped products for medical applications, the largest being protective
gloves for medical, industrial and household applications. We offer a range of NBR products for use in the
manufacture of thin walled gloves for medical and laboratory use and heavy duty gloves for household and
industrial applications. NBR latex products are sold globally to gloves manufacturers, including both large
diversified medical and consumer goods companies and smaller niche manufacturers.

NBR competes with PVC and natural rubber in this market. The potential for natural rubber to cause allergies due
to a naturally occurring protein among some glove wearers is leading to increased substitution by NBR.

We have developed innovative self-cross linking nitrile latex that eliminates the need for accelerators which
improves the benefit and reduces any risk in use for glove wearers. In September 2017, we launched a proprietary
patented SyNovus Nitrile latex product, which provides additional value-add to its customers reflecting higher
plant run-rates and lower energy costs.

-----

We have the second-largest market share globally with approximately 22% market share as of 2019. Our largest
competitors are Kumho Petrochemicals, LG and Nantex, which had 32%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of the
global market as of 2019. NBR market growth from 2010 to 2020 averaged greater than 8% per annum due to
superior chemistry and performance versus natural latex and PVC. The outlook for demand is in line with strong
growth due to the hygiene megatrend and growth in use of emerging markets, with growth forecast to average 8%
to 10% per annum.

_SBR_

SBR is sold primarily to the speciality segments of the paper, construction, textile and floor coverings markets, as
well as adhesives and foams.

In coated paper applications, the addition of a latex coating contributes to the quality of the end product by
providing gloss, smoothness, fiber coverage, stiffness and brightness for various types of paper and board.
Furthermore, latex assists the processability and/or runability of the coating color. SBR is the dominant binder in
the paper industry.

In construction applications, SBR is used as an additive in cement and asphalt to improve tensile strength and
ductility and enhance resistance to water and other solvents, thereby prolonging the useful life of the asphalt or
cement.

In textile applications, SBR is used as a binder for non-woven fabrics such as those used in filters, wipes and
home furnishings. SBR provides the fabric with added softness, stiffness and strength. In addition, SBR is used
in upholstery back-coatings to improve shape and strength.

In the floor coverings market, SBR is widely used in the back-coating of carpets where the latex acts as an adhesive
for a secondary backing, holding the fibers in place and giving stability and strength to the carpet. Products for
the carpet industry are sold both directly to carpet manufacturers (a large number of which are located within the
Benelux region) and to intermediaries who provide ready-to use blends to smaller customers.

Adhesives applications include tapes, labels and envelopes.

Latex foam is mainly used in mattresses, pillow and manifold cushioning materials, with the entire spectrum of this
varied product largely addressed through the use of different high solid SBR grades (HS-SBR latex), in order to
apply different degrees of firmness and elasticity to these products to suit consumer’s needs. Other applications
include uses in footwear, such as for inner soles.

The market growth for SBR approximately reflects growth in GDP, with uses in particular end markets reflecting
the growth of those end markets. SBR uses in paper latex markets have declined by approximately 1% to 4% per
annum since 2010, as consumers shift from paper-based to electronic media. This has been partly offset by growth
in foam, construction, compounds, packaging and cardboard markets.

We are focused on high value segments within the SBR business, as well as driving network efficiencies, which
will enable us to mitigate the effects of these sector tailwinds. We have the largest market share in Europe with
41% of the market as of 2019. Our nearest competitors are Trinseo and BASF, which have 25% and 17%,
respectively, of the SBR market in Europe as of 2019 according to Kline and internal company estimates.

**_Functional Solutions (Dispersions)_**

Dispersion products are sold predominantly to paint and coatings manufacturers and formulators of adhesives and
construction products (such as sealants, fillers and caulks) with exposure to globally growing market segments.
Strong application know-how is required to support this commercial offering.

There are continued significant regulatory drivers preventing change that support water-based technologies across
end-markets, since water-based products tend to have lower levels of VOCs than solvent-based products. There is
a general trend in the industry towards producing more eco-friendly products by eliminating VOCs from coatings
and adhesives formulations, since VOCs can contribute to climate change and have unfavorable toxicological and
odor characteristics. Acrylic, styrene-acrylic and vinyl dispersions contain significantly lower levels of VOCs
than solvent borne coatings formulations.

156

Our range of acrylic dispersions includes products for use in emulsion surface coatings, primers, interior and
exterior wood varnishes, floor paints and roof coatings. In addition, we supply dispersions for use in adhesives
for flooring, wood, packaging and wallpaper applications.

Our range of styrene-acrylic dispersions is focused on products for use in interior and exterior emulsion paints
and roof coatings and also has applications in packaging adhesives.

Our range of vinyl acetate dispersions includes products for applications in interior and exterior emulsion coatings
and adhesives for packaging, tiles & wood and sealants for construction applications.

The European dispersions competitive landscape is fragmented, with the annual capacity of most producers
amounting to less than 30 kilotonnes. We have the largest market share in Europe and the Middle East with
approximately 15% as of 2019. Our largest competitors, Wacker, BASF and Celanese, each have approximately
11% of the market share. The market growth for dispersions across chemistry types is approximately at GDP+.
The outlook for demand in Europe and North America is positive and growing with environmental regulations
driving an industry shift toward water-based products, which further strengthens their underlying growth trends.
In Southeast Asia, the market growth forecast remains strong, while the Middle East construction sector remains
subdued.

**_Industrial Specialities (including Acrylates)_**

Industrial Specialities products are used in high performance markets such as the automotive sector, PVC
manufacturing, construction and polymer manufacturing. This sector is characterized by innovation and the
development of bespoke solutions for customers with products specified for particular uses. Bespoke products are
“specified” for a particular use, creating barriers for customers to switch products. Our Industrial Specialities
products are used as key formulating components of products in our core markets, which allows us to cross-sell our
specialities products to customers of other products. For example, core products from our Speciality Additives
business are used to enhance the performance of decorative and industrial paints, which is one of the core end
markets served by the Functional Solutions business. The long-standing customer relationships enables us to
develop bespoke solutions for our customers. Given the bespoke nature of many of their specialities products, we
benefit from long customer relationships as customers face high costs for switching suppliers.

The market growth for Industrial Specialities across chemistry types is approximately at GDP+. Their largest
competitors for specialities include BASF, Eastman, Kuraray, Evonik and Oxea.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following are among our key competitive strengths:

**_Global speciality chemicals company with market leading positions across a diverse portfolio_**

We are a global speciality chemicals company and, according to Kline reports published in 2014, 2017 and 2018,
Synthomer has been one of the world’s leading suppliers of water-based polymers, with a number of its product
types holding market-leading positions in Europe, the Middle East and Malaysia. As a speciality chemicals
company, we transform basic raw materials into differentiated chemical formulations that our customers use in a
variety of downstream industries including healthcare, consumer goods and construction. The end products used
in these sectors include medical gloves, dipped latex, coated paper and carpet backing, bedding and footwear,
foams, coatings, adhesives and cement modifiers, among others. As a speciality chemicals producer, we channel
our technical expertise and customer and end market knowledge to help our customers develop these and other
end products. Our long-term customer partners benefit from our knowledge and understanding of their technical
needs, our customer service and our R&D, which has allowed us to develop innovative solutions that help their
business.

Our largest segment by both volumes and revenues is Performance Elastomers, which comprises NBR and SBR
latex products. On both a revenue and volume basis, we are the leading producer of SBR in Europe and the second
largest producer of NBR globally. We are also the leading producer of acrylic and vinylic dispersions in Europe
and the Middle East by both revenue and volume.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s market shares in the European SBR market, the Global NBR
market and the European and Middle East Dispersions markets for the year ended December 31, 2019:

**No.1 player in European Latex** **No.2 player in Global Nitrile** **No.1 player in Europe and Middle**
**(SBR)** **(NBR)** **East Dispersions**

**_Attractive and diverse end markets with a positive outlook_**

Our diversified portfolio of products serve a wide range of geographies and end markets. The markets for each of
these product types are generally well-established, with the largest producers capturing a significant proportion
of the overall market share. We believe that our favorable position in high growth regions such as Asia and our
leading market share in growing product areas such as dispersions and NBR presents us with opportunities for
further growth. We believe we have strong relationships with our long-term customers who benefit from the
expansion of markets that have resulted from years of population growth, longer life expectancies and
urbanization.

There are significant R&D requirements involved in the development of the chemical products we produce and
the end markets they serve. To develop new products, our R&D is driven largely by our ability to apply our
technical know-how, rather than on pure research, hence making it difficult for new and less-established entrants
to compete in these markets and across these product types. Moreover, our products tend to compete not on price

164


-----

but on the quality of the technical service and the end value that these products provide customers. This allows us
to maintain our margins and protect against low-cost market entrants. Our new product development, technical
service and tailored solutions add value to our customers’ end products and helps differentiate us from other
chemicals companies. We anticipate market trends and customer requirements which enables us to deliver
improved products with better margins and differentiation.

Our global geographic footprint, as enhanced by the Acquisition, provides us with exposure to both developed
and emerging markets, with no single country accounting for more than 17.1% of Synthomer’s revenues by
destination for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our products have applications across a diverse
range of end markets such as construction, health and protection, paper, specialities, carpet and foam and
functional polymers such as adhesives and textiles. We have well-established technical and market know-how
relating to our end markets, which support our commercial offering.

The following diagrams illustrate Synthomer’s revenue by product destination and by end market for the year
ended December 31, 2019:

We believe our presence in the end markets for each of our segments is supported by favorable market dynamics.
Our diversified and customer-focused approach enables us to address changing conditions in the end markets of
each of our product types:

- _Performance Elastomers—NBR: The demand for NBR products has been characterized by high growth_
rates in excess of 8% per annum over the past ten years and in line with industry forecasts and the growing
use of hygiene related products we expect this growth to continue in the near future. This growth has
been driven by an increase in demand for disposable gloves as well as a shift towards NBR latex as an
alternative to natural rubber, particularly in light of growing awareness of natural rubber allergies, and
PVC alternatives. This growth in the market has been supported by investment in new low cost capacity,
efficient capacity utilization, innovation and significant intellectual property development. The majority
of our NBR production capacity is strategically located in Malaysia in close proximity to the majority of
the customers of our NBR products, who are mainly manufacturers of disposable gloves and are primarily
concentrated in Southeast Asia. We are also closely integrated with key raw material suppliers to ensure
optionality and security of our raw material supply. Challenges in the NBR market have included ongoing
technical challenges to reduce glove weight and improve product performance properties and increase
availability of new generation products. We have responded to these market dynamics through significant
R&D investment to drive innovation of market-leading products with strong intellectual property
protection. We have also invested in, and continue to invest in, expanding our manufacturing capacity,
including at our Pasir Gudang manufacturing site in Malaysia, to support market growth. As with our
SBR manufacturing facilities, we have focused on driving efficiency and debottlenecking in order to
obtain lower unit manufacturing costs.

- _Performance Elastomers—SBR: The demand for SBR products typically grows in line with GDP. In_
recent years, the product type has seen growth in the construction, packaging and nonwoven end markets,
offsetting the decline in the graphic paper market as customers move to electronic media. The strong
cashflow generated in this business is in part derived by leveraging our advanced manufacturing
technology across our existing manufacturing network while driving efficiency and debottlenecking our
operations in order to minimize unit manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing facilities tend to be located
close to our core customer base in Europe to support logistical requirements and we work closely with
our key raw material suppliers to ensure the security of our raw material supply. In response to the decline

in certain end markets for SBR products, we have focused our business development on high value end
markets such as foam, oil fields and batteries to further diversify our end market exposure. In addition,
we have converted SBR capacity to produce NBR for the fast-growing medical glove market to satisfy
demand and ensure the efficiency of our manufacturing network. Our acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf
in January 2018 capitalized on the opportunity for growth in the packaging and cardboard end market.

- _Functional Solutions—Dispersions: The market for dispersions products has experienced attractive_
industry growth. For example, from 2017 to 2022, the market for dispersions products in Europe is
expected to experience industry growth at a rate in excess of GDP growth, according to a 2018 Kline
report. This growth is underpinned by demographic changes such as population growth, urbanization
and an ageing population as well as the impact of an increasing global focus on energy conservation and
green products. Environmental regulations have been driving a shift from dispersions products that result
in high level of volatile organic compounds, some of which can have harmful effects from a health and
wider environmental impact perspective, towards water-based polymer solutions. The dispersions sector
is characterized by a fragmented competitive landscape in Europe. However, we have been able to
respond to the sector dynamics by leveraging our market-leading technology and well-established
presence through in-house development and strategic acquisitions to develop a broad technology base to
facilitate the manufacture of products with applications in high growth markets. Functional Solutions has
a broader geographical reach than either SBR or NBR, where our activities are concentrated in Europe
and Southeast Asia, respectively, and is a focal point for our R&D to add value to the formulation of our
customers’ products. We have invested significantly in R&D expenditure in order to provide tailored
solutions to our customers and develop innovative water-based products that respond to regulatory
drivers and customer demand.

- _Industrial Specialities: The specialities products’ markets for polymers and speciality chemicals have_
experienced solid industry growth. From 2017 to 2022, the markets for polymers and speciality chemicals
in Europe are expected to grow at a rate in excess of GDP, according to a 2018 Kline report. Specialities
are utilized in high-performance end markets such as the automotive sector, PVC manufacturing,
construction and polymer manufacturing. This sector is characterized by innovation and the development
of bespoke solutions for customers with products specified for particular uses. We have a highly
diversified technology base for speciality products serving a range of high performance application
segments. Our specialities products are used as key formulating components of products in our chosen
core markets, which allows us to cross-sell our specialities products to customers of other products. For
example, core products from our Speciality Additives business are used to enhance the performance of
decorative and industrial paints, which is one of the core end markets served by our dispersions business.
The production of acrylate monomers, both for internal use in our European Functional Solutions
operating segment and for sale to certain external customers for their polymer manufacturing
applications, is reported and is included as a part of the Synthomer Industrial Specialities segment for
the year ended December 31, 2019. Our long-standing customer relationships enable us to develop
bespoke solutions for our customers, which further reinforces these relationships.

**_Blue-chip customer base with long-term established relationships and high barriers to entry_**

Synthomer served approximately 4,300 customers across the world in the year ended December 31, 2019,
including many global blue-chip companies. On a combined basis we served approximately 6,000 customers over
the same period. We believe we have strong and long-term customer relationships, with an average length of 12
years. Our customer base is widespread and well-balanced across geographies and end markets. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer’s largest customer represented approximately 2% of total revenues while
revenues from Synthomer’s twenty largest customers represented 17% of total revenues. On a combined basis for
the same period, our largest customer contributed to 1.5% of our total sales and our largest twenty customers
contributed approximately 20% of our total sales.

**_Well-invested asset base using best practice SHE, manufacturing and fixed cost management_**

We have a global manufacturing footprint utilizing state-of-the-art technology underpinned by our long-term
investment program in strategic sites. We have production facilities across Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle
East and North America, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, France,
Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.

Given that many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content, transportation
and storage of these products can be costly due to the size and weight of water-based products as well as the
hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals. We therefore benefit from our wide-reaching asset base
being located in close proximity to many of our customers.

Our wide-reaching asset base provides us with flexibility of production enabling us to optimize production across
our facilities, such as transferring products from one plant to another to better match customer needs, without the
need to invest in significant capital expenditure. In recent years we have invested capital expenditure into growth
projects intended to expand and enhance our production capabilities and make our processes more efficient. The
growth capital expenditure we invest to expand our onsite capabilities tends to be spread over the same cost base
as our existing capacity, therefore improving cost efficiency by reducing overall cost per tonne.

As part of our “Project Excellence” approach, we aim to ensure all projects are completed safely, on time and
within budget. We focus on ensuring best practice in SHE while delivering high capacity utilization to drive
efficiency. Our aim is to drive profitability through maximum utilization of our assets. This involves identifying
the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. For example, we have undertaken a
phased debottlenecking process at our Marl facility in Germany, where we operate some of the largest batch
reactors in the industry, to increase production of products for the foam end market. In 2019, Synthomer achieved
an important milestone in our SHE practices by recording the first year with no reportable environmental incidents.

We utilize a diversified supplier base of major blue-chip chemical companies—Synthomer’s ten largest suppliers
accounted for 50% of our raw material expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2019, with our largest single
supplier accounting for 10% of our spend on raw materials. The supplier base has widened in recent years, as our
expanded procurement team has improved security of supply and cost-effectiveness by developing links with a
wider number of raw material suppliers, which has proven beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer focused R&D_**

We have an impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer-focused R&D
which supports our strong cash profile. Synthomer maintains four R&D centers including a state-of-the-art U.K.
Innovation Centre, as well as R&D centers in Malaysia, Germany, and the United States. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer invested £16.6 million in R&D and launched 16 new products. These investments
in R&D continue to have a significant effect on Synthomer’s revenues, with 22% of Synthomer’s sales volume
for the year ended December 31, 2019 derived from products that Synthomer developed in the previous five years.
Since 2016, Synthomer has registered 12 new patents. We are committed to quantifying, improving and
communicating the sustainability of all our activities through GRI reporting.

**_Raw material and customer contracts support sustainable and stable margins_**

The speciality nature of our products means that product pricing is based on the value of these products to
customers and the technical service we provide. As a result, we are able to structure our customer agreements in
order to be able to generally pass through increases or decreases in the prices of raw materials. The favorable
structure of our customer agreements limits the impact of raw material cost volatility. For example, in 2017
butadiene prices fluctuated without having a significant impact on our margins due to the structure of our customer
agreements. Approximately one third of Synthomer’s customer agreements, measured by the volume of raw
materials being purchased, are based on agreements which are formulaic, with price-indexed clauses and/or ICISrelated pricing, and therefore allow us to transfer increases in the prices of raw materials to customers, generally
with a one-month time lag, via pass-through provisions. The remainder of Synthomer’s customer agreements are
generally negotiable on a monthly basis.

We monitor global trends, including demographic and political and economic trends, as well as market
developments to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs. We aim to design our chemical formulations to ensure
they not only meet the requirements of our customers but also those of the end users of our customers’ products.
Our technical services teams work with our customers to ensure we provide the right formulation for their needs.

Furthermore, the technical and service attributes of our speciality chemicals products helps mitigate the chance
that our end customers may substitute our products for those produced by our competitors. The importance of
R&D to our products means that our customers may face high costs of substitution of our products. The underlying

167


-----

investment costs for setting up manufacturing facilities and developing the technical know-how limits new
entrants in the market from being able to compete with our established business.

**_High cash conversion underpinned by low capital expenditure_**

We have a track record of profitable growth and free cash flow generation. Our product portfolio has evolved to
include more differentiated and speciality products that attract higher margins with higher barriers to substitution.
Our “Project Excellence” approach to operational excellence as well as improvements in our procurement strategy
have also helped drive higher volumes of products with higher margins. As described above, we generally have
the ability to pass through movements in the price of raw materials, with a one-month time lag, to our customers,
which enables us to maintain stable unit margins above raw material prices. We maintain fixed cost discipline by
reducing costs through finding efficiencies in existing plants.

We have low levels of maintenance capital expenditure, at approximately £30 million to £35 million per annum,
and our discretionary growth capital expenditure is flexible. We have a well-invested asset base and expect our
expansionary capital expenditure requirements to decrease over the course of the next two to three years as we
complete our ongoing major investment programs, which we expect will further support future cash flow. We
manage our working capital requirements to maintain broadly stable net working capital as a percentage of sales,
at approximately 10%.

**_Well established conservative capital policy including disciplined approach to acquisitions_**

We aim to maintain a conservative and sustainable capital management strategy with clear policies with respect
to our balance sheet leverage, and investments and shareholder returns in order to maintain an efficient and flexible
capital structure over a longer term. We intend to maintain leverage on an ongoing basis of approximately one to
two times our EBITDA, which we view as sustainable. We take a disciplined approach to investment opportunities
including mergers and acquisitions and growth capital expenditure. See “Summary—Our Strategy—Business
_Growth Through Acquisitions.”_

As a public company, we are also aware of our shareholder returns, and have historically maintained a dividend
policy of an ordinary dividend covered 2.5 times by underlying earnings per share. However, as a consequence of
the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to freeze the final dividend payment for the year ended 2019 in the amount
of approximately £30 million.

**_Experienced management team with impressive track record_**

We benefit from a strong and experienced senior management team with significant experience in the chemicals
industry. We have made significant achievements since the appointment of our chief executive officer Calum
MacLean and chief financial officer Steve Bennett in 2015, including EBITDA growth with a CAGR of 9% from
the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2019 and strong cash flow performance. Mr.
MacLean and Mr. Bennett joined Synthomer from INEOS, where they both held leadership positions and
delivered on high profile cost reduction initiatives and successful acquisitions. Mr. MacLean and Mr. Bennett
have driven material improvement in our SHE performance and operational management as well as improvements
in our supply chain. Under Mr. MacLean and Mr. Bennett’s leadership, we undertook the largest capital
investment program in our history to maintain, upgrade and debottleneck our current asset base and respond to
market demand for our products. Our management team also has an excellent track record of integrating acquired
businesses and extracting synergies, as reflected by the successful integration of PAC. We are investing further in
our management team through our “Manufacturing Excellence” project, improvements in our commercial, human
resources and IT functions as well as expanding our procurement team to improve security of supply and cost
effectiveness of our supply chain. Following the Acquisition, we retained Mr. Marshall Moore to serve as our
Chief Technology Officer. Mr. Moore has extensive experience in a range of leadership roles at OMNOVA and
GE Plastics.

**Our Strategy**

Our growth strategy is driven by global megatrends and we are focused on driving sustainable growth through
business efficiency, R&D and capital investment projects. Our management team has a clear strategy for growth

168


-----

through acquisitions and has historically been successful in executing M&A transactions. We continue to assess
both bolt-on and transformational opportunities while continuing to grow the business organically.

Our strategy is composed of the following key pillars:

**_Utilize research and development and technical expertise to exploit new markets_**

We monitor global trends, including demographic, political and economic trends, as well as market developments
to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs and deliver improved products with improved margin and product
differentiation.

We seek to anticipate market trends and customer requirements to deliver improved products in growth markets
which offer improved margins and product differentiation. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 22% of
Synthomer’s sales volumes derived from products that were launched in the previous five years. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer launched 16 new products across multiple application areas and received further
market approval and commercialization of the patented SyNovus® next generation Nitrile latex product.

We view R&D and customer-focused innovation as a critical part of our business strategy. In 2018, the Board
approved an investment in a new state-of-the-art innovation center in Malaysia to add capacity and capability to
enhance our innovation in a lower cost and high-growth region of our network.

**_Drive efficiency and excellence through operations_**

We are focused on continuous improvement across our operations to advance production efficiency, sales
effectiveness and functional excellence while remaining committed to our sustainability standards.

To achieve these aims, we seek to identify good practice in all areas of the business and ensure that relevant
learnings are disseminated across the business.

In 2018, we completed the roll out of our global customer relationship management system and made progress in
strategic procurement initiatives, securing additional tankage to enhance our supply chain resilience, mitigate risk
and further benefit from the procurement of raw materials.

In 2019, we saw the benefit of our strategic procurement initiatives as we built supply chain resilience across our
network. These initiatives allowed us to manage the impact of low water levels in the Rhein in Central Europe
without disruption, manage the introduction of our new 90 kilotonne Nitrile facility in Pasir Gudang and benefit
from added flexibility in our procurement processes through more attractive purchasing contracts. For a limited
number of strategic raw materials, storage tankage was secured in order to provide procurement flexibility on
purchased quantities and maximize the number of suppliers who can be utilized. Over the last several years, our
sustainability committee has worked hard to improve our ESG credentials while remaining committed to driving
efficiency. As a result, we are a world leading supplier of sustainable water-based polymers where we have been
able to decrease the use of VOC containing based products. We have also become a global innovator in driving
the use of water-based technology, with 22% of Synthomer’s sales volume in 2019 coming from products that are
less than five years old.

**_Maximize asset utilization_**

We aim to drive profitability through maximizing the utilization of our assets. To achieve this, we focus on
identifying the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. In 2018, we identified and
eliminated a bottleneck in our site in Marl (Germany) to increase the production of high solids SBR for foam latex
applications. We also completed the disposal of the Leuna site in Germany and commenced restructuring of the
Ribécourt (France), Kluang (Malaysia) and Sokolov (Czech Republic) sites as part of the development of our
manufacturing network.

**_Investment in capacity_**

As part of our focus on organic growth, we seek to add capacity in growth markets where investment opportunities
meet our stringent capital management policies. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the expansion of our
90 kilotonne Nitrile latex capacity plant at Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) on time and on budget. In 2019 we added

169


-----

new capacity in our Functional Solutions business by increasing capacity in our Worms (Germany) and Roebuck
(USA) dispersions facilities. We also completed capacity and capability expansions at our foam SBR plant in
Marl (Germany) and powder coatings in Sant’Albano (Italy).

**_Business growth through acquisitions_**

Our strategic plan involves opportunistic M&A to grow the business. We are highly active in targeting and
reviewing speciality chemicals acquisition opportunities, through both bolt-on acquisitions and more
transformational step-change strategic transactions in adjacent chemistries and geographies, such as the recently
completed Acquisition. Our management is targeting the completion of potentially one or more bolt-on
transactions every year, which we believe will complement and strengthen our existing businesses in a relatively
low-risk and high-return manner. We may also make acquisitions to further diversify our product range such as
our acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf, which is primarily focused on the packaging paper end market. Our
acquisition strategy focuses on targets with a strong technical support function, R&D capabilities, strong market
positions and well-invested, advanced technology production assets, as well as robust speciality unit EBITDA
margins.

Our portfolio is well-positioned to grow through M&A, given our resilient cost base, growth pipeline, and our
experience integrating bolt-on acquisitions. Our M&A activity is supported by our strong balance sheet and further
equity as required. In the last four years, we made three speciality chemical company acquisitions, all bolt-on
acquisitions, complementing our existing businesses. These included the acquisitions of BASF Pischelsdorf in
January 2018, Speciality Additives in March 2017 and PAC in June 2016. The acquisition of PAC, which is fully
integrated in our business, enhanced our dispersions capabilities and we delivered $12 million in run-rate synergy
cost savings by the end of 2018, as well as an additional $2 million in 2019. Integration of acquired assets is
critical to our business and is an important focus for our management as we execute our inorganic growth strategy.
On July 3, 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire the highly complementary
OMNOVA Solutions Inc. We closed the Acquisition on April 1, 2020. This acquisition extends our geographic
reach, expands the global platform and allows further differentiation of the business. As a result of the Acquisition,
we expect recurring run rate pre-tax cost synergies of $29.6 million per annum by the end of the third year
following completion.

From time to time, we also consider opportunistic investments in larger speciality chemicals companies. However,
the delivery of any such potential acquisitions would be subject to the acquisitions being aligned with our business
strategy and enhancing the overall value of our business. During the periods under review presented in this
Offering Memorandum, management has actively pursued acquisitions in the market and, in addition to those
acquisitions that have been completed, has considered several potential acquisitions which it has decided not to
pursue as a result of valuation differences and due diligence findings.

**SYNTHOMER**

**Synthomer’s History And Development**

Synthomer’s history can be traced back to 1863 to the founding to George Yule & Co., the predecessor of the
Group, in London. On October 14, 1971 Yule Catto & Co. Limited (“Yule Catto”) was listed on the London
Stock Exchange.

By 1980, Yule Catto was engaged in the operation of marinas, rubber and oil palm plantations, and had
investments in oil exploration. In that year, it acquired Revertex Chemicals Limited, an international group
engaged in the processing of natural rubber latex and the manufacture of synthetic rubber lattices, resins and
emulsions. In 1981, Yule Catto & Co. Limited changed its name to Yule Catto & Co. plc.

In 1998, Yule Catto acquired Holliday Chemical Holdings PLC, a manufacturer of a wide range of chemicals,
including active pharmaceutical chemicals, pigments, dyes and metal salt compounds. From 2006 to 2008, Yule
Catto divested a range of businesses to become a focused supplier of water-based polymers. In 2011, Yule Catto
acquired PolymerLatex, headquartered in Marl, Germany, with operations in Europe and Asia, a manufacturer of
speciality polymers including SBR and NBR lattices and a range of acrylic dispersions.

In 2012, Yule Catto & Co. plc changed its name to Synthomer plc. In 2016, Synthomer completed the acquisition
of PAC and sold Revertex South Africa (Pty.) Limited. In 2017, Synthomer acquired 100% of the issued share
capital of Speciality Additives, a niche performance additives business serving the decorative and industrial

170


-----

coatings industries while in 2018 it acquired BASF Pischelsdorf. On April 1, 2020, Synthomer acquired
OMNOVA.

**Synthomer’s Products**

Synthomer is a leading global producer of water-based polymers, primarily producing water-based polymers
through a emulsion polymerization process, which removes the requirement for large amounts of organic solvents
during production and use. These polymers are made up of different chemical building blocks (monomers) that
lead to the different chemistry platforms in the Group’s portfolio. The resultant water-based systems have very
low levels of volatile organic compounds, some of which can have harmful effects from a health and wider
environmental impact.

The Group believes that it offers the widest range of chemistry platforms available compared to its peer group and
its product development processes enables it to deliver the best value solutions to customers across the various
types of chemicals it offers. Synthomer’s innovation model leverages its expertise across its core chemistries and
applications to effectively deploy its core know-how in the most efficient way. For example, chemistry solutions
initially focused on improving the coating performance of dispersion-based paints have been modified to give
enhanced performance in NBR glove applications.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer produced products in the following four categories as classified
by type of chemistry—Nitrile Butadiene Rubber, or NBR; Styrene Butadiene Rubber, or SBR; Dispersions; and
polymers and speciality chemicals that are used in high performance markets that are classified as “Industrial
Specialities.”

**_Performance Elastomers_**

_Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (“NBR”)_

Globally, Synthomer is the second-largest producer of NBR latex by volume. NBR latex polymers are waterbased synthetic polymers that are manufactured by an emulsion polymerization process. The products have
excellent barrier and tear-resistance properties and are resistant to oils and chemicals. As NBR products do not
contain the proteins which occur in natural rubber, they can also offer a hypoallergenic alternative to natural
rubber.

Synthomer has made significant R&D investment in NBR products in recent years which has driven its
development of market-leading products. Synthomer’s NBR products serve a fast-growing market which has
experienced a growth rate of approximately 8% to 10% per annum from 2010 to 2019. In order to support this
expected growth, Synthomer intends to expand its manufacturing capacity for NBR products. The Group produces
NBR primarily for the health and protection end markets and for use in medical gloves and medical devices.
Synthomer’s position as a supplier of NBR products is further strengthened by its geographic proximity to major
glove producers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 39.6% of Synthomer’s Performance Elastomers volume
came from health and protection NBR applications.

Synthomer focuses on NBR production primarily in Southeast Asia. In Europe, NBR is produced at Synthomer’s
manufacturing facility in Italy.

Synthomer has invested £45 million in the continuing expansion of NBR production capacity at its Pasir Gudang
manufacturing site in Malaysia adding 90,000 tonnes per year at the end of 2018. Synthomer intends to add further
capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year at the manufacturing site during the second half of 2021. The Pasir Gudang
facility is the largest manufacturer in Malaysia, and is one of the largest and most competitive assets in the
industry.

In 2017, Synthomer launched SyNovus, a patented next generation Nitrile latex innovation used in medical gloves,
which addresses customers’ key requirements with respect to manufacturing efficiency, odor, color and chemical
resistance. Synthomer continues to focus on innovation and operational efficiencies in Malaysia, as well as
commercialization of SyNovus.

_Styrene Butadiene Rubber (“SBR”)_

Synthomer is the leading producer of SBR in Europe by volume. SBR latex polymers are water-based synthetic
polymers that are manufactured by a process called emulsion polymerization. The products have excellent

171


-----

properties as binders in multiple industrial end uses. Synthomer primarily produces SBR for coated paper and
packaging, carpet backing and foam markets for use in mattresses, pillows and shoes.

The Group believes that it offers market-leading manufacturing technology which it is able to leverage across its
manufacturing network for SBR products. Synthomer’s manufacturing centers are closely integrated with its key
raw material suppliers for SBR products to ensure security of its raw material supply. In turn, Synthomer’s
manufacturing centers are also typically located close to its core customer base in order to support its customers’
logistical requirements.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer sold approximately 510 kilotonnes of SBR products. In the
near-to-medium term, Synthomer expects growth in the foam, packaging, and cardboard end markets, with a slight
decline in the graphic paper market as customers move to electronic media. Synthomer is also undertaking
business development in high value applications of SBR, including oil fields and batteries.

Synthomer produces SBR at its manufacturing facilities in Germany, Italy, Finland, the U.K., Malaysia, the
Netherlands and Egypt. In 2018, Synthomer acquired BASF Pischelsdorf, an SBR business, which has enhanced
its business and production network in paper and packaging applications as well as providing increased access to
attractive new opportunities across Europe. Synthomer is focused on debottlenecking its manufacturing facilities
and rationalizing its assets, in order to enhance its production and utilization capacities and achieve lower
manufacturing costs. It is expected that the Pischelsdorf site acquired from BASF will also help Synthomer
consolidate its market position in Europe. Synthomer is continually evaluating and developing its product
offerings in order to meet customer needs, such as the recently introduced range of SBR lattices for flexible
cement, which were developed in response to discussions with construction customers and industry regulators.

**_Functional Solutions_**

Synthomer is the number one producer of acrylic and vinylic dispersions in Europe and the Middle East by revenue
and volume. The Group produces an extensive range of dispersions, manufactured by both emulsion and solution
polymerization where the primary building blocks are either vinyl acetate or acrylate monomers (e.g., butyl
acrylate). These products are used as binders to allow the formulation of environmentally compliant materials in
diverse end markets such as construction, coatings, adhesives and textiles. Synthomer’s dispersion polymers are
used for a broad range of applications such as cement modification, primers, flooring adhesives, emulsions and
specialist paints. The Group believes that its position as a leading producer of water-based dispersions is supported
by regulatory drivers promoting environmentally-friendly products, since Synthomer’s water-based products
remove the requirement to use harmful organic solvents in manufacture and use, thus reducing environmental
burden and potential health impacts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer sold 487.4 kilotonnes of
dispersions products and derived 41.8% of its total revenues from sales of dispersions products.

Synthomer produces dispersions at its manufacturing facilities in the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain, France,
the U.K., the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Saudi Arabia. For the year ended December 31,
2019, the Group generated £612.8 million from sales of dispersions products. In June 2016, Synthomer acquired
PAC, which gave it access to acrylic platforms in the pressure sensitive adhesives (“PSA”) market. PSA acrylics
are used in the fast-growing food packaging and bottle labelling end markets and in packaging, where water-based
PSA acrylics are increasingly replacing water-borne and natural latex. PSA technology enables transparent
labelling film to be placed on windows and bottles allowing labels to applied using pressure only and without the
use of adhesives. In addition, Synthomer has added new capacity in its made-to-order acrylic lines at its
manufacturing site in Worms (Germany) as well as adding a new acrylic reactor line at the Roebuck (U.S.)
manufacturing site to secure access to the North American performance and construction adhesives markets.

**_Industrial Specialities (Including Acrylates)_**

Synthomer produces polymers and speciality chemicals that are used in high performance markets such as the
automotive sector, PVC manufacturing, construction and polymer manufacturing. Synthomer has a highly
diversified technology base for speciality products which enables it to serve a range of high performance
applications segments. Synthomer is a leading supplier of suspending agents used in the production of PVC with
Alcotex polyvinyl alcohols, sealant and adhesive polymers through Lithene liquid polybutadienes and
thermosetting resins for powder coatings. Other applications include catalysts and flame retardants and a range of
high performance coating additives.

172


-----

Specialities are used as key formulating components in certain of the Group’s core markets which allows it to
cross-sell its speciality products to existing customers. For example, core products from Synthomer’s Speciality
Additives business are used to enhance the performance of decorative and industrial paints, which is one of the
core end markets served by Synthomer’s dispersions business. Synthomer’s long-standing customer relationships
enable it to develop bespoke solutions for its customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer sold 129.2 kilotonnes of specialities products and derived
15.3% of its total revenues from sales of specialities products (including 61.9 kilotonnes of Acrylates). The Group
holds leading positions in select niche specialities markets globally. Demand for eco-friendly products, adoption
of sustainable manufacturing practices by manufacturers, and emissions regulations provide Synthomer’s
specialities businesses with opportunities for growth. For example, the Group’s powder coatings business, which
manufactures solvent-free products, is well-suited to grow due to demand from environmentally conscious
customers.

Synthomer produces speciality polymers at its manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Italy, Belgium and the Czech
Republic. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer generated £222.6 million from sales of speciality
products (including £70.9 from sales of Acrylates). In March 2017, Synthomer acquired Speciality Additives
(Perstorp Oxo Belgium AB), which produces niche performance additives for decorative and industrial coatings
industries, such as paint additives that enhance weather resistance of products.

**Product Development**

Synthomer’s product development lifecycle begins with its individual business units, which lead a market-driven
process to identify new product development opportunities based on megatrends, segment drivers and individual
customer input. The ideas are managed through Synthomer’s stage-gate processes and are formally approved by
a steering team consisting of senior directors from the commercial and R&D functions. New proposals are
assessed based on their strategic fit, value creation potential, capability to deliver and resource requirements. The
Group’s innovation portfolio is prioritized based on estimated future profitability, perceived market needs, volume
potential and capacity availability. Synthomer measures its overall innovation results in three ways: output of
process (total net sales value of products launched in the prior five years); the aggregate expected total value from
development projects currently in the pipeline in the fifth year after their expected launch in the market; and the
number and approved value of new projects.

173


-----

**_Research and Development_**

R&D plays a key role in Synthomer’s business and is closely linked to its production process development.
Synthomer’s innovative developments help drive its revenue growth, with sales of new products that were
launched in the preceding five years constituting more than 20% of total sales volume in each of the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019. A dedicated R&D team, which works closely with the Group’s business
development directors, is in place to drive innovation in new market areas, which has led to new products and
sales into, for example, battery systems and oil field chemicals that enhance the properties of cement used in oil
wells. Additionally Synthomer is establishing a new intellectual property group, headed by an experienced patent
attorney, to support group-wide activities related to protection and exploitation of company know-how.

Synthomer’s R&D function is focused on improving its margin and enhancing its product differentiation. The
R&D strategy centers on the evolution of existing products to new applications and providing tailored solutions
to its customers. Synthomer’s expertise in the applications of its products helps add further value to its customers’
use of those products. Synthomer is also able to leverage its core applications and technology across multiple
platforms. For example, it has patented a SBR platform that eliminates a generation of harmful by-products in
use, which is being commercialized across a range of different core application areas.

Synthomer invested in extensive R&D in 2019, with £16.6 million in R&D expenditures driving continued
innovation across its product lines. R&D expenditure and scope has increased as the company has grown
organically and inorganically in recent years. In 2017, Synthomer established its new oil field testing laboratory
and launched a new range of oil field additive chemicals that enable cement used in oil drilling wells to withstand
extreme temperatures. This range is being further developed with flow viscosity modifiers to make a
complimentary range of additives to serve this broad market.

Synthomer launched 16 new products in the year ended December 31, 2019, and since 2016, has file 11 patents.
In 2018, Synthomer launched its Litex QuickShield™ technology, which won the award for “Best Innovation in
Textile Chemistry” at the renowned Future Textile Awards 2018. In 2017, Synthomer launched its latest patented
invention, SyNovus, a new type of synthetic Nitrile latex used in the production of gloves used in the medical
sector. Designed as a low energy Nitrile with reduced maturation requirements, resulting in lower operating costs
and improved efficiency, SyNovus offers superior tensile strength and higher levels of durability and chemical
resistance as compared to existing products available in the market. SyNovus is also accelerator-free, which
improves the benefit and reduces any risk in use for glove wearers. The new product launch of SyNovus
represented a further milestone for Synthomer’s innovation team in Malaysia, which reduced the development
time from inception to commercialization, including patenting the proprietary technology, to just 18 months. The
shortened innovation process represents a reduction in development time of almost 50% compared to previous
new product developments.

Synthomer works in partnership with its customers, using skilled technical services and R&D teams to develop
products that support its customers’ goals. Synthomer’s manufacturing facilities are located in close geographic
proximity to its customers to enable continuous communication with and feedback from customers, which is then
incorporated into Synthomer’s product development. In 2019, Synthomer launched a new water-based pressure
sensitive adhesive system that can be used as an alternative to conventional solvent based systems, while
maintaining performance levels. Close collaboration with customers has included working directly at customer
sites during their production trials to support the product implementation. Synthomer also has 14 active university
collaborations to drive R&D, including with the University of Warwick, University of Surrey, University of
Manchester and the University of Technology, Malaysia. These collaborations are focused on research activities
to underpin Synthomer’s commercial development activities to evaluate, for example, new polymer systems, new
process technologies and understanding the fundamental chemistry during application. The collaborations also
give Synthomer access to world-leading experts and facilities, facilitate recruitment of new talent into the
organization, and supports its wider objective to support education in the chemical sciences.

Synthomer maintains four R&D centers including a new state-of-the-art U.K. Innovation Centre, as well as R&D
centers in Malaysia, Germany, and the U.S. In addition to Synthomer’s existing R&D centers, an expanded Asian
innovation center in Johor Bahru is expected to open in 2020.

**_Environmental and Social_**

Synthomer is committed to ESG principles, and since 2018 has continued to make progress within its six pillar
framework, which is focused on its strategy, governance and compliance, people, sustainable value chain, health
and safety and environment. In 2019, Synthomer made significant progress towards its goal of developing strong
ESG credentials. For example, Synthomer launched a new interactive global Code of Conduct which has been
made available to employees in 13 languages while also launching new employee engagement initiatives.
Diversity is an important part of Synthomer’s business, and it is committed to at least one third female Board
membership by the end of the year 2020. In addition, Synthomer has made sustainability a priority and it is
committed to quantifying, improving and communicating the sustainability of all its activities through GRI
reporting. Moreover, Synthomer is proud to record no reportable environmental incidents for the year 2019.
Synthomer has also established an independent whistleblower hotline, providing employees with the opportunity
to report any concerns anonymously.

Synthomer has achieved several corporate ratings, including its silver rating from EcoVadis, a BBB rating from
MSCI and a ‘medium risk’ designation from Sustainalytics, placing Synthomer in the top quartile in the chemical
industry on that measure. Synthomer has further expanded upon its Carbon Disclosure Program (“CDP”) rating,
improving from a D in 2018 to a B- as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Supply Chain Management_**

Synthomer’s expenditure on raw materials constituted approximately 91% of its variable costs for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Synthomer utilizes a diversified supplier base of major blue-chip chemical companies—its
ten largest suppliers accounted for 58% of the Group’s raw material expenditure for the year ended December 31,
2019, with no single supplier accounting for more than 10% of the Group’s spend on raw materials. Synthomer’s
two largest suppliers accounted for 9% and 9%, respectively, of its raw material expenditure for the year ended
December 31, 2019. No other supplier accounted for more than 8% of its total expenditure on raw materials for
the year ended December 31, 2019. The supplier base has widened in recent years, as Synthomer’s expanded
procurement team has improved security of supply and cost-effectiveness by developing links with a wider
number of raw material suppliers.

Synthomer’s top ten raw materials by expense collectively accounted for 58% of its raw material expenditure for
the year ended December 31, 2019. Synthomer’s top five raw materials by expense are styrene, butadiene, butyl
acrylate, propylene and vinyl acetate monomer, which accounted for 15%, 12%, 6%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of
its expenditure on raw materials for the year ended December 31, 2019. Prices of a majority of Synthomer’s raw
materials by cost are at least partially dependent on crude oil prices. Synthomer’s acquisitions of PAC, Speciality
Additives and BASF Pischelsdorf have not materially changed its primary raw material requirements.

Between 2017 and 2019 Synthomer undertook a growth capital investment program to focus on growth markets
where it was experiencing increased demand for its products. Synthomer’s investments are focused on both
capacity enhancement and expansion of its product suite. In the fourth quarter of 2018 Synthomer completed a
£45 million investment of its Pasir Gudang (Malaysia) plant to increase capacity by 90 kilotonnes for its leading
edge NBR products for medical glove use. With high growth rates in this market, Synthomer started to run at full
capacity by the end of 2019. In 2019, two speciality acrylic dispersion plant expansions were commissioned
successfully. Synthomer further invested £30 million in its production facility in Worms, Germany, which has
expanded production capacity by 36,000 tonnes. The Worms facility is the largest plant in Europe for complex
speciality acrylics. Synthomer has invested $16 million in its plant in Roebuck, U.S., adding a new acrylic reactor
line with 12,000 tonnes of capacity.

Synthomer’s quality control (“QC”) procedures and laboratories ensure that it manufactures and stores finished
products in a manner that assures quality. As part of Synthomer’s “Manufacturing Excellence” approach, each of
its operational sites has a QC department independent of production and a quality assurance manager. For every
product and every delivery, a representative sample is tested according to an inspection plan. Certificates of
analysis are provided for every delivery.

Synthomer’s specialist logistics teams works on ensuring safe and timely delivery of its products in more than
100 countries. Teams coordinate logistics from product planning through delivery, including order intake and
preparation, loadings and pre-loading preparations at plants, warehouses and carriers, coordination of
transportation, ongoing monitoring of orders and deliveries, and management of delivery-related complaints.

In order to deliver Synthomer’s long-term inorganic growth agenda and to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness and
compliance of its organization, Synthomer commenced a business transformation ‘Pathway’ program. The
program is designed to deliver a consistent set of global business processes across a unified target operating model,
transforming its technology architecture into a single set of proven integrated systems and building additional
efficiency and effectiveness globally. The roll out of the program is planned to start in 2021.

**Synthomer’s Customers And End Markets**

**_Customers_**

Synthomer has a diversified blue-chip customer base with long-term established relationships. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, Synthomer had approximately 4,300 customers worldwide with an average customer
relationship length over 12 years. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Synthomer’s largest customer
represented approximately 2% of total revenues while revenues from Synthomer’s twenty largest customers
represented 17% of total revenues. On a combined basis for the same period, our largest customer contributed to
1.5% of our total sales and our largest twenty customers contributed approximately 20% of our total sales. Across
Synthomer’s global operating segments, its products are typically integral components of its customers’ end
products, resulting in high switching costs for existing customers.

Synthomer monitors global trends, including demographic and political and economic trends, as well as market
developments to anticipate and meet its customers’ needs. Synthomer aims to design its chemical formulations to
ensure they not only meet the requirements of its customers but also those of the end users of its customers’
products. Synthomer’s technical services teams work with customers to ensure that it is providing the right
formulation for their needs.

One example of Synthomer’s product penetration, brand recognition, and integration with customers’ supply
chains is the NBR product line. Synthomer is viewed by its customers in the global glove manufacturing industry
as a trusted long-term partner and the market leading supplier of Nitrile butadiene latex. Synthomer’s broad
product portfolio, innovation, global manufacturing network, technical support and close proximity to customers
supports its leading position. Synthomer has a decades-long history of supplying Nitrile latex to the Malaysian,
Southeast Asian and global glove manufacturing industry.

The majority of customer contracts are structured to enable pass-through of raw material costs, enabling
Synthomer to support stable and sustainable margins. A significant proportion of Synthomer’s customer contracts
typically have no pricing commitment beyond one month, allowing Synthomer to modify pricing in line with raw
material costs. Synthomer’s products are generally priced in accordance with one of two different types of

177


-----

agreements: (i) formulaic agreements with price-indexed clauses and/or ICIS-related pricing, which provide for
a high degree of direct pass through of any changes in raw material prices to customers; and (ii) agreements
renegotiated on a regular (usually monthly) basis, in which Synthomer’s ability to retain the benefits of declines
in raw material prices or to pass through increases in raw material prices is affected by the supply and demand
balance of the particular product as well as its ability to apply pricing and margin enhancement tools according to
customer relationships and the expectations customers have in respect of these costs. Accordingly, substantially
all of Synthomer’s customer agreements have no pricing commitment beyond one month, with approximately one
third of its customer agreements being formulaic with the remainder being generally negotiable on a monthly
basis. Thus, Synthomer is generally able to maintain its unit margins at even when prices for raw materials
experience sudden or sharp increases. For example, Synthomer was able to maintain its unit margins at a broadly
stable rate even when the prices for butadiene, Synthomer’s most significant raw material by expenditure, which
is used in the production of both NBR and SBR, experienced a sharp increase towards the end of 2016 and the
beginning of 2017. This increase in price of butadiene was primarily driven by stronger global demand,
particularly from China, combined with low inventories, including as a result of climate events and outages at
butadiene plants in Asia.

**_End Markets_**

The products Synthomer offers have applications in a range of end markets. Construction and coating is our largest
end market, with sales to the construction and coating end market constituting 25% of total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2019. Sales to the specialities, health and protection, textiles and adhesives, paper, and carpet
and foam end markets constituted 15%, 23%, 15%, 11% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2019.

**Safety, Health and Environment**

**_Overview_**

Synthomer’s facilities and operations are subject to extensive and continuously evolving environmental, health,
and safety laws and regulations. These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage,
handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges, air
emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, human health and safety, process safety and risk
management and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Synthomer has invested, and will continue to invest, financial
and technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with environmental requirements.

Management of the Group believes that its operations are currently in material compliance with all SHE laws,
regulations and permits. Synthomer actively addresses compliance issues in connection with its operations and
properties and,management believes that systems are in place to ensure that environmental costs and liabilities
will not have a material adverse impact on its business.

**_Occupational Safety Performance_**

The main lagging indicator that Synthomer uses to measure SHE injury performance is the recordable injury rate
for accidents involving more than first aid treatment. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the Group saw
an improvement in SHE injury performance, with the number of recordable injuries reducing from 16 to 13, with
a frequency rate of 0.2 per 100,000 hours worked. This amounted to a 13% improvement over the year ended
December 31, 2018 and an 82% improvement since the year ended December 31, 2011. Synthomer’s reportable
lost time accident rate improved in 2017 to give Synthomer its best performance, with six over-three-day lost time
accidents during the year down from 11 the previous year, at frequency rate of 0.09 per 100,000 hours worked.
There were no reported cases of disease attributed to occupational factors in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Process Safety Performance_

Since 2015, Synthomer has recorded, rated and tracked process safety events (“PSE”) using a 4 tier scoring system
where tier 1 and 2 incidents (tier 1 being more severe) meet the definition for a “Reportable PSE” from the
International Council of Chemical Association. Performance in this area during the year ended December 31,
2019 improved to 0.11, delivering Synthomer its best performance.

178


-----

There were 7 reportable PSEs for the year ended December 31, 2019, equivalent to a rate of 0.11 per 100,000
hours, a 30% improvement from 2018 and a 58% improvement from 2015. None of the reported incidents resulted
in serious injury. This increase was partly linked to a wider definition of PSE and seven of the events occurred at
sites acquired in 2016 and 2017. Those sites were adopting Synthomer’s more stringent standards and there is an
increased focus on support for all acquired sites to ensure that their process safety management controls and layers
of protection are robust.

_Key SHE Programs and Actions_

SHE management practices and systems are embedded throughout the Group with the aim of continuously
improving SHE performance.

Synthomer’s safety, health and environment management system standards and policies include identification and
sharing of best practice; refreshing of Group SHE procedures linked to key areas of management of change and
permit to work. Objectives for 2020 include refreshing further Group SHE procedures; completion of revised
permit to work guidance; and development of self-assessment questionnaires to assist internal audit process.

Synthomer’s accident and incident management system includes trend analysis undertaken to identify common
themes as regarding incidents and system failings—loss of containment issues identified and as a result new key
performance indicators introduced. Incident root causes identified for further focus included poor risk assessment,
human factors and asset integrity issues. Objectives for 2020 include effective use of lessons learnt and site review
of high potential incidents to help prioritize where to focus resource to improve performance

Synthomer’s SHE training, communication and support includes the continued roll-out of first line management
competence assurance program; ongoing process safety training across the Group; and Global SHE Managers’
and Site Managers’ Workshops focusing on sharing, learning and SHE leadership. Objectives for 2020 include
development of modular in-house process safety training tailored to Synthomer’s technologies and processes;
increased level of support versus audit to achieve targeted improvements in performance based on findings from
last audit cycle; and working with sites to develop a program of standardized SHE routines to back up all other
major SHE initiatives.

The Process Hazard Assessment (“PHA”) revalidation process is facilitated by Synthomer’s SHE team on several
sites to assure the Executive Committee that major accident hazards are being appropriately managed and
controlled. Objectives for 2020 include continuation of the PHA revalidation process across lower risk profile
sites and key performance indicator tracking of significant actions from 2019.

**Regulatory Matters and Developments**

REACH and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”) regulate chemical products within
the EU by imposing on all affected industries the responsibility for ensuring and demonstrating the safe
manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. The REACH Regulation requires the registration of all chemicals
manufactured and imported into the EU (either alone, in mixtures or in articles) with the European Chemicals
Agency (“ECHA”). The regulation requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard
assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses.
Most uses of high hazard substances, such as carcinogens, will require authorization by the ECHA. REACH
requires extensive toxicological data, documentation and risk assessments for many of Synthomer’s chemical
products and raw materials. Synthomer has taken steps to ensure that REACH become an integral part of its
ongoing business throughout pre-registration, the three transitional phase-in registration deadlines, and beyond,
and is committed to its REACH activities falling fully in line with the applicable guidelines. The vast majority of
Synthomer’s products fall within the Polymer Exemption and, aside from ensuring that the individual substances
contained in the mixture are registered in their own right for the required use, most of Synthomer’s products
therefore require little further assessment to comply with the current REACH legislation. Synthomer does
however review its full product portfolio to identify products that do not meet the Polymer Exemption criteria so
that appropriate action can be taken for those materials. Fewer than 20 products (approximately 1% of the
portfolio) made in Europe fall outside of the Polymer Exemption criteria. A small number (approximately 20) of
Synthomer’s compound products sold in Europe are classified as Category 2 reprotoxins, i.e., products that may
interfere with human reproduction, due to a proprietary additive used in the system. Synthomer works closely

179


-----

with its customers to share appropriate safety and handling information on all of these products to ensure their
safe use.

As a corollary to the REACH Regulation, the EU has also adopted the CLP to harmonize the EU’s system of
classifying, labelling and packaging chemical substances with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System.
The regulation is expected to standardize communication of hazard information of chemicals and to promote
regulatory efficiency. It introduces new classification criteria, hazard symbols and labelling phrases, while taking
account of elements that are part of the current EU legislation. The vast majority of Synthomer products fall under
the definition of mixtures and, as such, all of Synthomer’s actions were completed by the appropriate deadlines.
Synthomer is committed to achieving full compliance with the CLP requirements in close cooperation with its
suppliers and customers, including the obligation to report certain substances to the Classification and Labelling
Inventory.

**Intellectual Property**

Synthomer has comprehensive current patent coverage for both products and processes. Synthomer currently has
a significant number of patents and pending patent applications, of which the majority are related to products and
their application with some additional patents covering process technology. Synthomer’s patent portfolio includes
patent families in different jurisdictions. Synthomer also owns trademarks in all of the jurisdictions where it
believes such registration is necessary, and owns web domains matching its trademark and company profile.
Synthomer’s policy is to protect all of its significant technologies by either seeking patent protection or keeping
the know-how as trade secret. Where needed, Synthomer would defend and enforce its intellectual property rights.
Synthomer has over 50 active patent families of which 11 filings were made in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Synthomer also owns more than 539 trademarks distributed over 42 trademark families. In order to protect
confidential technical information which is not subject to patent protection, Synthomer relies on trade secret law
and frequently enters into confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and partners.

In addition to Synthomer’s own patents, patent applications, proprietary trade secrets and know-how, Synthomer
is party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing it to use trade secrets, know-how and
related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities.

While Synthomer’s management believes that its intellectual property provides competitive advantages, as a result
of the breadth and nature of its intellectual property rights and business, it does not believe that any single
intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which it intends to maintain the applicable
registrations) is material to its current business. Moreover, it is not believed that the termination of intellectual
property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially
adversely affect Synthomer’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Synthomer is not aware of any threatened, proposed or actual proceedings that have or will be brought against it
for infringement of third-party rights or any infringement of Synthomer’s rights by third parties that if successfully
prosecuted would have a material and adverse effect upon its business.

**Employees**

The following table details the average number of full time equivalent for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2018 and 2019:

**Year Ended December 31,** **2017** **2018** **2019**
Average number of full time employees ................................................. 2,879 2,918 2,900

Over the years, Synthomer has enjoyed a positive working relationship with its labor force and unions, and
Synthomer is committed to maintaining these relationships going forward. Nearly half of Synthomer’s nonmanagement employees are covered by some form of collective bargaining arrangement at site or national level
or a works council agreement. In such plants, Synthomer works with trade unions in line with that country’s laws
and regulations.

180


-----

**Insurance**

Synthomer’s management believes that Synthomer’s current insurance coverage is appropriate for its business, in
respect of the amount and applicable excesses and deductibles, considering its business location as well as the
size and scope of its business activities.

**Legal and Regulatory Proceedings**

From time to time, Synthomer is involved in lawsuits, claims, disputes with customers, suppliers or employees,
as well as investigations, arbitrations and other proceedings (including administrative proceedings), which are
handled in the ordinary course of business.

_Tax Disputes_

Although Synthomer believes that it has followed and intends to follow in the future a prudent approach to its tax
position and its compliance with tax laws and regulations, Synthomer has been and is, from time to time, involved
in tax audits and other proceedings, claims or investigations conducted by national or regional tax authorities. For
example, Synthomer is currently the subject of ongoing tax proceedings in Spain arising out of a tax audit
conducted with respect to the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 and a further audit for the years 2006 to 2008, primarily
in connection with the tax deductibility of certain financial expenses deducted by Synthomer’s Spanish subsidiary.
Following the completion of their tax audit procedures, the relevant Spanish tax authorities rendered a
determination against Synthomer and imposed two tax assessments amounting to €11 million with respect to the
2003-2005 audit, and €2.6 million with respect to the 2006-2008 audit. Synthomer appealed the adverse
determination and the tax assessments to the Regional Tax Court of Catalonia which upheld the adverse
determination and both tax assessments. Following this ruling, Synthomer appealed to the Central Tax Court in
Spain which also rejected its appeal. Synthomer further appealed to the National Audience and its appeal is
currently pending before the National Audience. Synthomer’s maximum exposure under these procedures as of
December 31, 2019 was £13.5 million, including accrued interest payable on the original assessments. The tax
debt payable is currently suspended and Synthomer has in place a guarantee issued by Citibank Europe plc to
cover Synthomer’s liabilities thereunder. In addition, Synthomer is currently the subject of ongoing tax
proceedings in the U.K. arising out of a tax audit conducted with respect to the years 2001 and 2002 for a potential
claim of up to £10.2 million. The HMRC are currently considering their position, and Synthomer expects to hear
from the HMRC in the first half of 2020.

_Styrene Purchasing Investigation_

On June 8, 2018, the European Commission announced that its officials carried out unannounced inspections in
several Member States at the premises of a number of companies active in styrene monomer purchasing, including
Synthomer. The European Commission has concerns that the companies investigated may have violated EU
antitrust rules prohibiting anti-competitive practices concerning the purchase of styrene monomers, including
coordination of purchase prices and purchasing strategies.

Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in investigations into suspected anticompetitive practices. The
maximum possible fine Synthomer may face from the European Commission is capped at 10% of its worldwide
turnover for the financial year preceding the date of the European Commission decision. The fact that the
European Commission carries out such inspections does not in itself mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. There is no deadline for the
European Commission to complete inquiries into potential anticompetitive conduct and therefore there is no
certainty as to when Synthomer may have any further information with respect to this investigation. At this stage,
Synthomer is not able to anticipate the outcome of this investigation and Synthomer is cooperating with the
European Commission on its investigation. Synthomer has in place a code of conduct and compliance training
procedures for its employees in order to ensure its ongoing compliance with antitrust and other regulations. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be subject to antitrust or other regulatory
_investigations.”_

**OMNOVA**

**OMNOVA Group History and Development**

OMNOVA was formed in June 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of GenCorp Inc. On October 1, 1999,
OMNOVA Solutions Inc. was spun-off from GenCorp as an independent, publicly traded corporation.

OMNOVA has made a series of acquisitions in recent years, including New Fluid Solutions in 2015 and Creole
Chemical in 2017.

On September 25, 2018, the OMNOVA Group acquired Resiquímica, a Portugal-based producer of polymers and
resins for coatings and construction applications in Europe, Middle East and Africa, from Socer-Imobiliaria e
Investimentos, S.A. for €21.8 million ($25.8 million), net of acquired cash plus debt assumed of $9.8 million.

On June 28, 2018, OMNOVA announced the closure of its Green Bay, Wisconsin styrene butadiene facility,
moving production to OMNOVA’s Mogadore, Ohio facility as part of its strategic decision to exit the commodity
coated paper sector. The OMNOVA Group completed the sale of the Green Bay facility on May 20, 2019. On
April 1, 2020, OMNOVA was acquired by Synthomer and delisted from the NYSE.

**International Operations**

OMNOVA has global operations, serving more than 90 countries with operations and technology centers in North
America, Europe and Asia.

Net sales from OMNOVA’s operations outside of the United States were $308.0 million for the financial year
ended November 30, 2019, $320.2 million for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and $301.4 million
for the financial year ended November 30, 2017. These net sales represented 41.8% of OMNOVA’s total net sales
for the financial year ended November 30, 2019, 41.6% for the financial year ended November 30, 2018 and
38.5% for the financial year ended November 30, 2017.

**Marketing and Distribution**

OMNOVA primarily sells its products in both the Specialty Solutions and Performance Materials segments
directly to manufacturers through dedicated internal marketing, sales and technical service teams focused on
providing highly responsive customized solutions. Distributors are used to help expand sales coverage
geographically and with newer customers.

In addition, OMNOVA’s Performance Materials segment distributes its products through a direct sales force and
agents to manufacturers of retail store fixtures, cabinets, furniture, seating, health care components and other
products. Many of OMNOVA’s coated fabrics products have strong, recognizable brand names that are promoted
through trade shows, industry periodicals, OMNOVA’s website and other media.

**Seasonal Factors**

OMNOVA historically experiences stronger sales and income in its second, third and fourth quarters, comprised
of the three-month periods ending May 31, August 31 and November 30. OMNOVA’s performance in the first
quarter (December through February) has historically been affected by generally lower levels of customer
manufacturing, construction and refurbishment activities during the holidays and cold weather months.

_Raw Materials_

OMNOVA uses a variety of raw materials, primarily monomers, in the manufacture of its products. Most of these
raw materials have been, and OMNOVA expects will continue to be, generally available from multiple suppliers.
Monomers, which are a major component of OMNOVA’s polymers-based products, include butadiene, styrene,
acrylates, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinyl pyridine, PVC resins, textiles, plasticizers, paper and titanium
dioxide.

OMNOVA generally attempts to respond to raw material cost increases through productivity programs and price
increases to OMNOVA’s customers. Index pricing applies to approximately 25% of OMNOVA’s total net sales.

182


-----

_Intellectual Property_

OMNOVA regards patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to its business,
and OMNOVA relies on them globally to protect OMNOVA’s investments in products and technology.
OMNOVA’s patents expire at various times, but OMNOVA believes that the loss or expiration of any individual

_Employees_

The following table sets out the number of OMNOVA Group employees as at November 30, 2019 and November
30, 2018, by region:

**Number of employees as at November 30,**
**Region** **2018** **2019**
United States ............................................................................................................ 1,005 956
Asia Pacific.............................................................................................................. 711 524
Europe, Middle East and Africa .............................................................................. 261 387

**Total ........................................................................................................................** **1,977** 1,867

As at November 30, 2019, approximately 12% of OMNOVA’s U.S. employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements in the U.S., of which approximately 20 employees are covered by agreements that expire
within the next twelve months. In addition, certain of OMNOVA’s foreign employees are also covered by
collective bargaining agreements.

_Legal Proceedings_

The China Customs office in Shanghai found that OMNOVA had previously used an incorrect customs code in
connection with exports from China in respect of a small product line. As a result, the local Shanghai taxing
authority will seek to recoup certain value added tax (“VAT”) refunds previously received by OMNOVA in
respect of the exported products. As of February 2020, discussions with the local Shanghai taxing authority were
not sufficiently advanced for OMNOVA to reasonably estimate the amount of possible recoupment of historical
VAT refunds plus interest and penalties. Accordingly, no provision related to this matter has been recorded in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of February 29, 2020. Synthomer is working with the tax
authorities to agree a settlement and any amount payable will be included in the acquired balance sheet of
OMNOVA.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER DEBT**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to the_
_Indenture after giving effect to the Offering. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the_
_applicable terms and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual_
_agreements. Capitalized terms used in the following summaries and not otherwise defined in this Offering_
_Memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**Overview**

Following the completion of the Offering, our outstanding indebtedness will include the Notes and the 2019
Syndicated Facilities.

**2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview_**

The Issuer and certain other members of the Group have entered into the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement
Pursuant to the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Original Lenders (as defined therein) shall make
available the 2019 Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Syndicated Facilities
Agreement was used, in addition to refinancing amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Facility, towards
the acquisition of OMNOVA and payment of fees and costs in connection with the acquisition, refinancing certain
financial indebtedness of the OMNOVA Group and for working capital and general corporate purposes of the
Group.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Interest is payable on loans under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility at a
floating rate equal to LIBOR (or, in relation to any loan drawn in euro, EURIBOR) plus the applicable margin.

The margin that applies to the 2019 Term Loan Facility is determined in accordance with a ratchet based on the
ratio of consolidated total net borrowings to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein) (“Gearing
**Ratio”).**

The commitment fee on the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is 35% of the applicable margin per annum on the
unutilized and uncanceled amount of the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and accrues from the July 3, 2019 (the
“Signing Date”) to and including the last day of the availability period of the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The
commitment fee on the 2019 Term Loan Facility is (i) for the period from the Signing Date to but excluding the
date falling one month after the Signing Date, zero, (ii) for the period from one month after the Signing Date to
but excluding the date falling two months after the Signing Date, 10% of the margin applicable to the 2019 Term
Loan Facility at that time, (iii) for the period from the date falling two months after the Signing Date to but
excluding the date falling three months after the Signing Date, 20% of the margin applicable to the 2019 Term
Loan Facility at that time, and (iv) from the date falling three months after the Signing Date through until first
utilization of the 2019 Term Loan Facility, 35% of the margin applicable to the 2019 Term Loan Facility at that
time. The accrued commitment fee is payable on the last day of each successive period of three months which
ends during the period in which the commitment fee accrues, on the last day of the relevant availability period
and, if the relevant facility under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full, at the time the cancellation
is effective.

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement also contains a utilization fee in respect of the 2019 Revolving Credit
Facility, which applies if the amounts outstanding under a facility exceed 33% of the total commitments under
that facility of 0.20 per cent. per annum of any Lender’s participation in any outstanding loans under that facility
which increases to 0.40 per cent. per annum when the aggregate Loans (as defined therein) outstanding under that
facility exceed 66% of the total commitments under that facility.

Other fees are also payable under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement, including an agency fee paid annually
in advance to HSBC Bank PLC as facility agent (the “Agent”) and a one-off arrangement fee paid to the Arrangers
(as defined thereunder) on April 1, 2020 (the “Closing Date”).

**_Guarantees and Guarantor Coverage Test_**

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities are guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors. Under the 2019 Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, the Issuer must ensure that the Guarantor Group covers not less than 50% of the Adjusted
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein) of the Group (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”). If an entity within
the Group is required to accede to the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement as a guarantor to satisfy the Guarantor
Coverage Test (a “Potential Guarantor”), but is unable to become a guarantor under the 2019 Syndicated
Facilities Agreement due to it being unlawful for the relevant entity to become a guarantor and such entity
becoming a guarantor resulting in personal liability for that person’s directors or other management, such Potential
Guarantor is not required to accede to the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement. Each Potential Guarantor must
use, and must procure, that the relevant person uses, all reasonable endeavors lawfully available to avoid any such
unlawfulness or personal liability,

**_Covenants_**

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains positive covenants which apply to the Issuer and any other
borrowers and all of the guarantors under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement (together, the “Obligors”),
subject to certain agreed exceptions, which are typical for facilities of this type, including: (i) notification of
default; (ii) maintenance of required authorizations; (iii) maintenance of insurance; (iv) the Guarantor Coverage
Test; (v) certain information undertakings; (vi) compliance with applicable sanctions, anti-corruption,
environmental and other laws; (vii) payment of taxes; (viii) notification of environmental claims; and (ix) Pari
Passu ranking.

The Obligors are also subject to restrictive covenants, including covenants relating to:

- mergers;

- change of business;

- making acquisitions;

- creating security interests;

- disposing of assets;

- granting guarantees and indemnities; and

- other members of the Group incurring additional debt,

subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, including in cases where the “Majority Lenders” (lenders holding
66[2]/3% of the total commitments under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities) have consented to the relevant transaction.

**_Financial Covenant_**

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement requires that the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries maintain a
certain level of Gearing Ratio.

The Gearing Ratio is tested half-yearly, at the end of each financial year of the Issuer and financial half-year of
the Issuer, in each case in respect of the immediately preceding 12-month period (the “Test Dates”).

194


-----

Currently the Group’s financial year ends on December 31, and its financial half-year ends on June 30, each year.
The covenant level for the Gearing Ratio shall not exceed:

**Test Date** **Gearing Ratio**
The first and second Test Date falling after the Closing
Date ......................................................................... 4.25:1
The third and fourth Test Date falling after the Closing
Date ......................................................................... 4.0:1
The fifth and sixth Test Date falling after the Closing
Date ......................................................................... 3.5:1
Each Test Date thereafter ........................................... 3.25:1

**_Maturity_**

Amounts borrowed under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement must be repaid in full on the termination date,
which is five years after the date of the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement.

**_Prepayments_**

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains certain prepayment provisions, subject to certain
qualifications and exceptions, including:

- provisions for mandatory prepayment and cancellation in full of all facilities under the 2019 Syndicated
Facilities Agreement if any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the Issuer and,
during a period of negotiation of up to 30 days after the Issuer notifies the Agent of the change of control,
the Issuer and the lenders do not reach agreement on whether and how to continue with the facilities
under the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement (such prepayment and cancellation to occur on the tenth
day after the last day of such 30-day negotiation period); and

- provisions permitting voluntary prepayment of loans (subject to minimum amounts and prior notice).

**_Events of Default_**

The 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains a number of events of default, subject to certain grace periods
and other exceptions, including non-payment, failure to comply with financial covenants, failure to comply with

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

In this “Description of the Notes,” the term “Issuer” refers only to Synthomer plc and not to any of its Subsidiaries
(as defined hereafter), except for the purposes of financial data determined on a consolidated basis. The term
“Notes,” unless the context requires otherwise, also refers to “Book-Entry Interests” in the Notes, as defined
herein. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth throughout the text or under
“—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuer will issue €520,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”)
under an indenture dated on or about       , 2020 (the “Indenture”) among, _inter alios, the Issuer, the_
Guarantors and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as trustee (the “Trustee”), in private transactions that are not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The
terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €520,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
Notes will be issued in this Offering (the “Initial Notes”). We may in the future, subject to applicable law, issue
an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes (as defined below). We will only be permitted to issue
Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional
Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the
Indenture.

On the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Notes will be used, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repay
the Bridge Facilities and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the Offering.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Notes and the Indenture. It does not, however,
restate the Notes and the Indenture in their entirety and where reference is made to a particular provision of the
Notes or the Indenture, such reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by
reference to all of the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. You should read the Notes and the Indenture
because they contain additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as a
Holder of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture may be obtained from the Issuer at the address indicated under
“Listing and General Information.” The Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by
reference to, and is not otherwise subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including
Section 316(b) thereof.

Application will be made to admit the Notes to trading on the International Securities Market (the “ISM”) of the
London Stock Exchange. In the event the Notes are admitted to trading on an exchange other than the ISM,
references herein to the ISM shall be deemed to be to the relevant exchange upon which the Notes are listed. The
Issuer can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted. See “—Payments on the Notes; Paying
_Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar” and “Certain Covenants—Maintenance of Listing.”_

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

Each reference to a legal entity herein shall be deemed to include such entity’s successor in interest, unless the
context requires otherwise.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) will be the Issuer’s general senior unsecured obligations;

(b) will mature on         , 2025;

196


-----

(c) will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future unsecured obligations that
are not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including debt under the
Syndicated Facilities Agreement;

(d) will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(e) will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer, to the extent of
the value of such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless such property or assets also secure
the Notes on an equal and ratable or senior basis;

(f) will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not
provide Guarantees; and

(g) will be guaranteed on the Issue Date on a senior basis by the Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date.

Each Guarantee:

(a) will be a senior obligation of the Guarantor that granted such Guarantee;

(b) will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future unsecured obligations
that are not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including debt under
the Syndicated Facilities Agreement;

(c) will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee; and

(d) will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of such Guarantor, to the extent
of the value of such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless such property or assets also secure
such Guarantee on an equal and ratable or senior basis.

**_General_**

Not all of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer is a Holding Company
for the operating companies in the Group and is accordingly dependent on cash flows from its Subsidiaries to
meet its obligations under the Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Guarantors generated 69.7% of our unaudited pro forma EBITDA.
As of December 31, 2019, the Guarantors accounted for 56.2% of our total assets, with our total assets calculated
in this instance as the sum of the total assets of Synthomer as of December 31, 2019 and the total assets of
OMNOVA as of November 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the total borrowings of our non-Guarantor
subsidiaries, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom were
£0 million.

The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any right of
the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the
consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that
Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary subject
to any mandatory legal subordination, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinated in right
of payment to any security over the assets of the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary senior to that held by
the Issuer.

As at the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the

197


-----

Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further, Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee the Notes.

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the Guarantors and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial. The Indenture
will permit additional Debt to be secured.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee
being voidable or unenforceable or causing any personal liability of the Guarantor’s management under applicable
laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees— Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limit_
_validity and enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees —The insolvency_
_laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as those of another_
_jurisdiction with which you may be familiar” and “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.” Each_
Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any other
Guarantor. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt.”

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on       , 2025 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The redemption
price at maturity will be 100.0% of the principal amount. The Issuer will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of €520,000,000. Each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum of
% and interest will be payable semi-annually on
and of each year,
commencing on, 2020. Interest will be payable to Holders of record on
each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the Clearing System Business Day
immediately preceding the payment date, as the case may be; however, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors_
_must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.” If the due date_
for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day at the place where such payment is due to be paid,
the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount until the next succeeding Business Day at such
place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of such delay. The rights of
Holders in beneficial interest of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from, and including, the original issuance date or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the
covenants restricting the incurrence of Debt (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Debt”), the Issuer is permitted to issue one or more series of additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially_
identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee (the “Additional Notes”):

(a) the title of such Additional Notes;

(b) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(c) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

198


-----

(d) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date
or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
Holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(e) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(f) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions
upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(g) if other than denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(h) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional Notes.

At the Issuer’s election, Additional Notes may be established in one or more supplemental indentures to the
Indenture in lieu of an Officer’s Certificate under this provision. Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with
all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments
and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series, except as otherwise provided for in
the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of
_the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Initial Notes as well as any_
Additional Notes. Additional Notes may also be designated to be of the same series as the Initial Notes, and
references to the “Notes” shall be deemed to refer to the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes; provided,
_that if any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, they will be_
assigned a different ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number than the Notes.

**Transfer** **and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

      - Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

      - The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

      - Each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”).

      - The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests
in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of
Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written

199


-----

certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes payable
in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to
such Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer (as defined under “—Certain Covenants —Change of Control”) or an Asset Sale (as
defined under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”).

The Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be entitled to treat
the Holder as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, at its office
or through its agent in London, England that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that agent will be
Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the “Paying Agent”). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent without prior
notice to the Holders. The Issuer will make all payments in same-day funds.

200


-----

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London
Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time,
if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register
of the Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of
Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer
shall prevail.

Upon prior written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as they are admitted to
trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any
change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and
regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the
Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of
the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental
charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be unconditionally, jointly and severally, guaranteed on a senior basis by the
Guarantors. Under the Indenture, the Guarantors will jointly and severally agree to guarantee the due and punctual
payment of all amounts payable under the Notes, including principal, premium and Additional Amounts (as
defined herein), if any, and interest payable under the Notes. In the future, under certain circumstances, certain
other Subsidiaries may guarantee the Notes.

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or another
Subsidiary of the Issuer. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled
to contribution from any other Guarantor.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Guarantors generated 69.7% of our unaudited pro forma EBITDA.
As of December 31, 2019, the Guarantors accounted for 56.2% of our total assets, with our total assets calculated
in this instance as the sum of the total assets of Synthomer as of December 31, 2019 and the total assets of
OMNOVA as of November 30, 2019. See “Description of Other Debt—2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement—
_Guarantees and Guarantor Coverage Test” for a description of the guarantor coverage test contained in the_
Syndicated Facilities Agreement as of the Issue Date and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Debt” for a description of the limitation on Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors in the Indenture on_
guaranteeing Debt without providing a Guarantee of the Notes.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged
and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination)
or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of the Guarantor
(or a Holding Company thereof) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction)
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenants described
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;_

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of the Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any
Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a Holding
Company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a

201


-----

Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the provisions set forth below under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no
longer qualifies as a Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(3) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions under “—
_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”_

(4) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing;

(6) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(7) the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant
to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,” the
release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to
guarantee the Notes; or

(9) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee will execute, subject
to the receipt of certain Officer’s Certificates and an opinion of counsel, any documents reasonably required in
order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. Neither the Issuer
nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such Guarantee or any such
release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**_Limitations on the value of the Guarantees_**

Under the Indenture, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its
obligations under its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable or causing any personal liability of the
Guarantor’s management under applicable laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer,
fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and officers. By virtue of
these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations_
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defences that may limit_
_validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—Enforcing your_
_rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees_
_—The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany, and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as_
_those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar” and “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability_
_Considerations.”_

**_Additional Amounts_**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or
similar governmental charges of whatever nature (collectively, “Taxes”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of the
United Kingdom or any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or
resident for tax purposes, or from or through which payment on the Notes or the Guarantees is made, or any
political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, having the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction”), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. In the event that the Issuer

202


-----

or a Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts
(“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder of the Notes after
such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that such Holder would have received if such
Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a Holder of
any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of a present or former
connection of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial
owner is reasonably identifiable) with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to,
citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a place of
business or a place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other
than the mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case
of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) of any Note, to comply
with the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder, providing at least 30 calendar days’ notice, to satisfy
any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning nationality,
residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which the Holder or such beneficial
owner is legally required to satisfy, whether imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice,
in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in
the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, provided that the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to satisfy such
requirements);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to
any Note or Guarantee;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is required in
order to receive payment) by the Holder for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
such payment becomes due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever
occurs later, except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on
presenting the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period;

(f) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471–1474 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), any current or future regulations or official
interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered
into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(g) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to the Holder or
beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably
identifiable) if such Holder or beneficial owner is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment
had the beneficial owner been the Holder of the Note.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect of any
combination of the above items.

The Issuer or Guarantors will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and remit
the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all applicable

203


-----

laws. The Issuer will, upon request, make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s reasonable efforts
to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such
payment by the Issuer.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment
under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or
Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to
enable the Trustee or Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

In addition, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer,
documentation, court, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest or penalties with respect
thereto imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in respect of the execution, issue, delivery or
registration of the Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to
thereunder (other than transfers of the Notes following the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers);
and (ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the
enforcement of the Notes, Guarantees or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person to the_
Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in significant operations or resident for tax purposes or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
principal (and premiums, if any), redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to
any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts thereon.

**Optional Redemption**

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering,
the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the Notes, the incurrence of
indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption or notice
is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied _provided,_
_however, that, in any case such redemption date shall not be more than 60 days from the date on which such notice_
to holders of the Notes is first given, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption
date so delayed.

We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate, provided, however, that no ownership of interests in the Global Note of less than €100,000 principal
amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part. The Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar shall not be liable
for any selection made under this paragraph. If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the
notice of redemption relating to that Definitive Registered Note will state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. A new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion

204


-----

thereof will be issued and delivered in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such redemption or notice may, at
the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest

shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on such redemption date if it were a Business Day for the intervening

period.

The Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Excess Proceeds Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer,
and accordingly the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice to Holders of the Notes, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such tender offer at a price equal to
the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer,
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_,_** **_2022_** **_upon_** **_Equity_**
**_Offering_**

At any time prior to, 2022, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice to holders of the Notes, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes that were initially issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to the
issuance of any Additional Notes) at a redemption price of % of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date, with the net
proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued (calculated after giving
effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) would remain outstanding immediately after the proposed
redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2022_**

At any time prior to, 2022, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice to holders of the Notes, the Issuer may also redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption on or after_** **_, 2022_**

At any time on or after, 2022 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These
redemptions will be in amounts of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof at the following

205


-----

redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period
beginning         in each of the years set forth below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2022 ............................................................................................................................... %
2023 ............................................................................................................................... %
2024 and thereafter ........................................................................................................ 100.000%

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date and all Additional Amounts, if
any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
the Issuer determines in good faith that the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next date on which any amount
would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as defined above under
“—Additional Amounts”) in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof,
which the Issuer or Guarantor cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including making
payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction and, in the case of a Guarantor, making the
payment giving rise to such requirement by another Guarantor who would not be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts if payments through another Guarantor would be reasonable), as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under “—Additional Amounts”) affecting taxation
which is enacted or issued and becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction has changed since the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which the then current
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture; or

(b) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties, regulations or
rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction) on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction has changed since the
date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which the then current Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax
Law”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or
withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement
of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have occurred (including
that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or Guarantor taking
reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case
may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept, and is entitled to rely on, such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence,
without further enquiry, of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will
be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

206


-----

The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor person_
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Notice of Optional Redemption_**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
any notice of redemption to the Noteholders of the relevant Notes shall also be published to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the ISM of any
change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding. In addition to such publication, and to the extent and in the
manner so required by the rules of the ISM, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date,
the Issuer will mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as
they appear on the registration books of the Registrar, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. For Notes which are represented by Global Notes, notices may be
given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account
Holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. The Notes will be selected in accordance with the methods
described under “—Optional Redemption—General.”

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as
described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Asset Sales.” The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes_
in the open market or otherwise, at such price and on such terms as it sees fit.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee
or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for,
contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to “Incur” or, as appropriate, an
“Incurrence”), any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); _provided, that the Issuer and any Restricted_
Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if on the date on which such additional
Debt is Incurred the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s two most recent consecutive fiscal halves
for which internal consolidated financial statement are available prior to the date of determination, and after
giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis,
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(2) This “Limitation on Debt” covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, “Permitted

Issuer or a Guarantor, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the
performance in full of its obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a disposition,
pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any transaction pursuant to which

ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case, be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt
not permitted by this clause (d);

(e)(i) guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Debt is not prohibited under the terms of the Indenture; or

any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Debt is not prohibited under the terms of the Indenture;

(f) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt represented by Capitalized Lease
Obligations, mortgage financings, purchase money obligations or other Debt Incurred or assumed in

in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or any part of the purchase price,
lease expense or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property, plant, equipment
or other assets used or useful in the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s business (including any
reasonable related fees or expenses Incurred in connection with such acquisition, lease, rental or
development); provided that the principal amount of such Debt so Incurred when aggregated with such
other Debt previously Incurred in reliance on this clause (f) and still outstanding shall not in the aggregate
exceed the greater of £70.0 million and 28.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(g) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising from agreements providing for

limitation, shares of Capital Stock, other than guarantees or similar credit support given by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such assets for
the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of
all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (g) will at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including
non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received from the sale of such
assets;

Debt guaranteed;

(q) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Debt arising by reason of any

(t) (A) the Incurrence of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to finance an acquisition or any
merger or consolidation of any Person with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or

after giving effect thereto, either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur at least £1.00 of additional
Debt pursuant to paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect thereto;

(u) Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary relating to any VAT liabilities or deferral of PAYE taxes

other jurisdictions;

(v) any lease, concession, license or conveyance of property (or Guarantee thereof) which would be

209


-----

(x) the Incurrence of Debt by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than and in addition to Debt
permitted under clauses (a) through (y) above) in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not to exceed the greater of £70.0 million and 28.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, in the event that an item
of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses
(a) through (x) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
“Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Debt on the date of its
Incurrence in any manner that complies with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant. Debt Incurred under the
Syndicated Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date in
reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of paragraph (2) above, and Debt Incurred under the
Syndicated Facilities pursuant to clause (a) of paragraph (2) above may not be reclassified as Debt Incurred
under paragraph (1) above. In addition, from time to time any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred
pursuant to one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (b) through (x) of paragraph (2)
above, or entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, may later
be reclassified by the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to such new clause
of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant to the extent that such reclassified
Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such new clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on
_Debt” covenant at the time of such reclassification. Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted_
solely by reference to one provision permitting such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Debt.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in Sterling where
Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Sterling Equivalent
determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to Sterling) covering principal amounts payable
on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in Sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect
of such agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in the same currency
as the Debt being refinanced will be the Sterling Equivalent of the Debt being refinanced determined on the
date such Debt being refinanced was initially Incurred. For purposes of determining compliance with any
restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in euro where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount
of such Debt will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any
such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to euro)
covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in euro will be adjusted
to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Debt
Incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Debt being
refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced was initially Incurred. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this
“Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies
will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under
this “Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(5) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “Limitation on Debt” covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees, Liens, bankers’ acceptance or other similar
instrument or obligation, in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination of such
particular amount will not be included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the “Limitation on Liens”
covenant will not be treated as Debt;

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount or of
accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest or dividends in the
form of additional Debt, will not, in any case, be treated as Debt; and

(d) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Debt incurred to refinance
Debt initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would

210


-----

cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced, plus premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, take any of the
following actions (each of which is a “Restricted Payment” and which are collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”):

(a) declare or pay any dividend on or make any distribution (whether made in cash, securities or other
property) with respect to any of the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including,
without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) except for dividends or distributions payable solely in shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital
Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire such shares of Qualified Capital Stock or in
Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(b) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection
with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination), directly or indirectly, any shares
of the Issuer’s Capital Stock or any Capital Stock of a Holding Company of the Issuer held by persons
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire such
shares of Capital Stock;

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value,
prior to any scheduled principal payment, sinking fund payment or Stated Maturity, any Subordinated
Debt (other than (i) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition
or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or final
maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (ii) intercompany Debt between the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary or among Restricted Subsidiaries);

(d) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem,
defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than any
payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Debt); or

(e) make any Restricted Investment in any Person.

If any Restricted Payment described above is not made in cash, the amount of the proposed Restricted
Payment will be the Fair Market Value of the asset to be transferred as at the date of transfer.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make a Restricted Payment
if, at the time of and after giving pro forma effect to such proposed Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) the Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of
the “Limitation on Debt” covenant; and

(c) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments declared or made after the Issue Date, and after giving
effect to any reductions required by paragraph (4) below, does not exceed the sum of:

(i) 50% of aggregate Consolidated Net Income on a cumulative basis during the period beginning on
January 1, 2020 and ending on the last day of the Issuer’s last fiscal half ending prior to the date of
such proposed Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income shall
be a negative number, minus 100% of such negative amount); plus

211


-----

(ii) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable
securities received by the Issuer after the Issue Date as equity capital contributions or from the
issuance or sale (other than to any Subsidiary) of shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock
(including upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights) or warrants, options or rights to purchase
shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock (except, in each case to the extent such proceeds are
used to purchase, redeem or otherwise retire Capital Stock or Subordinated Debt as set forth in
clauses (d) or (e) of paragraph (3) below) (excluding (x) any Contribution Amounts and (y) the Net
Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received
from the issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds
borrowed from the Issuer or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(iii) (x) the amount by which the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the
Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet after the Issue Date upon the conversion or exchange (other than
by a Subsidiary) of such Debt into the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock and (y) the aggregate Net
Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received
after the Issue Date by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to any Subsidiary) of
Redeemable Capital Stock that has been converted into or exchanged for the Issuer’s Qualified
Capital Stock, to the extent such Redeemable Capital Stock was originally sold for cash or Cash
Equivalents, together with, in the case of both clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds
and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer at the
time of such conversion or exchange (excluding the Net Cash Proceeds from the issuance of the
Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the
Issuer or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(iv) (x) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any Restricted Investment,
proceeds realized upon the sale or other disposition to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of
assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest payments or returns of capital) to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, less the cost of the disposition of such Investment and net of
taxes, (y) if such Investment constituted a guarantee, an amount equal to the amount of such
guarantee upon the full and unconditional release of such guarantee and (z) in the case of the
designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (as long as the designation of
such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market
Value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary; plus

(v) in the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes any Investment in a Person that, as a
result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal

Person that was previously treated as a Restricted Payment.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may take the
following actions; provided that solely with respect to clauses (n), (o) and (r) below, no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing:

(a) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 90 days after the date of its
declaration or giving of notice of redemption, as applicable, if at such date of its declaration or giving of
notice of redemption, as applicable, such payment would have been permitted by the provisions of this
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant;

(b) cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to the exchange or conversion of any
exchangeable or convertible securities;

(c) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition, cancellation or retirement for

to permit any Parent to purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire, cancel or retire for
value Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (including any options,
warrants or other rights in respect thereof), or payments to purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or

212


-----

otherwise acquire, cancel or retire for value Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent (including any options, warrants or other rights in respect thereof), in each case, from, or for the

sale of Capital Stock (including any options, warrants or other rights in respect thereof) to any
current or former officer, director or employee of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent;
plus

(iii) the Net Cash Proceeds of key man life insurance policies, in each case, to the extent such Net Cash
Proceeds are not included in any calculation under clause (2)(c)(ii) of this covenant, and

_provided, further, that cancellation of Debt owing to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from_
members of management, directors or employees of any Parent, the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries
in connection with a repurchase of Capital Stock of the Issuer or any Parent will not be deemed to
constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other provision of the Indenture;

(d) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any shares of the Issuer’s
Capital Stock or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock in exchange for (including
any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which

substantially concurrent issuance and sale (other than to a Subsidiary) of, shares of the Issuer’s Qualified
Capital Stock or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Debt (excluding any Contribution Amounts);

(e) the prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement for value or payment of principal of any Subordinated Debt in exchange for, or out of the Net
Cash Proceeds of the issuance and sale (other than to a Subsidiary) of, shares of the Issuer’s Qualified
Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(f) the prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement for value of Subordinated Debt (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) in exchange for, or out

(g) the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution to holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary on a pro rata basis or on a basis that results in the receipt by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of dividends or distributions of greater value than the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
would receive on a pro rata basis;

(h) the repurchase of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options with respect to which
payment of the cash exercise price has been forgiven if the cumulative aggregate value of such deemed
repurchases does not exceed the cumulative aggregate amount of the exercise price of such options
received;

(i) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of Redeemable Capital Stock
issued in accordance with the “Limitation on Debt” covenant;

213


-----

(j) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of Capital Stock deemed
to occur upon the exercise of stock options, warrants or other securities, if such Capital Stock represents
a portion of the exercise price of such options, warrants or other securities;

(k) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated
Debt of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to provisions similar to those described
under “—Change of Control;” provided that all Notes validly tendered by Holders in connection with a
Change of Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value, as applicable;

(l) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary with any Excess Proceeds remaining after consummation of an Excess Proceeds
Offer pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Asset Sales;”

(m) Permitted Parent Payments;

and other Persons with which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a
consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a part of a group
for tax purposes; provided, however, that such payments will not exceed the amount of tax that the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries would owe on a standalone basis and the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries are relieved by the payment of such amounts to a relevant taxing authority;

(q) the distribution, as a dividend or otherwise, of shares of Capital Stock of, or Debt owed to, the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary by Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(r) the declaration and payment by the Issuer of, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent
to pay, dividends on the common stock or common equity interests of the Issuer or any Parent, in an
amount not to exceed in any fiscal year the greater of (a) 6% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the
Issuer from any Public Offering or contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Redeemable Capital Stock or Preferred Stock) of the Issuer or loaned as Subordinated Shareholder Debt
to the Issuer, in each case after the Issue Date and (b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) the greater of
(A) 7% of the Market Capitalization and (B) 7% of the Issue Date Market Capitalization; and

(s) payment of any Receivables Fees and purchases of receivables and other assets pursuant to a Receivables
Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing.

(4) The actions described in clauses (a) and (n) of paragraph (3) above are Restricted Payments that will be
permitted to be made in accordance with paragraph (3) but that will reduce the amount that would otherwise
be available for Restricted Payments under clause (c) of paragraph (2) above.

(5) In the event an item meets the criteria of more than one category of Permitted Investment and/or Restricted
Payment, as applicable, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may classify any Permitted Investment or other
Restricted Payment as being made in part under one of the clauses or sub-clauses of this covenant (or, in the
case of any Permitted Investment, the clauses or sub-clauses of Permitted Investments) and in part under one
or more other such clauses or sub-clauses.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer
to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase,
exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate
of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater than the greater of £15.0 million and

214


-----

6.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, unless such transaction or series of transactions is entered into in good faith
and:

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been
obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) with a
Person that is not an Affiliate; and

(b) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments or the
transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than the greater of £30.0
million and 12.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will deliver a resolution of its Board of Directors
(attached to an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee) resolving that such transaction complies with clause
(a) above and that the fairness of such transaction has been approved by a majority of the Disinterested
Members, if any, of the Board of Directors.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(a) reasonable directors’ fees, indemnities and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors’ and
officers’ insurance premiums), consulting and advisory fees, employee compensation, employee and
director bonuses, directorship, employment or consulting agreements and arrangements, collective
bargaining agreements, employee benefit arrangements, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements or legal
fees payable to any current or former employee, officer or director as long as the Issuer’s Board of
Directors has approved the terms thereof and deemed the services performed or thereafter to be
performed for amounts to be fair consideration therefor;

(b) Permitted Investments (other than pursuant to clause (c)(iii), (q) or (u) of the definition thereof) and any
Restricted Payment not prohibited by the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant;

(c) any Management Advances or Permitted Parent Payments and any waiver or transaction with respect
thereto;

(d) agreements, instruments and arrangements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment, extension,
renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement thereto and any payments or transaction in relation
thereto; provided that any such amendment, extension, renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement
to the terms thereof is not more disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), taken as a
whole, to the Holders of the Notes and to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any
material respect than the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(e) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar transfers
pursuant to, or for the purpose of the funding of, directorship, employment or consulting arrangements,
stock options, stock ownership plans and other similar arrangements, as long as the terms thereof are or
have been previously approved by the Issuer’s Board of Directors;

(f) the granting and performance of registration rights for the Issuer’s securities;

(g) transactions between or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(h) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Issuer or options, warrants
or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock);

(i) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreement relating thereto) to which it is a party as at the Issue Date and any similar agreements which
it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of, obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by

215


-----

this clause (i) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to the Holders of the
Notes when taken as a whole;

(j) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary solely (x) because
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock in such Person (including, without limitation,
any such Person that is a Captive Insurance Company), (y) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
has the right to designate one or more members of the Board of Directors or similar governing body of
such Person, or (z) as a result of both such ownership of Capital Stock and such right to so designate;

(k) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case
in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary or are on terms materially no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(l) the execution of, delivery of and performance under any Tax Sharing Agreement; and

(m) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit
to exist any Lien on any of its property or assets, whether owned on the date of the Indenture or thereafter
acquired, securing any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (the “Initial Lien”), unless (i) such
Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Notes
and the Indenture or, in respect of Liens on property or assets of any Guarantor, such Guarantee thereof,
equally and ratably with (or, in the case of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor on a senior basis
to) such Debt for so long as such Debt is so secured by such Initial Lien.

(2) Any such Lien created as a result of this covenant “Limitation on Liens” in favor of the Notes or any such
Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge
of the Initial Lien to which it relates.

(3) With respect to any Lien securing Debt that was permitted to secure such Debt at the time of the Incurrence
of such Debt, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Debt. The “Increased
Amount” of any Debt shall mean any increase in the amount of such Debt in connection with any accrual of
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest
in the form of additional Debt with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Debt outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Debt.

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each
Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal amount of €100,000 or
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”)
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”).

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer
by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes
appearing in the security register on such date, which notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

216


-----

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a business
day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is mailed, or such later date
as is necessary to comply with any requirements under the Exchange Act or any other applicable
securities laws or regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on
such date;

(e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to
withdraw such acceptance.

(3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee will promptly
authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes
surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of certificated Notes; provided
that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the
Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under “Optional
Redemption” or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the
manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal
to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such tender
offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such Note
would remain outstanding following such purchase.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-l under the
Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will
not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global
Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default under the
Syndicated Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain provisions
that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased. In addition, the exercise by the Holders
of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default
under the Syndicated Facilities and any such future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors of such repurchase. Not all business combinations or
acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change of Control and may not result in a Change
of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require
the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger
or similar transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined
as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of

217


-----

the Indenture, including those described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” The existence,
however, of a Holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change
of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would
constitute a Change of Control.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available
funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders
of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of
any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled
maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite
consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change
of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase
Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default.” An Event of Default under the Indenture,
unless waived, would result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under
“Description of Other Debt,” including under the Syndicated Facilities.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers” below.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by the Issuer,
and the Issuer’s determination (including the Board of Directors’ determination, as applicable) will be
conclusive (as to the value of any and all non-cash consideration));

(b) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 180 days of such
Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Sale);

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other
than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary
is released from any guarantee of such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

218


-----

(v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
in such Asset Sale; _provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Designated Non-cash_
Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time of receipt of all other
Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (v), less the amount of Net Cash
Proceeds previously realized in cash from prior Designated Non-cash Consideration does not exceed
(with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at
the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of £50.0
million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA; or

(vi) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (v); and

(c) the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such Asset Sale complies with
the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Sale, within 540 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or any such
Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net Cash Proceeds
are so used within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 540 day period), may be used by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) to prepay, redeem, repay or purchase any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not
Subordinated Debt (including the Notes) or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments constituting Debt that is not Subordinated Debt) cash collateralize any such Debt (in
each case other than Debt owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and, if the Debt prepaid,
redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Debt, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto
(except that no such reduction will be required to the extent that such Debt would, immediately after
giving effect to such prepayment, repayment, repurchase or redemption, have been capable of being
reincurred under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Debt”);_

(b) to invest in any Replacement Assets or make capital expenditures (including by means of capital
expenditure by, or an investment in Replacement Assets by, a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount
equal to some or all of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary);
or

(c) do any combination of the foregoing.

(d) The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds actually received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary but
not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes “Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application
of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £35.0 million and 14.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will, within 30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an “Excess
Proceeds Offer”) from all Holders of Notes and, at the Issuer’s election, from the holders of any Pari Passu
Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount,
in the case of the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the
Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an
amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note being repurchased
and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value,
as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt being redeemed or repurchased, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant
to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use the
amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt for any purposes that are

219


-----

not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based
upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt
tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari Passu
Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from
the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such Holders, or such later date as may be required
under the Exchange Act.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise use the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender
offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and
regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are then listed.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this
“Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant by
virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt outstanding under any
Credit Facility Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt” or any
other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless such Restricted Subsidiary
either (i) is not a Significant Subsidiary and, in respect of any Debt outstanding under the Syndicated Facilities
(as may be refinanced, amended or restated from time to time) only, has not become a Guarantor under the
Syndicated Facilities, provided that any such Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary also
would not, in the aggregate when taken together with other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant
Subsidiaries, constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single person or (ii) executes and delivers
within 30 days a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes
by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such other Debt; and with respect to any
guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to
such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such
Subordinated Debt is subordinated to the Notes. Any Guarantee of payment of the Notes may contain
limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer)
to recognize certain defences generally available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law
or regulation.

(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
existing on the Issue Date or that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the
guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary.

(3) Any Guarantee of the Notes granted pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this
covenant may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances described under the heading “—Guarantees—Release
_of the_ _Guarantees.” A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at_
the date of such release there is no Debt of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release
if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. At the cost and reasonable request of
the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions to effectuate any release of any Guarantee of the Notes
in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

220


-----

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the Notes to the extent such Guarantee would reasonably be expected (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer) to give rise to or result in (a) any conflict with or violation of applicable law, rule, regulation
or order; (b) any risk of liability (civil, criminal, administrative or other) for the officers, directors,
shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable guarantee or similar fee payable to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable expenses and other than reasonable governmental
expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any
measures pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock
or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (ii) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case,
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the “Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
_Subsidiaries” covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:_

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Syndicated
Facilities;

(b) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt permitted to be Incurred under Credit Facilities or any
guarantee thereof in accordance with the “Limitation on Debt” covenant or pursuant to paragraph (2) of
such “Limitation on Debt” covenant; provided that in the case of any such encumbrances or restrictions
imposed under any Credit Facilities, such encumbrances or restrictions taken as a whole are not
materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than those imposed by the Syndicated Facilities
as at the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument in effect on the Issue Date;

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances and
restrictions: (i) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any properties
or assets that are subject to a lease, sublease, license, sublicense, conveyance or other similar agreement
to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party; or (ii) contained in operating leases for real
property and restricting only the transfer of such real property upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a default in the payment of rent;

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person or relating to
assets acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but
not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person,
or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person,
so acquired;

221


-----

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets permitted by the
“Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant with respect to the assets or Capital Stock to be sold pursuant to
such contract or in customary merger or acquisition agreements (or any option to enter into such contract)
for the purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or assets or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries by another
Person;

(g) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law or regulation or by governmental licenses,
authorizations, concessions, franchises or permits;

(h) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers
or surety, insurance or bonding companies under contracts entered into the ordinary course of business;

(i) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property of a Restricted Subsidiary
in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale and leaseback agreements, shareholder
agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into the ordinary course of
business and in good faith; provided that:

(i) the encumbrance or restriction is not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than
is customary in comparable agreements (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); and

(ii) the Issuer determines in good faith that any such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect
the ability of the Issuer or any Guarantor to make any principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(j) customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection with purchase money obligations, mortgage
financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business;

(k) any encumbrance or restriction arising by reason of customary non-assignment or similar provisions in
agreements;

(l) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Debt not
prohibited from being Incurred after the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Debt:” (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); or
(ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes
than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(m) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances or
restrictions existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens;”

(n) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any Hedging Agreements;

(o) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property
interests set forth in any reciprocal easements agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(p) any encumbrance or restriction that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and does not
detract from the value of property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner
material to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(q) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(r) any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,
extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts,
instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (q), or in this clause (r), of this paragraph
(2); _provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, extension, increases,_
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no
more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances or restrictions than those contained

222


-----

in the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal,
extension, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly established
Subsidiaries) to cease to be a “Restricted Subsidiary” and instead to be an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation;

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant (and
may classify such amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments and ability to make payments
that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant
as it sees fit) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s interest in such
Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s interest in
such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith); and

(c) the Issuer would be permitted under the Indenture to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to
the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant at the time of such designation
(assuming the effectiveness of such designation).

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment constituting a
Restricted Payment pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant for all purposes of the
Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary
calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary
(in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith), and may classify such amount within its capacity to
make Restricted Payments and permissions to make payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments
under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant as it sees fit.

(3) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur and be
continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) unless such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not have any Debt outstanding (other than Debt that
would be Permitted Debt), immediately before and after giving effect to such proposed designation, and
after giving _pro forma effect to the Incurrence of any such Debt of such designated Unrestricted_
Subsidiary as if such Debt was Incurred on the date of its designation as a Restricted Subsidiary, the
Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the
“Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors with the
Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation
complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such designation. Any such filing
with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal half year in which such
designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the second fiscal half year of the Issuer’s
fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will use its commercially reasonable efforts to admit the Notes to trading
on the ISM of the London Stock Exchange as promptly as practicable and will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the ISM for so long as the notes are outstanding; provided that if at
any time the Issuer determines that it will not or cannot maintain such listing, it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the ISM, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of

223


-----

the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom or their admission to trading on a multilateral trading facility
(within the meaning of Section 987 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007) which is operated by a recognised stock
exchange regulated in the EEA (or, following the expiration of the Brexit transitional period, regulated in the
U.K., EEA or Gibraltar).

**_Reports to Holders_**

(1) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including
complete notes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the
Issuer; (c) a description of the business of the Issuer; and (d) a description of management and
shareholders, material debt instruments, material affiliate transactions, material risk factors and material
subsequent events all in substantially the same form as presented in the Offering Memorandum, within
120 days following the end of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020;
_provided that the information in clause (d) may be provided in the notes to the audited financial_
statements.

(b) semi-annual financial information of the Issuer on a consolidated basis as of and for the period from the
beginning of each year to the close of the first half period, together with comparable information for the
corresponding period of the preceding year, and an operating and financial review of the financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and material changes
in liquidity and financial resources of the Issuer within 90 days following the end of the fiscal half
beginning with the fiscal half ending June 30, 2020; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, any change of the
Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer
or any other material event, a report containing a description of such event.

(2) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure
not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

(3) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the semi-annual and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports to Holders” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(4) For so long as it remains so listed, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that the Issuer
is required to make publicly available under the requirements of the London Stock Exchange as a result of
having its ordinary shares admitted for trading on such exchange. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this
covenant, upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements of the London Stock Exchange
(regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such exchange), to the extent
that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual reports,
information, documents and other reports, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in clauses (1)(a), (b) and (c) above.

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee,
the Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information referenced above in
clauses (1)(a), (b) and (c) and (3) above or alternatively, in the preceding paragraph, has been posted on the
Issuer’s website.

224


-----

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Report to Holders” covenant
is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such information, documents and reports shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of
the covenants under the Indenture. All reports made pursuant to this covenant shall be made in, or translated to,
the English language.

**_Statement as to Compliance_**

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee no later than the date on which the Issuer is required to deliver annual reports
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Reports to Holders” above, an Officer’s Certificate stating that in
the course of the performance by the relevant officers of their respective duties as an officer of the Issuer they
would normally have knowledge of any Default and whether or not such officers know of any Default that
occurred during such period and, if any, specifying such Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

**_Issuer_**

(1) The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge,
consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which the Issuer would dispose
of, all or substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ properties and assets, taken as a
whole, to any other Person. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving
effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed
by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or to which such
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been made (the “Surviving
Entity”):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member state of
the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United States of America, any state thereof, or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland; and

(y) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, an accession agreement or one or more other
documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (and
treating any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with or as a result of
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (on the
assumption that the transaction or series of transactions occurred on the first day of the fiscal half
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate
adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such pro forma
calculation), (i) the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor under the
Indenture) could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of
the “Limitation on Debt” covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale,

225


-----

assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required
in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements of the
Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
or the Surviving Entity, enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to customary assumptions,
exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, provided, however, that in the case of a lease of all or substantially
all of the Issuer’s assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest, on the Notes.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) the Issuer from consolidating or otherwise combining with or merging into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the
Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Issuer, _provided the requirements of_
clauses (a)(x) and (d) of paragraph (1) above are satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of any merger of the Issuer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules
and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of
the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream instead of mail.

**_Guarantors_**

(1) Subject to the provisions described under “—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,” no Guarantor will,
directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by such Guarantor’s Board of
Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which such Guarantor will
dispose of, all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s properties and assets to any other Person. The previous
sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of
transactions:

(a) either: (i) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation, or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation organized or existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, the United
States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor), by a supplemental indenture, an accession
agreement or one or more other documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, expressly assumes the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture;

(c) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and
is continuing; and

(d) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
opinion of counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is
required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture and the Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor or Successor Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

226


-----

(2) The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property
or assets of a Person.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the
provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(2) “—Limitation on Debt;”

(3) “—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(5) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt;”

(6) clause (1)(c) of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” in respect of each of the Issuer and the
Guarantors;

(7) “—Limitation on Asset Sales;” and

(8) “—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries.”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Issuer nor any Restricted
Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described
under the caption “—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” unless such designation would
have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such
covenant would have been in effect during such period.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension
Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Debt.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default,_
the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having
an Investment Grade Status. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this

227


-----

caption has been satisfied, _provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the_
covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of
the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status
or upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or
maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial calculations for Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of
Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition
Transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition
Transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio).

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such
basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Fixed Charges of the
Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction and the
related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions
(including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date
the definitive agreements are entered into and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or
ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited
Condition Transaction.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon acceleration,
optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure by the Issuer to comply with the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
_of Assets;”_

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
contained in the Indenture (other than specified in clauses (a), (b) or (c) (solely as it relates to the Issuer)
above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt for borrowed money (other than
any such Debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if
that default:

(i) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt; or

(ii) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of
any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required prepayment) and such
failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a
“Payment Default”),

228


-----

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Debt, together with the principal amount of any other
such Debt under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates to the greater of £50.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA or more;

(f) any Guarantee by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing
by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other
than as provided for in the Indenture or any Guarantee), if such Default continues for 10 days;

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by insurance) shall have
been rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for the payment of money either individually
or in an aggregate amount, in each case in excess of the greater of £50.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA (after deducting any insurance or indemnity or contribution amounts actually recovered by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days of such judgment, order or decree), and either a creditor shall
have commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such judgment, order or decree or there shall have been a
period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree
was not (by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in effect; and

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, schemes of arrangement (where any
creditors are materially impaired) or reorganization with respect to the Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary, or
of other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would, in the aggregate, when taken
together (as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period) constitute a Significant Subsidiary if
considered as a single Person.

However, a Default under clauses (d), (e) or (g) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the
Default and, with respect to clauses (d) and (g) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in
clauses (d) or (g) above, as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (h) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the
Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written request
of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on
all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable
in respect of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if
any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of
Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (e) under
“Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (e) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such
Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured
or waived.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of
the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture (except a default in the payment of
the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which case, the consent of
the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind any such acceleration with respect
to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction, and provided that the fees and expenses of the Trustee have been paid.

229


-----

No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any
remedy thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such
proceedings as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding
within 60 days after receipt of such written notice and receipt of indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it and
the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however,
apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Note.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer
of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will deliver to each Holder
of the Notes notice of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of an
Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes,
the Trustee may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if it determines in good faith that
withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of the Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge or written notice, that the Issuer is
duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and
that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders provide to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity of the
Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes (“Legal Defeasance”). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged
the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and
segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default other than an Event of Default under clauses (a) or (b) of the definition thereof.

230


-----

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and
thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events
_of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events will not include_
events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise
its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee, or such other entity as
may be designated for this purpose, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in euros, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an
internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must:

(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; and

(ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the outstanding Notes;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published
by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that (and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that) the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing: (i) on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit); or
(ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in clause (h) of “—Events of Default” above are
concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
Default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied
to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or instrument to which the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions,
exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability) in the country of the
Issuer’s incorporation to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions, exceptions,
reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability) reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee that the Trustee shall have a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the rateable benefit of
the Holders of the Notes;

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by
the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or other creditors, or removing

231


-----

assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing debts of the Issuer to the detriment of the
relevant creditors;

(h) no event or condition exists that would prevent the Issuer from making payments of the principal of, premium,
if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any time ending on the
123rd day after the date of such deposit; and

(i) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as
the case may be, have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee or such other entity to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of any
acceleration occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain liable for such
payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration
of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity as is
designated for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euros or European Government
Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that have not, prior to such time,
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts
and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have
become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen Notes
that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been deposited on trust or
segregated and held on trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust
as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation: (x) have become due and
payable (by reason of the mailing, or delivery to the clearing systems in the case of a Global Note, of a
notice of redemption or otherwise); (y) will become due and payable within one year of Stated Maturity;
or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year of the proposed discharge date under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuer’s
name and at the Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture; provided
that if requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included
in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate) no later than five (5) Business
Days or such shorter period as the Trustee or the Paying Agent may agree prior to such distribution, the
Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts deposited prior to maturity or the redemption date,
as the case may be; provided, further, that in such case, the payment to each Holder will equal the amount
such Holder would have been entitled to receive at maturity or on the relevant redemption date, as the case
may be, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or
relevant redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break cost or any other premium on such amounts;

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Notes at maturity, on the redemption date or such earlier date as instructed by the Issuer in
accordance with clause (b) above, as the case may be; and

232


-----

(d) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate and (ii) an opinion of counsel (subject to
customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to
enforceability), each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without
independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact)
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)(i)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
such Notes), the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or supplement the Indenture
(including the Guarantees) or the Notes, or waive any default or compliance with any provisions thereof (unless
a modification or amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, in which case only the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in such series shall be required);
_provided that no such modification, amendment or waiver may, without the consent of Holders holding not less_
than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (or, if a modification or
amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in such series):

(a) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of or Additional Amounts or interest on, any
Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (a) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate of or extend
the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause
(b) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(c) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption;”

(d) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional Amounts
or the interest thereon is payable on or after the due dates thereof;

(e) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance with the
provisions of such Note and the Indenture;

(f) make any change to the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence; and

(g) release any Guarantee, other than in compliance with the guarantor release provisions of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture (including the Guarantees) or the Notes, as applicable,
to:

(a) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by any such
successor of the covenants in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, in accordance with
“—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” or Permitted Reorganization;

(b) add to the Issuer’s covenants or those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes for the
benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any
Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes, as applicable, in the Indenture, the Notes or any
Guarantee;

(c) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect error or inconsistency;

233


-----

(d) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee to any provision of this Description of the
Notes to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim or
substantially verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) release any Guarantor in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture;

(f) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,”
to add Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien or any amendment in respect thereof with respect
to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is not prohibited
by the Indenture;

(g) evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture;

(h) make any change that would provide additional rights of or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under
the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee (as determined by the Issuer in good faith in respect of Holders);
and

(i) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted by the terms of and
limitations set forth in the Indenture.

The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel
as to the permissibility of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment to the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of the
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other
than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in
the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a Holder of the
Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute
a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
possible to purchase euro on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that
could be recovered following such a purchase is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient
under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the recipient against the cost
of the recipient’s making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes of
this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Trustee and/or Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had
the actual purchase of euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or
recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have
been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount
in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

234


-----

**Notices**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to the extent and in
the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by
Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream instead of mail.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed; and provided, further, that any notice delivered via e-mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to
have been “sent” in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder
shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any
defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed
in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear
or Clearstream.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by
accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release will be part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a
responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default,
of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of Trustee in accordance with the notice
provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture
and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed
as an obligation or duty. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, certain taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

“Acquired Debt” means Debt of a Person:

(a) existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged into or consolidated with the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

235


-----

(b) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from any such Person,

_provided that, in each case, such Debt was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such_
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition, as the case may be.

Acquired Debt shall be deemed to be Incurred on the date the acquired Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary
(or is merged into or consolidated with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) or the date of
the related acquisition of assets from any Person.

“Affiliate” means, with respect to any specified Person any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person.

For the purposes of this definition, “control,” when used with respect to any specified Person, means the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, directly or indirectly, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms “controlling,” “controlled”
have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

“Agent” means the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent.

“Applicable Redemption Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any redemption date, the greater of:

(a) 1.0% of the principal amount of the Note; and

(b) the excess of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of: (x) the redemption price of such Note at
, 2022 (such redemption price being set forth in the
table appearing below the caption “Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption on or after

Shareholder Debt, such Debt shall constitute an Incurrence of such Debt by the Issuer, and any and all
Restricted Payments made through the use of the net proceeds from the Incurrence of such Debt since the
date of the original issuance of such Subordinated Shareholder Debt shall constitute new Restricted Payments
that are deemed to have been made after the date of the original issuance of such Subordinated Shareholder
Debt.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Notes
sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation **S Global Notes” and,**
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global **Notes”). On the date the notes are delivered in book entry**
form, as set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, the Global Notes will be deposited with, or on
behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as
operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered
in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book Entry Interests, the “Book Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants or otherwise in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture governing the Notes and any applicable
securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Book Entry Interests will be shown on,
and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book entry form by Euroclear and
Clearstream and their participants. The Book Entry Interests in the Notes will be issued only in denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its
nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under
the Indenture.

Neither we, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee, nor any of our or their respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

**DEFINITIVE REGISTERED NOTES**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form
(the “Definitive **Registered** **Notes”):**

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within four months,

- if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee and the Paying Agent in writing that it elects to exchange
in whole, but not in part, the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes,

- if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture, or

263


-----

- if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of the
owner and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in the section entitled “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is
not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar, or any
of our or their respective agents, shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes, however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable.

**REDEMPTION OF THE GLOBAL NOTE**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominee), as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so
redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect
of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Paying
Agent for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the Paying
Agent to markdown, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount
of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that,
under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any
time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate, provided, however,
that, subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000
principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**PAYMENTS ON THE GLOBAL NOTE**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the_
extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts,” the Issuer will pay additional amounts
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of BookEntry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would
have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such
withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will
govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and
any of our or their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (for example, the nominee
for the Common Depositary of Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, nor any of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

264


-----

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear or
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

**CURRENCY OF PAYMENT FOR THE GLOBAL NOTE**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Note,
will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto, Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor
any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any
commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with any such payment.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**TRANSFERS**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed under “Notice to Investors.”

Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the forms provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available). See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

Subject to the foregoing, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the
transferor of a written certification (in the forms provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Notice to Investors,” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or
any other relevant jurisdiction.

265


-----

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global
Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in another Global
Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a
Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long
as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding
of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the
balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued. The Issuer will
bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

**INFORMATION CONCERNING EUROCLEAR AND CLEARSTREAM**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor
the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Since Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require
that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear
or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**GLOBAL CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT UNDER THE BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the ISM, and any permitted
secondary market trading activity in such Notes will therefore be required to be settled in immediately available
funds.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, or any of our
or their respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

266


-----

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
immediately available funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at
the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located
to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

267

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain tax consequences of the Offering and is intended as general information_
_only. Tax legislation, including in the country where the investor is domiciled or tax resident and in the Issuer’s_
_country of incorporation, may have an impact on the income that an investor receives from the Notes. Prospective_
_holders of Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the tax laws of_
_the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of the Notes, including, without limitation, the consequences_
_of the receipt of interest and premium, if any, on any sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

**U.K. TAXATION**

_The following, which applies only to persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes, is a general_
_summary of the Issuer’s understanding of current U.K. tax law and HM Revenue and Customs published practice_
_in the U.K. as at the date of this Offering Memorandum (which may be subject to change, sometimes with_
_retrospective effect) relating to certain U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes. It is not intended to be_
_exhaustive or to constitute legal or tax advice. The summary relates to U.K. withholding tax on payments of_
_interest in respect of the Notes and to U.K. stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”), and does not deal_
_with any other U.K. taxation implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of the Notes. Some aspects may not_
_apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities. Prospective holders of the Notes who may be_
_subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the U.K., or who are in any doubt as to their tax position, should seek_
_their own professional advice._

**Interest on the Notes**

While the Notes continue to be admitted to trading on a multilateral trading facility operated by “an EEA-regulated
recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Sections 987 (as amended) and 1005 Income Tax Act 2007,
payments of interest by the Issuer may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of U.K.
income tax. The ISM is a multilateral trading facility operated by an EEA-regulated recognised stock exchange
(the London Stock Exchange) for these purposes. The Taxes (Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the
“Regulations”) are intended to ensure the continuity of certain tax arrangements following Brexit. The
Regulations include provision for the reference above to “an EEA-regulated recognised stock exchange” to be
replaced upon the expiration of the transitional period with a reference to “a regulated recognised stock exchange”,
which term would include regulation by the U.K., such that this exemption should continue to apply in respect of
securities admitted to trading on the ISM after the expiration of the Brexit transitional period.

In other cases an amount may be withheld on account of income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.),
subject to any direction to the contrary by HM Revenue and Customs under an applicable double taxation treaty,
and except that the withholding obligation is disapplied in respect of payments to holders of Notes which the
Issuer reasonably believes are either a U.K. resident company or a non-U.K. resident company carrying on a trade
in the U.K. through a permanent establishment which brings into account the interest in computing its U.K. taxable
profits or are partnerships consisting of such persons (unless HM Revenue and Customs direct otherwise), or fall
within various categories enjoying a special tax status (including charities and pension funds).

Interest on the Notes may constitute U.K. source income for tax purposes and, as such, may be subject to U.K.
tax on income by direct assessment even where paid without withholding. However, interest with a U.K. source
received without deduction or withholding on account of U.K. tax will not be chargeable to U.K. tax in the hands
of a holder of Notes who is not resident for tax purposes in the U.K. unless that holder of Notes carries on a trade,
profession or vocation in the U.K. through a U.K. branch or agency or for holders who are companies through a
U.K. permanent establishment, in connection with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are
attributable. There are exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and
investment managers).

The reference to “interest” in this section means “interest” as understood in U.K. tax law, and in particular any
premium element of the redemption amount of any Notes redeemable at a premium may constitute a payment of
interest subject to the withholding tax provisions discussed above. The statements above do not take any account
of any different definition of “interest” which may prevail under any other law.

268


-----

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

Depending on the correct legal analysis of payments made by the Guarantors as a matter of U.K. tax law, it is
possible that payments by the Guarantors would be subject to withholding on account of U.K. tax, subject to any
applicable exemptions or reliefs (and noting that not all of the exemptions and reliefs set out above would
necessarily be applicable).

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

No U.K. stamp duty or SDRT is payable on issue of the Notes or on a transfer of the Notes.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect
to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This summary
applies only to U.S. Holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price
at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to persons other than bond houses, brokers or similar
persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who will
hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment). It does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this
summary does not address tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders that may be subject to special tax rules
including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies;
(iii) dealers or traders in securities or currencies; (iv) tax exempt entities; (v) persons who will hold the Notes as
part of a “hedging” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “synthetic security”
or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders who have a “functional
currency” other than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts; (viii)
partnerships and other pass-through entities or arrangements (and investors therein); and (ix) persons who have
ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States. Further, this summary does not
address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal
income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain
investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of
the Notes.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if (a) a court within the United States
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (b) the trust has validly elected to be treated as a
domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that holds the Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Prospective purchasers that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
them and their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes by the partnership.

This discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued with no more than a de minimis amount of original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This will be the case if the excess, if any, of the Notes’
stated principal amount over their issue price is less than 0.25% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied
by the number of complete years from the issue date to maturity. U.S. Holders of Notes issued with more than a
de minimis amount of OID generally will required to include such OID in income (as ordinary income) as it
accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of any cash attributable to such OID,
regardless of their regular method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders should
consult their own tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them if the
Notes are issued with OID.

This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and U.S. Treasury
regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.
All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax
consequences described below.

THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX
ADVISERS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING
AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE,
LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is
received or accrued, depending on such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Interest paid by the Company on the Notes will constitute income from sources outside the United States.

For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute “passive category” income, which
may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules governing foreign tax
credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability
of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances.

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and who receives a
payment of stated interest in euro (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest upon the
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Note) will be required to include in income the
U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the
payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time. A cash
basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income
but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro received.

A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will accrue stated
interest income in euro and translate that amount into U.S. dollars based on the average spot rate of exchange in
effect for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot
rate of exchange for the partial period within the applicable taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual method U.S.
Holder may elect to translate stated interest income received in euro into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of the interest accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of such partial accrual period) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day
of the interest accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that makes this
election must apply it consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot
change the election without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”).

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued euro-denominated stated interest income on the
date the interest payment (or proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition
attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) is actually received. The amount of foreign currency exchange
gain or loss recognized will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received
(determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received) in respect of the accrual
period and the U.S. dollar value of stated interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined
above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss
generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally
will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend
on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the
availability of foreign tax credits.

270


-----

**_Disposition of a Note_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition
(except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as
described above under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such Note,
determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (which generally should be the closing date). The
amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount
of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of
exchange on the date the Note is disposed of; provided, however, that if the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar
value of such foreign currency on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the
election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If a Note is not traded on an established securities market
(or, if a Note is so traded, but a U.S. Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the settlement date
election), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as
ordinary income or loss not treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense) to the extent that the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date) differs
from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized.

Except with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss discussed below, any gain or loss realized by a U.S.
Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital
gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of its disposition. For certain non-corporate
holders (including individuals), any such long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential
rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that
is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will generally be U.S. source ordinary income or loss not
treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price
for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note was acquired
(or, in each case, determined on the settlement date if the Notes are traded on an established securities market and
the holder is either a cash basis or an electing accrual basis holder). Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss
(including with respect to accrued interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized
by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

U.S. Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover certain
transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to
losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an individual or trust), such as the
receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency debt
instrument or of foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency debt instrument. Persons considering
the purchase of Notes should consult with their own tax advisers regarding the tax return disclosure obligations,
if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes or the disposition of euro received thereon, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Statement), including the significant penalties for
non-compliance with this requirement.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of sale or other disposition of the Notes paid, by a U.S.
paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required
under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide
an accurate taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.
Certain U.S. Holders (such as corporations) are not subject to backup withholding but may be required to provide

271


-----

certification of their exempt status. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle
such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Prospective
purchasers should consult their tax advisers about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply
to the ownership or disposition of the Notes.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain
minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form
8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign
financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions. Prospective purchasers are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding the possible
implications of these rules on their investment in the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**CERTAIN MALAYSIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**_Withholding tax_**

Under present Malaysian law, where a Malaysian resident is liable to make a payment of interest to a non-resident
of Malaysia, it shall deduct withholding tax at the prescribed rate from such payment and pay that tax to the
Director General of Inland Revenue within 1 month after such payment has been made or credited to the nonresident. If Synthomer Sdn Bhd (the “Malaysian Guarantor”) makes payment to a non-resident of Malaysia
under or with respect to its Guarantee which constitutes an interest income under the Income Tax Act 1967 of
Malaysia, such payment will be subject to withholding tax.

It is a term of the Guarantee that the Malaysian Guarantor shall, in the event of any such withholding, pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary to the holder of the Notes so as to ensure that the holder of the Notes
receive the full amount which they would have received had no such withholding been imposed.

**_Stamp duty_**

Malaysian stamp duty will be payable (i) on the Indenture executed by the Malaysian Guarantor at the fixed rate
of MYR2,000.00 and (ii) on each other document executed by the Malaysian Guarantor in connection with the
Notes and its Guarantee at the fixed rate of MYR10.00, within 30 days after it has been executed in Malaysia or,
if it is executed only outside Malaysia, within 30 days after it has been first received in Malaysia.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in some of the jurisdictions in_
_which the Issuer and each Guarantor are incorporated, and a summary of certain limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to_
_discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Notes and the_
_Guarantees. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain_
_matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply,_
_which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under_
_the Notes and the Guarantees. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with_
_respect to all such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of a Member State or Member States
of the European Union (in this section references to Member States relate to member states of the European Union
excluding Denmark), including Germany and Italy.

The EU Insolvency Regulation became fully effective on June 26, 2017, replacing the previous Council
Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court
requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to
Article 3. Article 3(1) provides that the court that has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation
to a company is the court of the Member State in which that company has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”).
The forms of insolvency proceedings that can comprise main proceedings are listed in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation and include, in respect of the U.K., administration, compulsory liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation with confirmation by the court (see “—Administration” and “—Liquidation/Winding Up”
below). The determination of where a company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Under paragraph 2 of Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place where its
registered office is located. This rebuttable presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved
to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of main insolvency
proceedings. The EU Insolvency Regulation specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption
of the COMI being at the place of the registered office may be rebutted if the company’s central administration is
located in a member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive
assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that
other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to
where a company conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the COMI, this may require
informing the creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in due course
(e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new
location public through other appropriate means).

The European Court of Justice has held that the presumption can only be rebutted if factors which are both
objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what a typical
third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that
the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004). Factors which may be taken into
account include the places where the company’s business is managed and operated, board meetings held and the
accounts prepared and audited.

Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its
registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption
cannot be rebutted (Interedil S.r.l. (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil S.r.l. and another C-396/09).

The point at which a company’s COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency
proceedings are opened—although note that there is a three month look back period as regards the presumption
of the company’s center of main interests.

273


-----

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in
other Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member State where
the company has an “establishment.” An establishment is defined in Article 2(10) as a place of operations where
a company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. This means a fixed place of business
and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal administration). The effect of secondary proceedings
is limited to the assets located in that Member State.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment shall
be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company
situated in the territory of such other Member State.

The EU Insolvency Regulation contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary
proceedings, as well as provisions dealing with insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies.

For guidance with respect to the U.K. leaving the European Union, please see below.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (the “English Guarantors”) are companies incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales. The Issuer’s and the English Guarantors’ registered offices are also located in England and
Wales. Assuming that their COMI is therefore in England and Wales (about which see further the section on “—
_European Union” above), jurisdiction for main insolvency proceedings under the EU Insolvency Regulation in_
respect of the Issuer and those Guarantors would be commenced in England and conducted in accordance with
the requirements of English insolvency law.

**_U.K. withdrawal from the European Union_**

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted in favor of withdrawing from the European Union in a national referendum and,
on March 29, 2017, the U.K. government exercised its right under Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union
to notify the European Union of the U.K.’s intention to withdraw from the European Union. The U.K. withdrew
from the European Union on January 31, 2020. As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the EU
Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the U.K. is to be read as a reference to such EU regulation, as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) (as amended
by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time
be amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from
time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

During a transitional “implementation period”, expected to end on December 31, 2020 (“IP Completion Day”)
(but subject to the possibility of an extension of up to two years), the U.K. will continue to be treated as an EU
member state in certain respects, including for the purpose of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Following IP
Completion Day, the U.K. will cease to be treated as an EU member state. The recognition of insolvency
proceedings in the U.K. by EU member states, and conversely of insolvency proceedings in EU member states by
the U.K., following the transition period will be subject to the outcome of negotiations between the European
Union and the U.K. during the implementation period. In the absence of an agreement addressing automatic
recognition of such procedures in particular, it will likely be harder for U.K. office holders and U.K. restructuring
and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in
those other EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international rules in the particular EU
member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In
particular, in cases where the appointment of a U.K. office holder has been made in reliance on a U.K. domestic
approach, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state even if U.K.
jurisdiction is taken on the grounds of U.K. COMI or establishment (where such concepts are retained as a matter
of U.K. domestic law).

274

**_Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006_**

The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “Model Law Regulations”) provide that the Model Law on
Cross-Border Insolvency as adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on 30 May
1997 has the force of law in Great Britain, subject to certain modifications.

The Model Law Regulations apply where (i) assistance is sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign
representative in connection with a foreign proceeding, or (ii) assistance is sought in a foreign state in connection
with a proceeding under British insolvency law, or (iii) a foreign proceeding and a proceeding under British
insolvency law in respect of the same company are taking place concurrently or (iv) creditors or other interested
parties in a foreign state have an interest in requesting the commencement of, or participating in, a proceeding
under British insolvency law.

The Model Law Regulations provide for the recognition of two types of foreign insolvency proceedings (defined
to be collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant
to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or
supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation): (i) “foreign main proceedings”,
which can be opened in the state in which the company has its COMI (which is subject to a rebuttable presumption
that the company’s registered office is the center of the company’s main interests and it should be noted that the
COMI for the purposes of the Model Law Regulations may be different from the COMI of an entity for the
purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and (ii) “foreign non-main proceedings”, which can be opened in the
state in which the company possesses an “establishment” (defined as any place of operations where the company
carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) but not a COMI.

A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis, authorized
in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the company’s assets or affairs or to
act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main proceeding or foreign non-main
proceeding is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British insolvency law (as defined in the Model
Law Regulations) if the conditions for commencing such a proceeding are otherwise met.

A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the foreign
representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time the application is
decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where relief is urgently needed to
protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature. Such relief
may include staying execution against the company’s assets, entrusting the administration or realization of all or
part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by
the court, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing
for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s
assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a
British insolvency officeholder (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) under the law of Great Britain,
including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended from
time to time) (the “IA86”).Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of
individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and
execution against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any right to take any steps to
enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of the company,
provided that such right would have been exercisable if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up
order under the IA86.

Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the assets of the
company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any
appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the commencement or continuation of individual
actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying
execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of
information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities, entrusting the
administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign

275


-----

representative or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously
granted and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under
the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86.

In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an
application to the court for an order under or in connection with sections 238, 239, 244, 245 and 423 of the IA86
(see below at “—Antecedent Transaction Laws”). For such purpose, certain time periods and notice periods
specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or
the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in the Model
Law Regulations. Where such an application is made, then those sections (together with ancillary sections of the
IA86 relating thereto) shall apply whether or not the company is being wound-up or is in administration under
British insolvency law.

Note that where the Model Law Regulations conflicts with an obligation of the U.K. under the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail. This means that, in practice, the Model
Law Regulations will be most relevant where the company has its COMI outside of the EU. It is possible, however,
that the Model Law Regulations could apply where a company has its COMI in the EU (but outside of the U.K.)
provided that there is no conflict with the EU Insolvency Regulation (for example, where main proceedings have
not yet been commenced in the place of the COMI or where the relief being sought in England under the Model
Law Regulations is not inconsistent with the automatic recognition provisions under the EU Insolvency
Regulation). Notwithstanding this, in respect of a company with its COMI in the EU (but outside of the U.K.) in
our view, a foreign insolvency officeholder is unlikely to make an application for recognition under the Model
Law Regulations rather than relying on automatic recognition of the relevant proceedings under the EU Insolvency
Regulation (and any application for recognition under the Model Law Regulations may conflict with the EU
Insolvency Regulation, in which case the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail).

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency _per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s_
‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, the
circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if
a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on
the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed to pay, secure or compound
the sum within 21 days of service; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to
pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**Administration**

Under English insolvency law, English courts are empowered to order the appointment of an administrator in
respect of an English company, a company with its COMI or an “establishment” (see “—Cross-Border Insolvency
_Regulations 2006” above) in England or indeed any company incorporated in an EEA state in certain_
circumstances and provided rules of private international law (including as to the entity’s connection to the
jurisdiction) are complied with. There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an
application to court followed by a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain
prescribed forms with the court following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The incourt route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more
of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential
Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons (note that it is possible to obtain an administration order
other than as listed above. For example, a foreign court in a state designated for the purposes of section 426 of the
IA86 may make a request to the English court for the English court to make an administration order in relation to
a foreign company. However, this is unusual). The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the
directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see further below for the
meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when
the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument
which (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating

276


-----

charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a
QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security
granted to that party which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property, and
at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the
security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no
statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or
out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts
(see “—The Insolvency Test” above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need
to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives
can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable
and similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result
for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration;
or (iii) to realize property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see “—Statutory
_Order of Priorities” below)._

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention
to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. The
moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or
continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s
property in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the court (although a demand
for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company), no administrative receiver can be
appointed, no resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited
circumstances, no order can be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to
financial collateral constituting a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”)
(generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable
capital market debt instruments and credit claims). Note that the Financial Collateral Regulations are secondary
legislation implementing EU Directive 2002/47/EC.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an
administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property
to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company
and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court
is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets; such permission will only be granted if disposing of the
property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and the proceeds of sale are paid to the fixed
charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where
appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions
(see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter). An administration does not itself terminate
any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts
(although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the
creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt – see “—Statutory Order
_of Priorities” below). Conversely, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination_
by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (such as administration) will generally be
enforceable as they are not considered to be against public policy as a matter of English law. However, there are
exceptions to this general approach, most notably in the context of contractual supplies of services that the
legislature has considered to be essential. As of 1 October 2015, counterparties may not terminate these contracts
(or the supplies they govern) simply because the company enters administration, except with the consent of the
administrator or the permission of the court.

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realized by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see “—
_Statutory Order of Priorities” below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed_
this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

277


-----

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”).

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its creditors
as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the
power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or
defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance
with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to
set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter).

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the
company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such
automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the
company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

_Compulsory Liquidation_

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor or one of the other parties set out
in section 124 of the IA86 (including the company itself or the directors of the company collectively) petitions for
the winding up of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to
make a winding up order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the
company is unable to pay its debts (see “—The Insolvency Test” above for the meaning of this term); and (ii) it is
just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares
and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement of a winding
up’ unless the court orders otherwise. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to
a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral
Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject
to certain exceptions, if a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced on the date on which the
winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning that any of the specified
transactions carried out after the presentation of a winding up petition will be void if a winding up order is
subsequently made unless the company (or an interested party) has first obtained a validation order from the court
(subject to such terms as the court may impose).

_Members’ Voluntary Liquidation_

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass
a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the majority of the directors must
swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they
have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts in full, including interest, within a stated period not
exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

_Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation_

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders passing a special resolution to place the company into liquidation
and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration
of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different
person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail unless any director, member or
creditor of the company successfully applies to the court for an order otherwise.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “CA06”) the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors
(or any class of its creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the IA86; and (ii) has

278


-----

“sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb
of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI
is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents
have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be
considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or
not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on a detailed debt compromise in
respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that
will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number
of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in favor of the proposed compromise,
irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will
(subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who
did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of
arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in
order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings. Note, however, that the U.K. Government intends to introduce a standalone moratorium as part of its corporate insolvency reform proposals. See “—U.K. Government Proposal for
_Changes” below._

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the IA86, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may
propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing
of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a
decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company
voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by
value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement.
However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the
company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

A company may take steps to obtain a moratorium once it intends to make a proposal for a company voluntary
arrangement, but the availability of such moratorium is limited to specifically defined small companies. Note that
the U.K. Government intends to repeal this process in the future and replace it with a new standalone moratorium.
See “—U.K. Government Proposal for Changes” below.

**_Statutory Order of Priorities_**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he or she
distributes the proceeds of realized assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realizations from assets subject
to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realization); (ii) expenses of the liquidation
or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or
liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (iii) ordinary preferential
debts, which include (but are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, employment
claims (up to a certain statutory maximum) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit; (iv) secondary preferential
debts, being bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the
claims exceed the statutory limit, and deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would
otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation (note that the U.K. Government has confirmed its intention
in the draft Finance Bill 2020 that from December 1, 2020 secondary preferential debts will include claims by

279


-----

HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI
contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI
contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers); (v) proceeds of floating
charge asset realizations (less any costs of realization, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (see below));
(vi) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination
agreements in place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in
each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant
insolvency proceedings; (vii) statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at the higher of the
applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838; and (viii) nonprovable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore
only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are
no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a
provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

The prescribed part is a ring-fenced amount of money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from
realizations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors (unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors), and is calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of the
company’s net property and 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, up to a maximum
aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder
of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is
£600,000).

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, any
debt of a company payable in a currency other than British pounds (such as euros in the case of the Notes) must
be converted into British pounds at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference
to the exchange rates prevailing at the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties.
If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that the Issuer or an English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders
of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such company goes into liquidation
or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

**_Post-Petition Interest_**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or any Guarantee to which an English
company is a party (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period
after the commencement of administration which has been converted into a distributing administration or after the
commencement of liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from any surplus remaining after payment
of all other debts proved in the English company’s insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to
the date of the commencement of those proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient
realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

**_Dispositions in Winding-Up_**

Under section 127 of the IA86, any dispositions of a company’s property made after a winding-up has commenced
is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. Subject to certain exceptions, the compulsory winding-up of a company
by the court is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented in respect of the company, rather than the
date on which the court makes the winding-up order (if any). However, this will not apply to any property or
security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the
Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance
with its terms.

280


-----

**_Trust Assets_**

Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available for
distribution.

**_Antecedent Transaction Laws_**

There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s
insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences
(section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors
(section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of
section 423 which applies regardless of whether the company is in insolvency proceedings. The granting of
security or guarantees by a company could be subject to challenge under these provisions.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration
order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date
on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court,
whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation
follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at
an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a
shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband,
wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has
control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the
other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same
persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of
either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118
of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the SBEEA) introduced section 246ZD to the IA86
from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including
the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction under section 238 of the IA86. Where (i) a foreign

281


-----

officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law Regulations and has successfully applied to the
court for an order under article 23 of Schedule 1 to the Model Law Regulations, or the court orders that a foreign
officeholder can take advantage of its provisions as a matter of general comity, or by the grant of assistance under
section 426 of the IA86 where that section applies, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction
at an undervalue.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a
transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration
the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth)
of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (within the
2 years before the onset of insolvency); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a
result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is
a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the
transaction is made to a connected person).

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company
which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and
(ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it
thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the
application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEA
introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may
assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any preference claim under
section 239 of the IA86. Where (i) a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law
Regulations and has successfully applied to the court for an order under article 23 of Schedule 1 to the Model Law
Regulations, or the court orders that a foreign officeholder can take advantage of its provisions as a matter of
general comity, or by the grant of assistance under section 426 of the IA86 where that section applies, he or she
also has standing to bring a preference claim.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered
something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the
event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have
been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a
desire to put the creditor in a better position than that person would have been in if the thing had not been done or
suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons, except where the creditor
is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee); (iv) the preference was given within the
relevant time (within the 6 months before the onset of the insolvency or within the 2 years before the onset of
insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the
transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of
the IA86.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of [the company’s]
insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd, 1993, BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be
foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial
considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon Ltd (No. 1),
_1990, BCLC 324). An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on,_
any person whether or not he or she is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for
value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit
from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company,
except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he or she was a
creditor of the company.

282


-----

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside by the court if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue
(see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person
who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing that person’s interests in
relation to the claim which that person is making or may make.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a
preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. The victim of the transaction (including the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator) can apply to court himself or herself (with the
leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator may also
apply for such as transaction to be set aside. Where (i) a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under
the Model Law Regulations and has successfully applied to the court for an order under article 23 of Schedule 1
to the Model Law Regulations, or the court orders that a foreign officeholder can take advantage of its provisions
as a matter of general comity, or by the grant of assistance under section 426 of the IA86 where that section
applies, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction defrauding creditors.

The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action (subject to the normal statutory
limitation periods). The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the
claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or
a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is
likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or
impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into.
However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than
the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require
a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of
the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted
recognition under the Model Law Regulations and has successfully applied to the court for an order under article
23 of Schedule 1 to the Model Law Regulations, or the court orders that a foreign officeholder can take advantage
of its provisions as a matter of general comity, or by the grant of assistance under section 426 of the IA86 where
that section applies, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for an extortionate credit transaction.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its
terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in
respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three
years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly
different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and
preferences).

**_Secondary Legislation_**

U.K. secondary legislation, such as the Financial Collateral Regulations, may be invalid and ineffective if, among
other things, it is not enacted within the scope of the relevant primary statute or within the powers of the relevant
rule-making authorities.

**_Corporate Authorizations and Maintenance of Capital_**

The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of a Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantees are
subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such
obligations: (A) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to which it is party); and (B) have
been duly authorized and do not breach or result in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the
documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable
procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of guarantees or security by an English company could be subject
to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the
extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the
legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including
guarantees and security).

**_Financial Assistance_**

A liability incurred directly or indirectly for the purpose of an acquisition (an “Acquisition Liability”) by any
person of shares in an English company or in any holding company (within the meaning contained in section 1159
of the CA06) of that company, or a liability incurred directly or indirectly for the purpose of the discharge or
reduction of any Acquisition Liability, could be subject to challenge if that incurrence, discharge or reduction is
unlawful under section 678 or 679 of the CA06. These provisions apply to financial assistance (which is wider
than monetary assistance and includes, for example, guarantees or security) granted in connection with an
acquisition of shares in an English company, if the English company providing the assistance is either a public
company the shares in which are being acquired, a public or private company that is a subsidiary of the public
company the shares in which are being acquired, or a public company that is a subsidiary of a private company
the shares in which are being acquired.

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action can only take effect as a legal assignment under section 136 of
the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must
be in writing and signed by the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of
charge only; (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor; and (iv) the rights to be
assigned must be wholly ascertainable and must not relate to only part of a debt, or other legal chose in action. If
any of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment if there
is a clear intention to assign. Equitable assignments are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation:
(i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the
holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most
equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or
to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first person to give notice will take priority, if that person
does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest.

**_Share Mortgages_**

A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if title to those shares is vested in the lender,
although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest.

284


-----

**_“People with Significant Control” Regime_**

Pursuant to Part 21A of the CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the CA06), from 6 April 2016 certain U.K.
incorporated companies, societates europaeae registered in the U.K. and limited liability partnerships formed
under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “relevant
**company”) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control**
over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and
Schedule 1B to) the CA06 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “notifying party”) to comply with the
requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying
party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the CA06. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice
is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the CA06, for
example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no
rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance
of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due
from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be subject
to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

**_Turnover Trust_**

A turnover trust may be construed as creating a registrable charge under section 859A of the CA06, in which case
it will be void in the circumstances set out in section 859H of the CA06, unless the prescribed statement of
particulars, together with a certified copy of the agreement or instrument under which the turnover trust arises,
are delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with section 859A of the CA06 within 21 days after
the date of creation of that charge (unless an order allowing an extended period is made under section 859F of the
CA06).

**_U.K. Government Proposal for Changes_**

On May 20, 2020, the U.K. Government published the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill (the “Bill”) to
introduce reforms to the existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been
proposed in August 2018 but were brought forward in response to COVID-19. The Bill is intended to be fast
tracked through the U.K. Parliament and subsequently enacted as the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act
(the “Proposed Act”). If enacted in its present form, the Proposed Act will affect the foregoing analysis and that
analysis should be read bearing in mind the factors outlined below and the passage of the draft legislation into law
in due course.

The measures include the following:

(a) Moratorium Proposal

The Proposed Act will introduce a new stand-alone moratorium to enable the company to reach an agreement
with its creditors and thereby facilitate company restructurings.

Subject to certain exclusions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the IA86 is eligible for the
moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including insurance and
securitization companies as well as parties to certain capital market arrangements), and any company which has
entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months. An
application for a moratorium must be accompanied by a statement from the directors of the company that, in their
view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts.

The U.K. Government intends that (unless the company is subject to an outstanding winding-up petition or is an
overseas company) entry into a moratorium will be similar to the current out-of-court administrator appointment
procedure (i.e. filing papers at court). A “moratorium monitor” (the “Monitor”) (an insolvency practitioner and
officer of the court) will provide a statement to the court confirming: (a) their consent to act; (b) that they have
assessed the company’s eligibility and that all moratorium qualifying conditions are satisfied; and (c) that it is
likely that a moratorium would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts (although
there are exemptions for certain debts including those which arise under certain financial services contracts,
including certain capital market arrangements). During a moratorium creditors are restricted from taking certain
enforcement measures including issuing legal proceedings and enforcing security without the leave of the court.
The Bill includes a carve-out for enforcement over security created under a financial collateral arrangement (see
“—Administration” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge which are permitted.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a
company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters administration or liquidation within a 12-week period
following the end of the moratorium, any unpaid moratorium debts and any pre-moratorium debts for which the
company did not have a payment holiday under the moratorium will have super-priority over any costs or claims
in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be
paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver), including the expense of those
later procedures.

The U.K. Government’s proposal allows the moratorium to last for an initial period of 20 business days, which
may be extended for a further 20 business days by the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from
the directors and the Monitor must be filed with the court confirming that the qualifying conditions continue to
be met. Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: (a) pursuant to an out-of-court filing for
a period of up to one year from commencement, if the requisite threshold of creditors consent (consent is only
required of creditors of pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has benefitted from a payment
holiday, and which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium); or (b)
pursuant to an in-court filing for such period as the court sees fit, where the requisite creditor consent is not
forthcoming. The required threshold for creditor approval will be met if more than 50% (by value) of secured and
more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless in both cases, more than
50% (by number) of unconnected secured and unsecured creditors vote against the extension.

286


-----

Where the Monitor concludes that a company no longer meets the qualifying conditions, the Monitor will be
required to bring the moratorium to an end by filing a notice with the court.

The existing small companies company voluntary arrangement moratorium (see “—Company Voluntary
_Arrangement” above) will be repealed when the Proposed Act comes into force._

Certain conditions of the moratorium may be relaxed during the first month following the enactment of the Bill.

(b) Ipso Facto Clauses to be Prohibited

The Bill introduces a prohibition on the enforcement of termination clauses by a supplier in contracts for goods
and services which are based on a formal insolvency procedure. There are wide exemptions for certain entities
and financial contracts including certain capital market arrangements.

(c) Restructuring Plan Proposal

The Proposed Act also provides for the creation of a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement
but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down (the “Restructuring Plan”).

This standalone restructuring option will be available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the
IA86, excluding: (a) certain financial market participants; and (b) any other company excluded by the Secretary
of State of the U.K. In addition, the company must: (a) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial
difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (b) have
proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members with the purpose of mitigating such financial
difficulties.

The process will closely resemble that of schemes of arrangement where a restructuring plan proposal will be sent
to creditors and shareholders and filed at court. The restructuring plan proposal has no financial eligibility criteria
and will therefore be available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan
would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner).

At a first “convening” hearing, the company or, if applicable, any creditor or shareholder of the company will
make an application to the court to order a meeting of the company’s creditors or shareholders, or a class of its
creditors or shareholders. The court will examine the classes of creditors and shareholders as defined by the
company and may order that “out-of-the-money” creditors and shareholders do not attend the meetings that are
convened. The Restructuring Plan proposal will then be voted on at the relevant creditors’ or members’ meeting.
The Restructuring Plan will be approved by the required majority if 75% by value of the creditors or shareholders,
or class of creditors or shareholders present, vote in favor of the Restructuring Plan. Following the creditors’ or
shareholders’ meeting, a second “sanction” hearing will be held at which the court will consider if the necessary
requirements have been met and will decide whether the restructuring plan is to be sanctioned and, as a result,
binding on affected creditors and shareholders. Necessary information about the Restructuring Plan proposal is
likely to be included in a form of explanatory statement (similar to that used in schemes of arrangement).

Where the Restructuring Plan is not approved by 75% by value of the creditors or shareholders, or class of
creditors or shareholders at the relevant meeting, the court nevertheless has the discretion to sanction the scheme,
and thereby “cram-down” dissenting classes of creditors or shareholders (as applicable) if: (a) the court is satisfied
that if the Restructuring Plan were sanctioned, no creditor or shareholder in the dissenting class would be worse
off than they would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario for the company if
the compromise or arrangement were not sanctioned; and (b) the restructuring plan has been agreed by a number
representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or shareholders who would receive a payment, or have a genuine
economic interest in the company, in the event of the most likely alternative scenario referred to in (a) above. A
restructuring plan will not be sanctioned where an application to the court is made within 12 weeks of a
moratorium coming to an end (see “Moratorium Proposal” above), and the proposal includes provision in respect
of any creditor with moratorium or pre-moratorium debts who has not agreed to that provision. Note also that a
restructuring plan cannot compromise aircraft related interests or liabilities given super-senior status as part of the
moratorium.

287


-----

A restructuring plan confirmed by the court will be binding on all affected parties. Parties’ rights following
confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished.
If a company subsequently entered an insolvency procedure after the failure of a restructuring plan, the rights and
claims of any creditors bound by the failed plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would
therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency.

(d) Suspension of existing insolvency provisions

The Proposed Act will provide for a temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions with retrospective effect
between March 1, 2020 a month after the Proposed Act comes into force. These provisions create an offence for
a director of a company that enters insolvent liquidation or administration to continue to trade when they knew or
ought to have known prior to the commencement of the insolvent liquidation or administration that there was no
reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation or administration.

The suspension of such measures is intended to protect directors from personal liability where they make decisions
to continue trading where the risk of insolvency as a result of COVID-19 is high. Other provisions aimed at
preventing director misconduct (such as fraudulent trading under Section 213 of the IA86) will continue to apply.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be
more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are
involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are
expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative
Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19,
2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency
matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter
_alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”)._
The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. _Ordinario_
no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt”
(fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial
liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same
procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency
proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings;
(v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to
favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency;
(vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain
provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The main provisions
set out in the Insolvency Code will only come into force 18 months after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale
(e.g., on August 15, 2020). Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact
on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the
near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein.

On April 8, 2020, the Italian Government approved the Law Decree No. 23/2020 (as amended by Italian Law No.
40/2020, the “Law Decree 23/2020”). The Law Decree 23/2020 came into force on April 9, 2020 and was

288


-----

approved in response to COVID-19 introducing a number of new measures to face the emergency. Amongst other
measures, Law Decree 23/2020 introduced the following provisions:

- Under Article 5 of the Law Decree 23/2020, the main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code will only
come into force on September 1, 2021 as opposed to August 15, 2020 as originally provided for therein.

- Under Article 10 of the Law Decree 23/2020, petitions for (i) insolvency under Article 15 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law; (ii) compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) under
Article 195 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; and (iii) commencement of extraordinary administration
procedure under Italian Law No. 270/1999, filed between March 9, 2020 and June 30, 2020 are
inadmissible (improcedibili). However such provision do not apply to petitions for insolvency filed under
the Italian Bankruptcy Law (i) by the debtor when the insolvency is not caused by consequence of the
COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) as a consequence, under certain circumstances, of the termination of the
procedure of a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo); and
(iii) by the public prosecutor together with the request of the application of precautionary or interim
protective measures or as a consequence of a criminal proceeding or certain other fraudulent activities.

Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may
be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts.
In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian
bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a law decree
containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree”). The Decree entered
into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by
Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the
_Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59_
of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of
December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy
legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) are to liquidate the debtor’s
assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in
case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have
often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along
with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to
promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially
distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer
able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary, status
of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard
the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent
insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy tools are available under Italian law for companies in a state of
crisis and for insolvent companies.

_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being
reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions,
and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent,

289


-----

but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors,
which may safeguard the existence of the company.

_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (Piani di risanamento) Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial
condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring
plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval
to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet
the requirement set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore,
no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring
arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any
protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or
acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to
certain conditions: (i) are not subject to clawback action; and (ii) are exempted from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed
(although publication in the companies’ register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow for certain
tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court
pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis_
_of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring
agreements, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must
assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the
agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within from the
following terms: (i) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which
are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case
of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation
of “financial distress” (i.e. facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process
and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting
from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative
or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain
any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not
expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can
therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the
sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or
postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant
to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are prending (i.e.
prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such
moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of
publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date
for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in

290


-----

relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for
anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may
be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and
sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the
expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same
time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to
the effect of the moratorium.

Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the
agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the
agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Decree No. 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of
the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are
entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at
least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement
binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to
certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other
available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations
and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the
remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed
down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the
lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria)
entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial
indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed
of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate in such negotiations in good faith, and (ii) an
independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests
similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The
purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed
bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial
creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors, _inter alia, the maintenance of the_
possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the granting of new facilities.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of nonfinancial creditors
(e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a
scheme.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the
approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders,
but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for
a debt restructuring agreement or a court- supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted
such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is
expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the
agreement or the approval of the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6,
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law

291


-----

(in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by
the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay
pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided
that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure
the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional
documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement
and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that
it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an
imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

_Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis, (i.e. financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business,
thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition
proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had
assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding
financial years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the
three preceding financial years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company
can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, a restructuring
plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of
the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for _concordato preventivo is then_
published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court
sanctions the _concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt_
became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all
enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand,
are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages
registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published
in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment
of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20%
of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated
companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt
securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging
to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for
a _concordato preventivo (so called_ _concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian_
Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013
(“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial statements from
the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within
a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of
a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts
such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further
verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and_
information duties of the company during the above-mentioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the
stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo
also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco).

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the _concordato preventivo_ having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial_
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors,
the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs
related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by
Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called _prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian_
Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back
action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary
petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed
within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same
proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the
debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these
cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as

293


-----

a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support
which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business
is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not
implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others,
the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge
(who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry
out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may
be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the
debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is
approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015
abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those
who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed
as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their
voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of
the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed
not to approve the _concordato preventivo_ proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the
_concordato proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to_
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to
vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato
_preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such_
value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their
debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the
court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to
other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors
or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the
court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely
to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals
or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate
claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in
case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the
unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation
of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a prebankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest
by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of
their claims.

294


-----

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special
powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking
all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law
132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant
to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s
assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to
the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the
creditors.

Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be
authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application_
for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the
procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not
exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an
indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification
would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting
creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public
prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor
when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. The bankruptcy is declared
by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding financial years; (ii)_
has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
financial years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, among other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
prescribed period;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and will rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured
creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the
sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision;

295


-----

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy
receiver (curatore fallimentare);

- any act (including payment, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) of the debtor done after (and in certain
cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those
made though the receiver, become ineffective against creditors;

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage
to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to
creditors; and

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration
are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of
the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one
of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors
as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The
liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets
include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing
for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority
of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that
priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be
recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law).
Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and
assets (if any) as below indicated.

_Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare)_

A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with
creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the
declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one
year following such declaration, but before the lapse of two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the
bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato_
_fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they_
will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an
independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among
the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims
are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the
claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required.

_Statutory Priorities_

The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that established
in the United States. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules of statutory priority by
proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination
principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in
intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent
they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of

296


-----

whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single
asset.

Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to
the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” claims (i.e. claims originated in the insolvency
proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims
of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority
claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including the claims of
the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining
priority claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in
payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari),
pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari).

_Avoidance Powers in Insolvency_

Similar to other jurisdictions, under Italian law, there are so-called “clawback” or avoidance provisions that may
lead to, _inter alia, the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the_
declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value,
preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors. Clawback rules under Italian
law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules
applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions.

Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back
period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes
between acts or transactions that are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions that are voidable at
the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

(a) _Acts Ineffective by Operation of Law_

(i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions
entered into for no consideration are ineffective as against creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity
in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is
ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate
by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to
wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge
the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and

(ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective as against creditors if made by the bankrupt
entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

(b) _Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner_

(i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and
be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

I. the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the
value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value
of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

II. payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration;

297


-----

III. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen due at the time when the
new security was granted; and

IV. pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency
declaration, in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the
new security was granted.

(ii) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified
below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the
non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

I. the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered
into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and

II. the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in the six
months preceding the insolvency declaration.

III. the following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

1. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

2. a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

3. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian
Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that
is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees
of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the
purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually
exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried
out therein;

4. transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a
plan (piano attestato) under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

5. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato
_preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione_
_del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

6. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work
carried out by them; and

7. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt
entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria)
provided for by the Italian Civil Code.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity
disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the
date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy
entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for
consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered

298


-----

into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design).
The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”
clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/
nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo_
_patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_
the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must
be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in
the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its
assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its
last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’
claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those
credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale)
to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial
receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of
Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the
procedure or place it into bankruptcy.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either
for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal
**Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless**
extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato).
The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s).
In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and
interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion
of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared
bankrupt.

**_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_**
**_insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative
phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry

299


-----

assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal
Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed
within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved
by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest
entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial
institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these
companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special
insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore)
is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato
_di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency_
proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced
administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for
example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to
existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.

**_Interim financing_**

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_
expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the
relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such
finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of
the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the
principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an expert_
certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided
for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

**_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_**

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain
transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five
years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Notes and any future
security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other
creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian

300


-----

Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor
made during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect
period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or
obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or
involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing
debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the
non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was
entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to preexisting debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s
insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations,
transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the
suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the
creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include
those contemplated by a Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the security documents by a
guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or
in connection with security interests under the relevant security documents may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any
amounts under the related security documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions,
all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered
into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**_Limitations on Granting Guarantees and Security Interests under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its laws (statuto sociale) and is subject
to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory
provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group
reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company granting a guarantee or a security interest must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange
for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate
benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by
case basis and its existence is a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any.

As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis,
although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company
belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for down-stream security interest or
guarantee (i.e., a security interest or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of directly or indirectly
owned subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of upstream or
cross-stream security interest or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of
the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the
laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest
or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or
advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian
grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In
particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream security or guarantee for the financial obligations of group
companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions
to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether

301


-----

and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The
general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to
the direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security
interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of
interest. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in
the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company
or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the
imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor
or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest
or the guarantee granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit
was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest
of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream and down-stream guarantees granted by
Italian companies.

In addition, the granting of a security or guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription
by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian
company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of
its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial
assistance provisions. Any loan, security or guarantee given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and
void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

In addition, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is
issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such
maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the
guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum
guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the Italian
guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If
such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the Guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

In any event, pursuant to and for the sole purposes of article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code and without prejudice
to the other limitations indicated below, the maximum amount, that an Italian guarantor may be required to pay
in respect of its obligations as a guarantor under its Guarantee, must be provided and, in the case at issue, such
cap is set at €720 million, representing 150% of the aggregate amount of the Notes.

In order to comply with corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under
the Indenture will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under
its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

In particular, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the amount recoverable from an
Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee will not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate maximum
amount of any intercompany loan or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt,
not including equity contributions) made available from time to time to that Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer and/or any other member
of the Group (whether directly or indirectly) out of the proceeds of the Notes (whether directly or indirectly) and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of such Guarantee. No Italian guarantor shall moreover be liable for
any amount in excess of the amount that such Italian guarantor is entitled to set off against its claims of recourse
or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee. The

302


-----

Indenture will additionally provide that financial indebtedness under the Notes the purpose or the actual use of
which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of an Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect
holding companies) and/or the subscription of any shares or quota in an Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or
indirect holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such
purposes) and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection
therewith shall not be guaranteed by the Guarantee given by the relevant Italian Guarantor.

However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts
under such Guarantees, as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior
indebtedness of such Guarantor. In addition, the proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees will be distributed
among the guaranteed creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under
the relevant Guarantees.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree of 1 September 1993, No. 385, as amended (the “Italian
**Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non**
compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among other things, entail the relevant guarantees
being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing
Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security by a
company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted
financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of
Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies that are under the control of the same entity. As a
result of the above-described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group
of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Trust_**

It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest or guarantee can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of
“trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and
powers of a “trustee” as agent or trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under
Italian law.

**_Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior
to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted
broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or
indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

303


-----

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any
of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes
is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any guarantees and/or
security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

The Law Decree 23/2020 introduced a temporary suspension of Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian
Civil Code. Specifically, under Article 8 of the Law Decree 23/2020, the provisions on the subordination of the
claims for the repayment of shareholders’ loans – and of the loans granted by any entity performing management
and coordination activity (attività di direzione e coordinamento) over the borrower - with respect to the claims of
the other creditors, will not be applicable to loans granted between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests and guarantees by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process
in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals
of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security
interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the
appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback
of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions
made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and
consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law
_Considerations—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)” above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or_
security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.
To the extent that the grant of any security interests or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have
a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interests, guarantee and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform
its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the
Italian Civil Code;

304


-----

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be
or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria)
and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public
policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal
concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive
such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- in general, under Italian law contracts can be declared null and void (nullo (Article 1418 of the Italian
Civil Code) or annullabile (Article 1425 of the Italian Civil Code));

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid,
not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save
those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code).Furthermore, contracts may be
terminated for breach (Article 1453 of the Italian Civil Code), supervening impediment (Article 1463 of
the Italian Civil Code) or excessive onerousness (Article 1467 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding
under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or
continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the
debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such
receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure or attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure
or attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover,

305


-----

to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date the
forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy proceedings
(Article 2788 of the Italian Civil Code). The same regime applies to priority rights depending on the legal
nature of the interest-producing receivables (privilegi; Article 2749 of the Italian Civil Code);

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data
_certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a_
document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one
of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document.
Furthermore, the requirement for an instrument of bearing an undisputable date (data certa) is requested
in order to oppose the instrument and the rights deriving thereby to a bankruptcy estate;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation guaranteed by an Italian company, which is
in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to
pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian
law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related
implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of
interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code,
according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover
the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months
based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as
a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing
enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

- in the case of the bankruptcy of the grantor of a pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the
pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and,
as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge
would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged
quotas or shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee,
security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets or, accordingly with the
circumstances of the case, from the date when the plaintiff could enforce his/her right, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a
declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act
that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

306


-----

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed
for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors (Synthomer Deutschland GmbH) is organized under the laws of Germany, has its registered
office in Germany and substantially all of its tangible assets are located in Germany. Consequently, any insolvency
proceedings with regard to this Guarantor are likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the Guarantor was held to
have its COMI within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would govern such proceedings. The
insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect
of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes and Guarantees,
as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Pursuant to the EU
Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the
European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in a
member state other than Germany (see—”European Union”). This is to be determined at the time when the
insolvency filing is made.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if
any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German
legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der
_Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly_
provides for coordination of insolvency proceedings of group companies and corporation between insolvency
courts and administrators. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the
insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of
claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German
Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be
competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency
administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on
insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency
administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, (preliminary) insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent
insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings (Antrag _auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). (Preliminary) insolvency proceedings_
must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung)
of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung),
a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values),
unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and the subsequent year (positive Fortführungsprognose). A debtor is_
illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it

307


-----

is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is
virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed
acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a
limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an
individual as personally liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the
management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three (3) weeks after the mandatory
insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, occurred. This three weeks period may however only
be utilized if and to the extent that the company’s management is still in promising negotiations for a restructuring
of the company. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as
well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments
obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period. However, only the debtor, but not a creditor, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings in that case.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the
Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the
“COVInsAG”), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until September 30, 2020. The
suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or there is
no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit¨ ). If the debtor was able to pay its debts
on December 31, 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)—it is assumed that the insolvency
was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that there are prospects of remedying an existing
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’
insolvency filings in the period from March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 can only be opened if the event of illiquidity
or over-indebtedness already existed on March 1, 2020. However, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer
Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the suspensions until March 31, 2021 if this appears to be
necessary due to the continuing demand for available public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other
circumstances. The COVInsAG also provides for a relief from claw-back for the satisfaction of claims or the
provision of collateral for these claims, which the creditor was entitled to receive and which are made so long as
the suspensions apply, and unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor
were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court
will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the
debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the
debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no circumstances are known which lead to the expectation
that debtor-in-possession status will place the creditors at a disadvantage.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the insolvency court if the debtor satisfies at least two of the_
following three requirements:

- a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

- revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding
the filing; and/or

- 50 or more employees on an annual average basis.

308


-----

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other
group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions
taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the
selection of a (preliminary) insolvency administrator or (preliminary) custodian and orders for (preliminary)
debtor-in-possession status.

In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual as (preliminary)
insolvency administrator, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible;
_i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests_
of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one
for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the
preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which
may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency
reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to_
cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient,
the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will
be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the
same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a
debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right
to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual
appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and_
amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator
and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and
impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to
continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as
preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an
unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the
available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the
German insolvency regime would be the following:

- unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of the assets of the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

- unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Guarantor or
any of its relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the Guarantor or such
subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

- If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor
in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part
of the Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings;

- claims against the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with
the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

309


-----

- all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings
and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims during the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions under the German
Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is
subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court,
with respect to assets other than real estate also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed
and the time when insolvency proceedings commence).

If a German Guarantor, having its center of main interests within the territory of Germany, grants security over
its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of
such other creditors’ secured claims with respect to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant
collateral in insolvency proceedings upon the estate of the German subsidiary. In contrast, the claims of the holders
of the Notes under a Guarantee granted by the German Guarantor would be qualified as an unsecured insolvency
claim in the German Guarantor’s insolvency. Whether and to what extent a dividend can be distributed to the
unsecured insolvency creditors (such as the holder of the Notes) depends on the size of the insolvency estate and
the amount of the claims registered within the list of creditors. In addition, it may take several years until an
insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors (whereas advanced distributions to the secured
creditors are generally allowed). Alternatively, a different distribution of enforcement proceeds and/or the
insolvency estate could be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that may be submitted by the relevant
debtor or the relevant insolvency administrator. Such insolvency plan may provide for measures deviating from
regular insolvency proceedings in terms of conducting the procedure as well as realization and distribution of the
insolvency estate.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law.
This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Powers of attorney granted by the
relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings.

Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute
part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must
be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) or are preferred
creditors (Massegläubiger)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—in
principle—subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by
a court, also during preliminary insolvency proceedings). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient
assets are available).

German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability of secured creditors with preferential rights to
enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator
will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the
initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type
of security.

Thus, the insolvency administrator in particular has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its
possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and
rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as (ii) to collect any
claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is

310


-----

vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i)
assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets
(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT
(if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims.

Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan.
However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it
by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the
debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which
has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of
authoritative case law, it is currently uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement
process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency
estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of
the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds.
Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant
debtor for the return of funds or the payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor
of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of
regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige
_Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the_
unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated
_Claims.”_

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ assets
will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going
concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Guarantor or any of its relevant
subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval
of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—
be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership
rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including
a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or overindebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can
prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant
a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this
period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under
these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The
debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the
insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously
not competent or impartial).

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession status, the
custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are detrimental to insolvency
creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable
claw-back periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency
administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will
have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, the Guarantor or any
of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts

311


-----

to the holders of the Notes (including under a Guarantee) as well as the granting of collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an
insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes,
may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been made under the
Notes or a Guarantee, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured
claim under the Notes or a Guarantee, without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of
a Guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be
voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act was taken (i) during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
at such time or (iii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental
to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such
detrimental effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (or of circumstances that
compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the
debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction (or had knowledge of circumstances
that compellingly suggest filing);

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a thirdparty debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing
its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of
such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge
by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact

312


-----

that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a
presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party of the debtor that
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded
earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the
contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions
that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who
are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

- any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition; or

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was
liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the
debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case
may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor,
or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction
(kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the
preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency
creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred
payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency
creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to an “affiliated
party” of the debtor, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may
as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
(Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party financing
(i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder
loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest
payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020
and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the
provision of collateral in favour of third-party financing providers during the suspension period, but does not
apply in case of the provision of collateral in favour of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar
acts.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security

313


-----

right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The
prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from
the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in the near future. On June 20, 2019, the
Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Restructuring Directive”) has been
adopted. The member states have two years to transpose the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into
their national legislation, a one-year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place
key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and measures to make all types of
insolvency procedures more efficient. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a
preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum standards to be applied by the
member states (i.e., minimum harmonization) but leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation
of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which
claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not
more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the
voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings.
The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cram-down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting
on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan
might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides
for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the
Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below
the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts
if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors
from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors
due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a
shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and
receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for
newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 where the debtor
fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

The granting of guarantees by the German Guarantor will be subject to certain German capital maintenance rules
of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (the “GmbHG”) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a_
German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—a “GmbH”) or a German limited
partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a “GmbH & Co. KG”). As a general
rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability
reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the amount
of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced.
Guarantees and any collateral granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct
or indirect parent or affiliate of a (direct or indirect) shareholder are considered disbursements under Sections 30
and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or affiliate of a (direct or indirect) shareholder without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and
to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements,
indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries
incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation

314


-----

language”, the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to (subject to certain exemptions) enforce the
guarantees against the German subsidiary only if (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable if)
and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in
the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Guarantees by the Guarantor under the Indenture, will
contain such contractual limitation language and such Guarantees will be limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the Guarantees by the Guarantor cannot be enforced at all or the holders of the
Notes would have to release such enforcement proceeds.

Further, section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG restricts payments if and to the extent such payments under any Guarantee
would deprive the German Guarantor of the liquidity necessary to fulfill its financial liabilities to its (other)
creditors.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings
may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German Guarantor constituted in the form of a
GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes
or of the German Guarantor to make payments on the related Guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a
shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied
by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount
of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and
anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting
of guarantees by the German Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of
the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for
example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors
of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present
if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee
and/or collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

During the suspension of filing obligations as set out above, the COVInsAG also provides for a relief from lender
liability, as any new loans or the provision of collateral for such loans is not regarded against bonos mores. This
relief shall include deferrals and “amend & extend” transactions. See also “—Insolvency.”

The corporate insolvency regime in Malaysia is mainly governed by the Companies Act 2016 of Malaysia (“CA
**2016”), which came into force in stages from 31 January 2017, replacing the previous Companies Act 1965 after**
51 years. The main corporate insolvency processes or restructuring processes in Malaysia includes schemes of
arrangement, corporate voluntary arrangement, judicial management and liquidation/winding up.

_Winding Up_

Under the CA2016, the court can wind up a company on a number of grounds, for example, where the company
is unable to pay its debts, where the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in the directors’ own interest
rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or have acted in any other manner which appears to be unfair
or unjust to members, or where the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound
up. If a winding-up order is made, the court will appoint a liquidator to oversee the liquidation process. Any
disposition of property, including any transfer of shares, alteration in the status of the members of the company,

315


-----

or any attachment, sequestration, distress or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company
after the commencement of winding-up is void, unless the court orders otherwise.

A voluntary winding-up can either be a members’ or creditors’ winding-up. In a members’ winding-up, the
shareholders can voluntarily wind up their own company if the company is solvent. First, the directors of the
company must make a statutory declaration in the prescribed form that the company is solvent and that it will be
able to pay its debts in full for the next 12 months following the commencement of winding-up. Directors of the
company must have reasonable grounds on which to base their declaration. Following the declaration of solvency,
an extraordinary general meeting is convened to enable the shareholders to pass a special resolution to wind up
the company. The shareholders will appoint a liquidator at this meeting. Once a liquidator is appointed, the
directors’ powers will cease and any transfer of shares or any alteration in the status of members will be void.
Once all these steps have been taken, the company must cease to carry on its business (except where the liquidator
is of the opinion that continuing activities will benefit the winding-up).

If the liquidator subsequently discovers that the company is insolvent, the liquidator must convert the members’
voluntary winding-up into a creditors’ winding-up.

In a creditors’ winding-up, an extraordinary general meeting of the company’s members must be called, followed
by a special creditors’ meeting to formalise the liquidation and the choice of liquidator. The creditors have the
option of replacing the liquidator appointed by the shareholders during the earlier phase. After this:

- Business activities must cease.

- The directors’ powers to control the company cease.

- Any transfer of shares or any alteration in the status of members or any attachment, sequestration, distress
or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of
creditors’ winding-up is void.

- No action or proceedings shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company after the
commencement of the creditors’ winding-up of the company except by with approval of the court.

_Unsecured Creditor Rights, Remedies and Priorities_

The CA 2016 does not provide specific rights and remedies for unsecured creditors. However, unsecured creditors
who have the right to vote might be able to disrupt the restructuring process, as any proposal made will only be
binding on all creditors after obtaining a majority of 75% in value of the creditors.

An unsecured creditor has to prove his or her debt. An unsecured creditor will only be paid after the secured
creditors and preferential creditors’ debts have been fully settled.

The time-limit to commence a legal action against a debtor in any matters relating to any forms of contract is
generally six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued, i.e., the date on which the money is due
for payment. When a judgment has been obtained, the judgment creditor has 12 years from the date that the
judgment became enforceable to enforce the judgment and no arrears of interests in respect of the judgement debt
shall be recovered after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the interests became due.

_Scheme of Arrangement_

A scheme of arrangement is a court-approved compromise or arrangement that may be initiated by the company,
any creditor or member of the company, liquidator (if the company is being wound up) or the judicial manager (if
the company is under judicial management). The initiator will apply to the court for an order for meeting of the
creditors or members to be held. Only a proposed compromise or arrangement that has been agreed by 75% of the
total value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and voting either in person
or by proxy at the meeting and approved by the court will be binding on all the creditors, members of the company,
the company or the liquidator and contributories (if the company is being wound up).

When a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors or any class of
those creditors, the court may, on application by the company or any member or creditor of the company, restrain

316


-----

further proceedings in any action or proceedings against the company except by leave of the court. The restraining
order granted under Section 368(1) of the CA 2016 may be extended for a period of not more than 9 months if the
conditions in Section 368(2) of the CA 2016 are fulfilled.

In a scheme of arrangement, the directors and officers of the company will continue to manage the company.
However, any disposition or acquisition of property made after the grant of the restraining order of the court, other
than in the ordinary course of business of the company, without leave of the court, shall be void and the company
and every officer which does so shall be guilty of an offence. Whilst the directors are not prevented from
continuing the operation of business and creating further indebtedness in a scheme of arrangement, in the event
that the company goes into liquidation, the directors will be liable if they contracted to a debt without reasonable
expectation that the company will be able to pay the debt.

_Corporate Voluntary Arrangement_

A corporate voluntary arrangement (“CVA”) is a mechanism that involves minimal court intervention and is only
applicable to a private company that does not have charges created over its property or any of its undertakings.
Persons who may propose a voluntary arrangement are the directors of a company, the judicial manager (if the
company is under a judicial management order (“JMO”)) or liquidator (if the company is being wound up). In a
CVA, the directors and officers of the company will continue to manage the company subject to the moratorium
that commences automatically upon filing the requisite documents. The moratorium shall remain in force for 28
days but may be extended for up to 60 days. During this period, no petition may be presented for the winding-up
of the company, no application for JMO may be made against the company, no judicial manager of the company
may be appointed, no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process may be commenced or continued
and no distress may be levied, against the company or its property except with the approval of the court.

Similar to a scheme of arrangement, there are no provisions prohibiting the directors from continuing the operation
of business and create further indebtedness, however, in the event the company goes into liquidation the directors
will be liable if they contracted to a debt without reasonable expectation that the company will be able to pay the
debt.

_Judicial Management_

The judicial management is a new corporate rescue mechanism that only came into force on 1 March 2018. An
application for the appointment of a judicial manager may be made jointly or separately by (i) a company under
a resolution of its members of the board of directors; or (ii) a creditor, including any contingent or prospective
creditor. An applicant must nominate an insolvency practitioner, who is not the auditor of the company, to act as
the judicial manager.

The court will only make a JMO in relation to a company that has not gone into liquidation and if the court is
satisfied that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts and the JMO will be likely to achieve one or more
of the purposes as listed in Section 405(1)(b) of the CA 2016, namely: (i) the survival of the company, or the
whole or part of its undertaking as a going concern; (ii) the approval of a compromise or arrangement under
Section 366 of the CA 2016 between the company and any such persons mentioned in the section; or (iii) a more
advantageous realization of the company assets than would be effected by a winding-up.

Upon the appointment of a judicial manager pursuant to a JMO, any receiver or receiver and manager shall vacate
the office and any winding-up application shall be dismissed. The powers conferred and duties imposed on the
board of the directors shall be exercised by the judicial manager upon his or her appointment.

A JMO shall remain in force for 6 months but may be extended for another 6 month period. During such period,
no resolution shall be passed or order made for the winding up of the company, no receiver or receiver and
manager shall be appointed, no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process shall be commenced or
continued and no distress may be levied against the company or its property except with the consent of the judicial
manager or with the leave of the Court. In addition, no steps shall be taken to transfer any share of the company
or to alter the status of any member of the company except with the consent of the judicial manager or with the
leave of the Court

317


-----

In addition, any transfer, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against the
company from the company’s own money in favor of any creditor or any person in trust of any creditor with the
intention to give such creditor a preference over other creditors shall be void in the event of the company being
placed under judicial management on an application for a JMO presented within 6 months from the date of making,
taking, paying or suffering the transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution and every such act.
However, this does not affect the rights of any person making title in good faith and for valuable consideration
through or under a creditor of the company placed under the judicial management.

**_Limitations on Granting of Guarantees_**

The fundamental principle underlying the issue of corporate benefit is that directors must exercise their powers in
the best interest of the company. The duties and liabilities of officers of a company are now codified in Section
213 of the CA 2016. When acting in the interest of the company, a director must exercise his powers for a proper
purpose and in good faith (Section 213(1) of the CA 2016). Therefore, if a director acts in good faith in the best
interest of the company but for a collateral purpose, he would be in contravention of Section 213(1) of the CA
2016 and shall on conviction be liable to be imprisoned for five years or subject to a fine not exceeding MYR3
million or to both.

Ultimately, it is a question of fact as to whether a transaction has commercial benefit for a company. In practice,
resolutions of the directors should set out in detail the commercial benefit that the company will derive from
entering into a particular transaction.

In addition, no Malaysian company shall provide any financial assistance, whether directly or indirectly and
whether by means of a loan, guarantee or the provision of security or otherwise, for the purpose of or in connection
with a purchase or a subscription made or to be made of or for any shares in the Malaysian company or in the case
where the Malaysian company is a subsidiary, any shares in its holding company or in any way purchase, deal in
or lend money on its own shares. A Malaysian company is also not allowed to give guarantee in connection with
a loan made to any persons connected with its director or a director of its holding company (including issuance of
bonds by such persons), unless, inter alia, the relationship between the guarantor and the borrower or issuer is that
of holding company and subsidiary or subsidiary of a holding company.

**_Undue Preference_**

Under Section 528 of the CA 2016, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other acts
relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as the debts become
due, from its own money in favor of any creditor or person in trust for any creditor, will be deemed fraudulent
and void, if the company is presented with a winding up petition within 6 months from the date of such transfer,
delivery, payment or act, unless the transfer, delivery, payment or act is in favor of any person dealing with the
company for valuable consideration and without any actual notice of the company’s inability to pay its debts or
any winding-up proceedings against the company.

**_Foreign Exchange Policy Considerations_**

The Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) (“BNM”) imposes certain exchange control restrictions
on the granting of guarantees. These restrictions are provided for in Foreign Exchange Notices issued by BNM
on 30 April 2020, which includes a restriction on giving of guarantee by a non-bank resident of Malaysia to secure
a borrowing (a) obtained by a non-resident of Malaysia which is a special purpose vehicle, or (b) where the
resident guarantor has entered into a formal or informal arrangement to make repayment of the borrowing in
foreign currency other than for an event of default. The obligations of the Malaysian Guarantor under its Guarantee
shall not take effect until and unless the prior written approval has been obtained from BNM and is in full force
and effect.

As BNM’s prior written has been obtained for the Malaysian Guarantor to provide its Guarantee, no further
approval will be required from BNM or any other Malaysian regulator for the repatriation of the enforcement
proceeds in foreign currency out of Malaysia. However, the guarantor will need to notify BNM in the event the
guarantee is called upon within a specified period. There is no limit on the amount of proceeds that may be
repatriated at any time under such circumstances, but the proceeds must be converted to foreign currency before
the repatriation is made.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Citigroup Global Markets Limited, HSBC Bank Plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Banco Santander, S.A. are the Initial
Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”),to
be entered into in connection with the Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and each of the
Initial Purchasers has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer the principal amount
of Notes set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are
purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of
the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them,
subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes, and other conditions
contained in the Purchase Agreement, such as the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of officer’s certificates and
legal opinions. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the
Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed
that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to QIBs within the meaning of Rule 144A; and
(ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S. Any
offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are
registered as such under the Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or
sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not it is participating in the Offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them
by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that, except as permitted by the Purchase Agreement, it will not offer, sell or
deliver the Notes, (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise within the United States and that it
will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Notes a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the Notes within the United States. Terms used in this paragraph and not defined in this Offering
Memorandum shall have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each of the manufacturers, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the U.K., by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit
a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any
other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly,
the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees

319


-----

may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable
rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer
to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves
about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed, that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and
will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United
Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more)
of the following:

i. a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID
**II”); or**

ii. a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point**
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the U.K., those Regulations or Directives as they
form part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented
in U.K. domestic law, as appropriate.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer does not intend to apply
for listing of the Notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer
quotation system.

Application has been made to list the Notes on the London Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the London
Stock Exchange’s ISM. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that
such listing will be maintained. The Issuer cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the
market after this Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the
Notes will continue after this Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make
a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making
activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject
to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act and may be limited. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that
you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be
favorable.

**Settlement Cycle**

We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the       business day following the date of pricing
of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+      ”) Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this
Offering Memorandum or the next       business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will

320


-----

settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not during the period from the date of this Offering
Memorandum and including the date that is 45 days after such date, without first obtaining the prior written
consent of the Initial Purchasers, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities issued or
guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having a tenor more than one year.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager or one or more of its affiliates (or persons acting on their
behalf) may over-allot the Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes
during the stabilization period at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilization
may not necessarily occur. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public
disclosure of the final terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may cease at any time, but must end
no later than 30 days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the issue, or no later than and 60
days after the date of allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over allotment must be conducted by the
Stabilizing Manager (or person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) in accordance with all applicable
laws and regulations and will be undertaken at the offices of the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on their
behalf) and on the ISM of the London Stock Exchange.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required
to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the Notes in
the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there
may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the
representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and/or may in the future engage in,
investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, treasury management, transaction and clearing
services, fleet leasing facilities, corporate pension management, broking, consulting and financial advisory
services and/or other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer or its affiliates for
which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement. In addition, in the
ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad
array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments
and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates (including
the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its
subsidiaries may routinely hedge their credit exposure to these entities consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
securities (including potentially, the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices

321


-----

of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
Furthermore, each of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers,
bookrunners and original lenders, and HSBC Bank plc is agent, in each case, under the Bridge Facilities
Agreement and the 2019 Syndicated Facilities Agreement and therefore each will receive a portion of the proceeds
from the Offering in connection with the repayment of the Bridge Facilities.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, or the securities
laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, therefore unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons, except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act or the
securities laws of such state or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and
sold only to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in Rule 144A in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (and only to investors who, if resident in a Member State of
the EEA or in the United Kingdom, are not retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II).

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the Securities Act and, therefore,
the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Issuer is offering
and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States to QIBs, in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- to investors who are non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transaction in accordance
with Regulation S.

The terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” are used with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, an offer or sale
of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A.

By your acceptance thereof, you will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer
and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

1. You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A, and, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) below.

2. You are not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or acting on behalf
of the Issuer and you are either:

(i) a QIB and are aware that any sale of Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and the
acquisition of Notes will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(ii) a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes (including the Guarantees) outside the United States in an
offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S; or

(iii) if resident in a Member State of the EEA or in the United Kingdom, it is not a retail investor.

3. You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of
the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum

323


-----

has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect
to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering
Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as
you have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

4. You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which you are
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to your or their ability to
resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available
under the Securities Act.

5. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the Notes,
and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or
otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the
case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Notes, the original
issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates was the owner of
such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) or, in the case of the Regulation S Notes, 40 days after the later of
the original issue date of such Notes (or, if later, the issue date of any additional Notes) and the last date on
which the Notes were first offered to persons other than “distributors” (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation
S), only (i) to the Issuer; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the
Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you
reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The following is a summary of service of process and enforcement of judgments in some of the jurisdictions in_
_which the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized. The description is only a summary and does_
_not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the ability to serve_
_process and enforce judgments with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees. Prospective investors in the Notes_
_should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

The Issuer is a public company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Guarantors are privately
held companies organized outside of the United States. Future guarantors may be organized under the laws of
non-U.S. jurisdictions.

All of the Issuer’s directors and executive officers and all of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are nonresidents of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within
the United States upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or their respective directors, officers and other executives or
to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or
state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer has appointed, or will
appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York.

In addition, as many of the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s assets and the assets of their respective directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or U.S.
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or the Guarantors, investors will need to
enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets.

**England and Wales**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and Wales
is based upon advice provided to the Group by our English legal advisors. The U.S. and the U.K. currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment of a U.S. federal or state court, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, will not automatically be recognized or directly
enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings
must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, the English
court would not generally re-investigate the merits of a final and conclusive judgment of the U.S. court (subject
to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim
(assuming that there is no real prospect of a successful defense to it).

Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court is conditional upon (among other things)
the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of the
conflict of laws and private international law;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or being in breach of English principles of natural
or substantial justice;

- the U.S. judgment establishing a debt or being for a definite sum of money (provided that the judgment
is not for a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or
fine or other penalty, or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal,
revenue or other public law);

- recognition of the U.S. judgment not being contrary to public policy;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment not violating the Human Rights Act 1998;

328


-----

- the U.S. judgment (i) is not a judgment in respect of the same subject matter involving the same parties
that has previously been determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to
recognition in England and Wales; and (ii) does not conflict with an earlier judgment of such court in
respect of the same subject matter involving the same parties;

- the U.S. judgment was not given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for the settlement of
disputes;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would not contravene the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980
(particularly Section 5 which precludes, among other things, the enforcement in the United Kingdom of
any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages arrived
at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage
sustained); and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

In addition, an English court may decline to accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was
commenced in England and Wales and was predicated solely upon a law other than the law of England and Wales.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales.

**Germany**

One of the Guarantors is organized under the laws of Germany (the “German Guarantor”). None of the directors,
officers or other executives of the German Guarantor are residents or citizens of the United States. Therefore, you
may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, officers or executives.
Furthermore, since the assets of the German Guarantor, and its respective directors and officers are located outside
the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the German Guarantor or any such other
person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes
or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a
judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Germany.

As a general rule, a final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, for the payment of a specific sum of money
based on civil matters, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. court, unless

- the courts of the jurisdiction where the relevant court is located did not have jurisdiction according to the
principles on jurisdictional competence under German law;

- the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant
was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient time
and in such a way to enable him to arrange for his defense, unless the defendant failed to commence
proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for the defendant; a method of service of
process agreed upon may not be regarded as due service if such method is contrary to the applicable law
(including any international treaty) on service for the proceedings;

329


-----

- the judgment is irreconcilable with (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a
German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is
to be recognized in Germany or (iii) the procedure leading to the respective judgment being irreconcilable
with a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

- such recognition entails results which are obviously irreconcilable with fundamental principles of
German law, including without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany
(Grundrechte); or

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having
received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Even if
a U.S. judgment is recognized in Germany, it does not necessarily mean that it will be enforced under all
circumstances. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement
procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign
judgment became res judicata, a defense against enforcement may arise. Enforcement and foreclosure based on
U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a
competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able
to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.
However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect
of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws,
provisions or circumstances affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany,
such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the relevant Guarantor or such
persons will be, basically, regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which
such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re- hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line
with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. If however a judgment must be
recognized under the German Code of Civil Procedure (see above), a German court has to deliver its judgment in
accordance with the findings of the final judgment by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts
as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to
compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to
the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process
exists under German law.

**Malaysia**

Substantially all of the assets of the Malaysian Guarantor are located outside the United States. In addition, all of
the directors and executive officers of the Malaysian Guarantor are not residents or citizens in the United States
and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are not located in the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within United States upon such persons or to enforce
judgments obtained in courts within United States, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, against such persons or the Malaysian Guarantor.
We have been advised by our Malaysian counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Malaysian courts,
in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities
predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States.

330


-----

Under current Malaysian law, any judgment obtained for a fixed sum against the Malaysian Guarantor in a court
of a foreign jurisdiction with which Malaysia has no arrangement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments, after
due service of process, may, at the discretion of the courts of Malaysia be actionable in the courts of Malaysia by
way of a suit on a debt if such judgement is final and conclusive and so long as the judgement:

(a) is not inconsistent with public policy in Malaysia;

(b) was not given or obtained by fraud or duress or in a manner contrary to natural justice;

(c) is not directly or indirectly for the payment of taxes or other charges of a like nature or of a fine or other
penalty;

(d) was of a court of competent jurisdiction of such jurisdiction and the judgment debtor being the defendant
in the original court received notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable it to defend the
proceedings;

(e) has not been wholly satisfied;

(f) could be enforced by execution in the country of that original court;

(g) is final and conclusive between the parties;

(h) is for a fixed sum;

(i) is not directly or indirectly intended to enforce the penal laws or sanctions imposed by the authorities of
such jurisdiction;

(j) is not preceded by a final and conclusive judgment by a court having jurisdiction in that matter; and

(k) is a judgement where the rights thereunder are vested in the person by whom the suit in the Malaysian
courts based on the foreign judgment was filed.

There is currently no agreement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments between Malaysia and New York, and
as such, if a New York court were to rule in an investor’s favor, it may be difficult to enforce such judgments in
Malaysia. Due to the absence of reciprocal arrangements, judgments obtained in a New York court will only be
enforced in Malaysia in accordance with the common law principles and fresh proceedings must be instituted in
Malaysia by the judgment creditor and upon re-litigation and re-examination of the issues

**Italy**

Certain Guarantors are organized or incorporated (as applicable) under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the
“Italian Guarantors”). Substantially all of our directors and executive officers and of each of the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Substantially all of our assets and each of the Guarantors, and our and their
directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the
United States against us or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment
of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil
liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore,
although we and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will
submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service
of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including
actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors
to effect service of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons mentioned above
provided that, for example, the requirements of The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 are complied with. If a judgment
is obtained in a U.S. court against us, any Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets.
Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for Italy, you

331


-----

should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those
countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The United States and Italy do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Since two Guarantors are domiciled in Italy in case a judgement is
obtained in a U.S. court against such Italian Guarantors, investors will need to enforce such judgment in
jurisdictions where the relevant companies have their assets (i.e. in the case of the Italian Guarantors, most likely,
in Italy).

We have been advised by counsel in Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered by a U.S.
federal or New York state court, even if obtained by default, in Italy is governed by Article 64 of the Private
International Law Act (i.e. Law 218 of May 31, 1995, _Riforma del Sistema Italiano di diritto internazionale_
_privato) (the “PIL Act”) (and certain other provisions of the PIL Act)._

Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court, even if obtained by
default, can be recognized in Italy without re-examination of the merits of the case provided that the following
requirements are met:

- the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment upon the
matter (in accordance with the Italian rules on jurisdiction);

- the defendant had appropriately been served the relevant summons and complaints in accordance with
the laws of the state in which the proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived
of his/her essential rights;

- the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the
proceedings were conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local procedural law;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is final, not subject to any further
appeal in accordance with U.S. law and binding (passato in giudicato) according to the law of the state
in which it was issued;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any final and
binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

- there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and between
the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the relevant U.S.
federal or New York state court; and

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public policy
(ordine pubblico).

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding
must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to this end. The competent Court of Appeal does not
consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above
(including that requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary
to public policy in Italy).

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the
U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court
may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought
(e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of
Italian law.

**Notes to the interim financial statements**

**1. Basis of preparation**

Synthomer plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the
Companies Act. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the address of the registered
office is Temple Fields, Harlow, Essex, CM20 2BH.

These interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable law, the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, as
adopted by the European Union.

These interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of
the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019 were approved by the
Board of Directors on 5 March 2020 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the
auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not
contain any statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

The interim financial statements do not include all the notes of the type normally included in annual
financial statements. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the
year ended 31 December 2019 and any public announcements made by the Company during the interim
reporting period.

After making enquiries and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, the
Directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the interim financial statements for the Group, it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis.

**2. Accounting policies**

The annual financial statements of Synthomer plc are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union and applicable law. The same accounting policies and methods of computations are
followed in these financial statements as in the most recent audited annual financial statements. There are
no updates to IFRSs effective from 2020 that impact the Group.

**3. Special Items**

**IFRS and Underlying performance**

The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and as such include all sources
of income and expense, including both one-off items and those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing
businesses. To provide additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses,
management uses ‘‘Underlying’’ performance as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control
and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it
excludes Special Items.

**Special Items**

Special Items are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying
performance.

Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance in the year,
or both. An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to
acquired customer relationships. The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the
income statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group considers that the exclusion of
the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double
counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The definition of Special Items is shown in note 17 and has been consistently applied.

**Profit/(loss) before taxation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1.7** (4.8) (15.7)

The following items of income and expense were reported as Special Items and accordingly were excluded
from Underlying performance:

- Acquisition costs and related gains in the three months to March 2020 relate to the acquisition of
OMNOVA Solutions Inc and comprise £2.7 million of costs offset by a gain of £8.7 million on a
foreign exchange derivative entered into in July 2019 to hedge the acquisition price. Acquisition costs
in 2019 also relate to the acquisition of OMNOVA partly offset by a gain of £4.0m on the foreign
exchange derivative.

- Amortisation of intangibles decreased during the period as the final tranche of customer-related
intangibles from the 2011 PolymerLatex acquisition reached the end of their amortisation period in
Q1 2019.

- Restructuring and site closure costs in 2019 related to the reorganisation of the Group into global
business segments.

- Foreign exchange gain on rights issue represents a gain made on a forward contract which was entered
into to swap the proceeds of the Sterling rights issue into Euro in order to pay down part of the
Group’s Euro borrowings.

- In July 2018 the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix Euro interest rates on the full value of
the A440 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility. The fair value of the unhedged interest
derivatives relates to the mark-to-market of the swap at the respective period ends in excess of the
Group’s current borrowings.

**4. Segmental analysis**

The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group’s
performance.

With the acquisition of Omnova the Group has reassessed how the business will be managed going
forwards. The Group’s Acrylates business, which was previously managed and reported within the
Industrial Specialities division has been identified as a separate segment by the Group’s Executive
Committee. A new management structure has been implemented and management information for
Acrylates is now reported separately to the Committee.

**4. Segmental analysis (Continued)**

The Group’s reportable segments are:

_Performance Elastomers_

Performance Elastomers is focused on healthcare, paper, carpet and foam markets through our waterbased Nitrile Butadiene Rubber latex (NBR) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber latex (SBR) products.

_Functional Solutions_

Functional Solutions is focused on coatings, construction, adhesives and technical textiles markets through
our water-based acrylic and vinylic based dispersions products.

_Industrial Specialities_

Industrial Specialities is focused on speciality chemical additives and non-water-based chemistry for a
broad range of applications from polymer additives to emerging materials and technologies.

_Acrylates_

Acrylates is focused on the production of acrylate monomers which are sold to external customers in
European markets as well as our European Functional Solutions business.

The Group’s Executive Committee is the chief operating decision maker and primarily uses a measure of
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to assess the performance of the
operating segments. No information is provided to the Group’s Executive Committee at the segment level
concerning interest income, interest expense, income tax or other material non-cash items.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

**6. Tax**

Tax on the Underlying profit before taxation for the three month period was charged at 17.9% (three
months ended 31 March 2019: 14.1%; year ended 31 December 2019: 14.0%), representing the best
estimate of the annual effective income tax rate expected for the full year.

Inclusion of the best estimate for the tax charge on the Special Items results in a tax rate of 15.1% (three
months ended 31 March 2019: 13.2%; year ended 31 December 2019: 14.8%), on the IFRS profit before
taxation. The difference in the effective tax rate on the Underlying profit before tax and the IFRS profit
before tax reflects the tax associated with the Special Items, some of which are not taxable or subject to tax
deductions.

**8. Financial instruments**

The risks associated with the Group’s financial instruments and related polices are detailed in the 2019
Annual Report in note 22 to the financial statements. There have been no changes in the risks and the
management thereof since 31 December 2019.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are
not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying period end exchange rates. The
carrying amount of borrowings approximates to book value.

The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices
that are directly or indirectly observable (Level 2 as defined in IFRS 13).

There are no significant differences between the carrying value and fair value of either financial assets or
financial liabilities.

**9. Defined benefit schemes**

The value of the defined benefit plan assets has been updated to reflect their market value as at 31 March
2020. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The liabilities have been updated to reflect the change in
the discount rate and other assumptions.

(31 March 2019: £1.9m, 31 December 2019: £1.7 million).

On 31 March 2020 the Group drew down A420.7m of its A520.0m unsecured bridge facility in order to settle

2020 was £11.6m (31 March 2019: £14.4m, 31 December 2019: £11.7m).

**12. Contingent liabilities**

During 2018, the European Commission (the ‘Commission’) initiated an investigation into practices
relating to the purchase of Styrene monomer by companies, including Synthomer, operating in the
European Economic Area. The Company has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission
during its investigation. As the investigation is ongoing and the Commission does not provide feedback on
its work until the investigation is complete, it is not possible to determine whether or not a liability exists in
relation to this matter.

**Notes to the interim financial statements (Continued)**

**13. Related party transactions**

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on
consolidation and are not included in this note. Other than the relationship with the UK defined benefit
pension scheme as disclosed in note 26 of the 2019 Annual Report, there were no other related party
transactions requiring disclosure.

Following the rights issue which completed on 29 July 2019, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad Group holds
20.98% of the Company’s shares and is considered to be a related party from this date.

**14. Post balance sheet events**

On 1 April 2020, the Group completed its acquisition of Omnova Solutions Inc at a price of $10.15 per
share, representing an enterprise value of $824 million (£654 million). The acquisition strengthens
Synthomer’s presence in North America and increases its presence in Europe and Asia. The asset
identification and fair value allocation processes are currently under review. At the date of this report it is
impracticable to disclose the provisional fair values of the acquired assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities
and goodwill.

It is unclear what impact the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Group’s financial
performance for the year. Speciality chemicals are designated as key industrial assets in the geographies in
which Synthomer operates and throughout the peak of the pandemic in Asia and Europe, the Group
continued to operate 37 of its 38 global manufacturing sites. April and May volumes for the enlarged
business were impacted across the Group and whilst demand for Nitrile latex, non-wovens and adhesives
remained strong, sales into industrial markets including automotive, coatings, graphic paper, carpet and
the oil & gas sector were impacted by COVID-19. Volumes were lower than a strong comparative period
by approximately 20% although volumes did strengthen towards the end of May.

Synthomer has a strong financial position, but a number of steps have been taken to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 and to preserve liquidity, cashflow and financial position. These include reducing capital
expenditure for 2020 to approximately £50.0m from the £73.5m originally anticipated (including
OMNOVA) and suspension of the final dividend for 2019. The Group’s Board, Executive and Senior
Management have also frozen their salaries at 2019 levels and delayed any further review until October
2020.

**15. Seasonality**

Historically, the Group has seen no visible fixed pattern to seasonality in Q1 trading compared to rest of
the year but we do note seasonality in our working capital with an expected outflow in Q1 compared to the
December position. However, in 2020 it is unclear what impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the
Group’s financial performance for the full year.

**16. Risks and uncertainties**

The Group faces a number of risks which, if they arise, could affect its ability to achieve its strategic
objectives. As with any business, risk assessment and the implementation of mitigating actions and controls
are vital to successfully achieving the Group’s strategy. The Directors are responsible for determining the
nature of these risks and ensuring appropriate mitigating actions are in place to manage them.

These principal risks are categorised into the following types:

- Strategic

- Operational

- Compliance

- Financial

With the exception of the impact of COVID-19, referred to in notes 14 and 15, the Directors consider that
the principal risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group’s performance in the

latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally
relates to acquired customer relationships. The Group incurs costs,
which are recognised as an expense in the income statement, in
maintaining these customer relationships. The Group considers that
the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from
Underlying performance avoids the potential double counting of such
costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying
performance.

The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special Items in
order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying
performance:

             - Restructuring and site closure costs;

             - Sale of a business or significant asset;

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Synthomer plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the ‘‘financial
statements’’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at
31 December 2019 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS
101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the
consolidated and company balance sheet as at 31 December 2019; the consolidated income statement and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the
consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the
financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘‘ISAs (UK)’’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the group or the company.

Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to
the group or the company in the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.

13JUN202019365721


As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement
in the financial statements.

**Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud**

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of environmental, health and safety and
competition regulations, tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant
component teams, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on
the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s
incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of
override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal
entries to increase revenue and management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team
shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit
procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement
team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

- Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting
estimates, in particular in relation to provisions for uncertain tax positions and the valuation of
defined benefit pension liabilities (see related key audit matters below);

- Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account
combinations or posted by senior management.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through
collusion.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks
of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our

We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our
report.

**How we tailored the audit scope**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

As set out on the inside front cover the Group reports its results as three segments: ‘Performance
Elastomers’, ‘Functional Solutions’, and ‘Industrial Specialities’. The Group financial statements are a
consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating
companies, across 21 countries. Three countries, being the UK, Germany and Malaysia, account for the
majority for the Group’s results. We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in these
countries, which were subject to audits of their complete financial information. In addition, to increase our
coverage of the Group’s revenues and underlying profit before tax we performed audit procedures at an
additional 10 reporting units located in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, Finland, the

Netherlands and the Czech Republic. These components accounted for 89% of the Group’s revenue, 94%
of the Group’s operating profit and 95% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
During the audit, senior members of the Group team held a number of meetings with the audit teams at
the key reporting units in the UK, Germany and Malaysia and reviewed the work performed by these
teams over those areas of higher audit risk.

**Materiality**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

Overall materiality £5,810,000 (2018: £6,750,000). £3,500,000 (2018: £5,500,000).

performance is measured in the
Chairman’s and CEO’s
statements within the Annual
Report. It is also a key metric
for investors.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £300,000 and
£3,500,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than
our overall group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our
audit above £290,000 (Group audit) (2018: £337,000) and £290,000 (Company audit) (2018: £337,000) as
well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

We are required to report if the Directors’
statement relating to Going Concern in
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is
materially inconsistent with our knowledge
obtained in the audit.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006 (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless
otherwise stated).

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2019 is consistent with the
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and
Directors’ Report. (CA06)

The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the
solvency or liquidity of the group

F-23


-----

We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:

- The Directors’ confirmation on page 73 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being
managed or mitigated.

- The Directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or
assumptions.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term
viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making
inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements
are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘‘Code’’); and
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and
company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

_(Listing Rules)_

Other Code Provisions

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:

- The statement given by the Directors, on page 105, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the
members to assess the group’s and company’s position and performance, business model and strategy
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the course of
performing our audit.

- The section of the Annual Report on pages 74 to 81 describing the work of the Audit Committee does
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

- The Directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for
review by the auditors.

**Directors’ Remuneration**

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the financial
statements, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with
the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Directors on 12 July
2012 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial
periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 8 years, covering the years ended 31 December
2012 to 31 December 2019.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**31 December 2019**

**1 General information**

Synthomer plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United
Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on page 156. The
Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the nature of the Group’s
operations are set out in the Strategic report.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the
Company. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.

**New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time for the reporting period commencing 1 January
2019 and the impact is disclosed in note 3.

Synthomer has also adopted IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The interpretation
clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when
there is uncertainty over income tax treatment. Synthomer applies judgement in quantifying uncertainties
over income tax treatments and has considered whether it should adjust its uncertain tax provisions in line
with this new criteria. Adoption of IFRIC 23 has not had a material impact on the Group’s financial
statements.

There are no other standards or interpretations that are not yet effective and that would be expected to
have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future
transactions.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of accounting**

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations
and the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of
financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in
the accounting policies below.

The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

**Going concern**

The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial
statements.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when
the Company:

- has the power over the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins from the date the Company obtains control and ceases from the date
the Company loses control. Where necessary on obtaining control, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.

The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.
Subsequent to the date on which the Company obtains control, the carrying amount of non-controlling
interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of
subsequent changes in equity.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions
between members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

At acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair
value, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income
Taxes;

- liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits; and

- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in
which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during a measurement period (see
below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts
recognised as of that date.

A measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a
maximum of one year.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interest in the acquired entity
is remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit
or loss.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in
acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment
testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the

F-33


-----

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An
impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent
profit or loss on disposal.

**Joint ventures**

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method,
interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

**Revenue**

General

Synthomer manufactures and sells water-based polymers across a diverse range of end use applications.
Our products are predominantly sold in liquid form, in bulk containers.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in a contract
with a customer when performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognised at the point in time
when control of the product is transferred from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant asset in line with the Incoterms under which it is
sold. The significant majority of Synthomer’s products are sold under Carriage Paid To (‘CPT’) and
Carriage and Insurance Paid (‘CIP’) International Commercial Terms. Under these terms, control of the
product is transferred when the goods reach their destination. At this point the risks of obsolescence and
loss have been transferred and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance
of the product.

A receivable is recognised at this point in time as consideration is unconditional and only the passage of
time is required before payment is due.

Rebates

Synthomer may grant customers rebates if the goods purchased by the customer exceed a contractually
defined threshold within the specified period. Rebates are usually deducted from the amounts payable by
the customer. Depending on the terms of the underlying contract, Synthomer uses either the expected
value or the most likely amount to estimate the variable consideration for expected future rebates.
Historical, current and forecast information is considered when calculating rebates.

The majority of rebate programmes are aligned with the Group’s financial year end, providing certainty
around how much should be recognised in the financial statements.

Other

The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of promised goods to the
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group applies the
practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of
money.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Foreign currencies**

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:

- exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below
under ‘hedge accounting’); and

- exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to a foreign operation for which
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of
the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive
income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-Sterling operations are translated at
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group elected to treat goodwill and
fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated
assets and liabilities.

**Operating profit**

Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered
probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at best
estimate of the amount expected to become payable. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax
professionals within the Company supported by previous experience in respect of such activities and in
certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are

F-35


-----

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax
is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from
the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying
amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Leases**

Finance leases and operating leases for the year ended 31 December 2018 were recognised and measured
in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.

The accounting policies set out below are those applied to the current period, in accordance with IFRS 16.

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The lease term is
determined from the commencement date of the contract and covers the non-cancellable term. If
considered reasonably certain, extension or termination options are included in the lease term.

At the commencement date, a lease liability is recognised, measured at the present value of the future
lease payments and discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease
liability is adjusted by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any
reassessment or lease modifications.

At the commencement date, a right of use asset is recognised, measured at an amount equal to the lease
liability plus any lease payments made before the commencement date and any initial direct costs, less any
lease incentive payments. An estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring an asset, in accordance with the
terms of the lease, is also included in the right of use asset at initial recognition. Subsequently, right of use
assets are measured in accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. Any
adjustments to the corresponding lease liability are reflected in the corresponding right of use asset.

Short-term leases and low value leases are not recognised as lease liabilities and right of use assets, but are
recognised as an expense straight-line over the lease term.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any recognised
impairment loss. Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to
its working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Freehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —50 years
Leasehold land and buildings and the period of the lease . . —the lesser of 50 years
Plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —between 3 and 15 years

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Finance costs
directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost
of those assets. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each
reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

**Acquired intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value at the
acquisition date, which is regarded as their cost. Where necessary the fair value of assets at acquisition and
their estimated useful lives are based on independent valuation reports.

Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, on the following
bases:

Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —between 5 and 15 years
Other intangibles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —up to 10 years

Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.

Acquired intangible assets are derecognised upon reaching the end of their useful lives.

**Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an
internal project) is recognised only if all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the asset;

- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

- the ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed;

- the probability that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development; and

- the asset created can be separately identified and the development cost can be measured reliably.

The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure
incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no

F-37


-----

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an
expense in the period in which it is incurred.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to
which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or
defective items where appropriate.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:

- financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost (‘AC’);

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (‘FVTPL’); and

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’).

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value including, where permitted, any directly
attributable transaction costs.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair
value, depending on their classification.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost
include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Cash and cash equivalents comprise

F-38

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions, bank term deposits repayable on demand or
maturing within three months of inception.

At each reporting date the Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets
measured at amortised cost. In establishing the appropriate amount of loss allowance to be recognised, the
Group applies either the general approach or the simplified approach, depending on the nature of the
underlying class of financial assets:

- Under the general approach, the Group recognises a loss allowance for a financial asset at an amount
equal to the 12-month expected credit losses, unless the credit risk on the financial asset has increased
significantly since initial recognition, in which case a loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal
to the lifetime expected credit losses.

- The simplified approach is applied to the impairment assessment of trade and other receivables.
Under this approach, the Group recognises expected lifetime losses upon initial recognition.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include trade and other payables, lease liabilities and
borrowings. Borrowings are measured at amortised cost unless they form part of a fair value hedge
relationship. The difference between the initial carrying amount of borrowings and the redemption value is
recognised in the income statement over the contractual terms using the effective interest rate method.

Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
through profit or loss when they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period
with fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated
hedging relationship (see below).

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency options. Further details of derivative financial instruments are set out in note 22.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss
is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a
hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the
nature of the hedge relationship.

Hedge accounting

To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Group designates certain derivatives as hedging
instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as
appropriate.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group
documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of
IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.

F-39

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Fair value hedges

The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency risk.

The fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognised in the income statement and is
recognised in the same line as the hedged item.

Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow
hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the
hedge.

Gains or losses relating to an ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified
in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the
recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a
non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any
gain or loss accumulated at that time in equity is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**Hedges of net investments in foreign operations**

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain
or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other
comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in
the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign
operation.

**Retirement benefit costs**

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when
employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state- managed
retirement benefit schemes are treated as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit
method, with actuarial valuations carried out at the end of each reporting period.

Defined benefit costs are split into three categories, namely:

- service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments
and settlements;

- net interest expense; and

- remeasurements.

F-40

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2019**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group presents service costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses in its consolidated
income statement. Past service cost is recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

Net interest expense is recognised within finance costs and is calculated by applying a discount rate to the
net defined benefit liability.

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest)
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently recycled.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value
where the effect is material.

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.

**Share-based payments**

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at the
fair value of the equity instruments at grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based
vesting conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the
number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity
reserves. The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle these share-based payments in cash
rather than equity.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired,
measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled,
and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss for the year.

**Alternative performance measures**

The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative Performance Measures (‘APMs’) since its
adoption of IFRS in 2005:

- Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from IFRS profit measures.

- EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and depreciation from IFRS operating profit.

The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for the Group’s investors and
so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Further information and the reconciliation to
the IFRS measures are included in note 5.

**Critical accounting judgements and estimates**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements
(other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to
make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. The assumptions for each estimate
are set out in the relevant note referenced below.

- Defined benefit obligation (note 26):

Calculation of the Group’s defined benefit obligation includes a number of assumptions which impact
the carrying value of the obligation.

- Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets on acquisition:

In a business combination, intangible assets are identified and recognised at fair value. The
assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates that may differ
from the actual outcome. These estimates cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the
discount rate used. Changing the assumptions selected by management could significantly affect the
allocation of the purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles.

- Current tax liability and deferred tax (notes 10 and 11):

The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions
around the world and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities, all of which are based on management’s interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and
relevant court decisions.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies

There are no critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are discussed above), that
the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.

**3 Adoption of new and revised standards**

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases with effect from 1 January 2019 but has not restated comparatives
for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard. The
reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the
opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019.

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by
the standard.

- Reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous.

- The accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January
2019 as short-term leases.

- The exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of initial
application.

**3 Adoption of new and revised standards (Continued)**

- The use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

**Adjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16**

The Group has a portfolio of leases mainly comprising land and buildings, chemical storage tanks and
vehicles. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had
previously been classified as operating leases under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were
measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using each lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities in the balance sheet at
initial adoption on 1 January 2019 was 2.49%.

Information in respect of the carrying value and interest arising on lease liabilities is set out below:

The lease liability recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 was £45.6 million. Operating lease commitments
under IAS 17 disclosed at 31 December 2018 were £30.4 million, which approximates to £26.6 million when
discounted at the incremental borrowing rate disclosed above.

The difference arises due to the different recognition criteria of IFRS 16 such as treatment of extension
options and the inclusion of liabilities for onerous leases, previously recorded within provisions.

Right of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any
prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December
2018. Onerous lease contracts required an adjustment to the right of use assets at the date of initial
application.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;

- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

- any initial direct costs; and

- restoration costs.

EBITDA, segment assets and segment liabilities for the year ended and as at 31 December 2019 all
increased as a result of the change in accounting policy. The following segments were affected by the
change in policy:

**4 Special Items**

**IFRS and Underlying performance**

The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and as such include all sources
of income and expense, including both one-off items and those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing
businesses. To provide additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses,
management uses ‘Underlying’ performance as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control
and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it
excludes Special Items.

**Special Items**

Special Items are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying
performance.

Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance in the year,
or both. An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to
acquired customer relationships. The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the
income statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group considers that the exclusion of
the amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double
counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication
of the Group’s underlying performance:

—Restructuring and site closure costs;

—Sale of a business or significant asset;

—Acquisition costs;

—Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;

Acquisition costs relate to the proposed acquisition of OMNOVA Solutions Inc partly offset by a gain of
£4.0 million on a foreign exchange derivative entered into in July 2019 to hedge the acquisition price. The
2018 costs related to the BASF Pischelsdorf acquisition.

Restructuring and site closure largely comprise a charge of £1.9 million in relation to the reorganisation of
the Group into global business segments. This is partly offset by a partial reversal of the provision
recognised in 2018 for the closure of the natural rubber and polyester resins production lines as certain
elements have been less expensive than originally estimated.

Foreign exchange gain on rights issue represents a gain made on a forward contract which was entered into
to swap the proceeds of the Sterling rights issue into Euro in order to pay down part of the Group’s Euro
borrowings.

Amortisation of intangibles decreased during the year as the customer-related intangibles from the 2011
PolymerLatex acquisition reached the end of their amortisation period in H1 2018.

Sale of businesses in 2018 related to the disposal of the Leuna (Germany) site and the disposal of 51% of
the Group’s Dubai operations.

Sale of land in 2018 related to the disposal of the final tranche of Malaysian land at Kluang.

Ahead of the Group’s 2018 refinancing, a process was undertaken to issue fixed rate unsecured senior
notes. Despite a strong response from investors, the Group decided not to complete the transaction due to
unfavourable market conditions.

**4 Special Items (Continued)**

A £2.8 million actuarial adjustment was booked in H2 2018 following the UK High Court’s ruling on
equalisation of male and female Guaranteed Minimum Pensions. This was treated as a pension plan
amendment, unrelated to Underlying performance of the Group.

In July 2018 the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix Euro interest rates on the full value of the
A440 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility. The fair value of the unhedged interest rate
derivatives relates to the mark-to-market of the swap at 31 December 2019 in excess of the Group’s current
borrowings.

**5 Segmental analysis**

The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group’s
performance.

Following a review in 2018, a new Group structure was adopted from 1 January 2019 to reflect the
increasingly global nature of the Group’s operations. The new structure enables Synthomer to better serve
its customers, provide a global product offering and to drive operational efficiencies. Consistent with the
new Group structure, three new reportable segments were identified:

**Performance Elastomers**

Performance Elastomers is focused on healthcare, carpet, paper and foam markets through our waterbased Nitrile Butadiene Rubber latex (NBR) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber latex (SBR) products.

**Functional Solutions**

Functional Solutions is focused on coatings, construction, adhesives and technical textiles markets through
our water-based acrylic and vinylic based dispersions products.

**Industrial Specialities**

Industrial Specialities is focused on speciality chemical additives and non-water-based chemistry for a
broad range of applications from polymer additives to emerging materials and technologies.

The Group’s Executive Committee is the chief operating decision maker and primarily uses a measure of
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and Special Items (EBITDA) to assess the
performance of the operating segments. No information is provided to the Group’s Executive Committee
at the segment level concerning interest income, interest expense, income tax or other material non- cash
items.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

The tax incentives and items not subject to tax comprise profits from the Nitrile Latex business in Malaysia
which benefits from Pioneer Status until 28 February 2020.

In April 2019, the European Commission released its final decision which concluded that, up until
31 December 2018, the Group Financing Exemption (‘GFE’) in the UK Controlled Foreign Company
legislation partially represented State Aid. On 12 June 2019 the UK Government appealed this decision
and on 4 July 2019 Synthomer plc filed an annulment application with the EU General Court, in-line with
the approach of a number of other UK multinationals impacted by the Commission’s decision. There
remains considerable uncertainty as to how any final liability under this ruling will be determined, in
particular given the need to consider the relevance of any UK Significant People Functions (SPFs). The
maximum potential exposure, accessing certain tax attributes in line with latest HMRC guidance, is
currently calculated at £4.6 million.

This exposure significantly reduces on the basis only certain profits are attributable to UK SPFs. Based on
our current interpretation of the relevant legislation, the Commission’s decision, HMRC’s latest guidance
and management’s judgement, the Group has partially provided in the current year against the GFE
amounts previously claimed. Developments will continue to be monitored and assessed.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

From 1 January 2019, the Group reorganised its CGUs into three global divisions to better service
customers and markets. The Group’s goodwill was re-assessed and allocated into these new CGUs on an
appropriate basis.

Fully impaired goodwill relating to disposed businesses was derecognised. Accumulated impairment losses
at 31 December 2019 arose prior to the Group’s adoption of IFRS and are denominated in pounds
sterling.

The allocation of the carrying value of goodwill is represented below:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that
goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions
for the value in use calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. These assumptions
have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The discount rate is based on the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the
particular CGU’s activities and geography of operation. A pre-tax discount rate of 8.4% has been used in
the above calculations for each division. In 2018, pre-tax discount rates of 11% and 12% were used for
Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively.

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent five-year business plans approved by
management and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on estimated growth rates of

3.5%, 2.6% and 2.6% for Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities
respectively. In 2018, growth rates of 2% and 5% were used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest
of World respectively. These rates do not exceed average long-term growth rates for relevant markets. The
cash flow for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests. For each CGU, the Directors
believe that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable
amount is based that would cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable
amount of the CGU.

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

As disclosed in note 2, there are various conditions required by IAS 38 for an internally generated
intangible asset to be recognised.

During the year the Group invested £14.7 million in its Pathway programme. This programme is designed
to deliver a unified operating model on a single set of integrated systems to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Group. This programme is expected to complete in 2022 based on the current Group
and the investment is shown as an asset under construction until the deployment phase begins.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair
value.

Before accepting a new customer, the Group uses appropriate procedures to assess the potential
customer’s credit quality in order to set a credit limit. Other receivables mostly relate to indirect taxes.

The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at
amortised cost, using the lifetime expected loss provision. The expected credit loss on trade receivables is
estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience and credit rating, adjusted as
appropriate for current observable data. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of customers. The following table details the risk profile of trade
receivables based on the Group’s provision matrix.

The principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:

The Group refinanced in July 2018 entering into a committed unsecured four-year multicurrency revolving
credit facility (‘RCF’) of A440 million expiring July 2022 with an option to request an extension to July
2023.

As part of the Omnova acquisition financing, the Group put in place new facilities conditional on
completion of the acquisition. These consist of a $260 million term loan and A460 million RCF with
five-year terms ending on 3 July 2024, and a A520 million acquisition financing bridging facility. The
bridging facility is available for 15 months from July 2019 and may be extended for two periods of six
months.

Note:

more detailed description of the categories can be found in note 2.

The fair value of the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2019 was £84.6 million. This does not include
capitalised debt costs.

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s policies, approved by the Board, provide written principles on financial risk management and
the use of financial derivatives. These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has a policy of hedging significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at operating
company level. The Group regularly reviews its net assets and borrowing currency exposures, borrowing in
overseas currencies in order to hedge the net assets held in those currencies as appropriate. The Group
does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for
speculative purposes.

Currency risk

The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many
currencies. As a result, it is subject to foreign currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will
affect the Group’s transactions and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its operations.

To manage the currency risk the Group uses foreign currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency
swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euro, US dollar and
Malaysian ringgit. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign
exchange contracts. The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets
and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose (2018: none).

Interest rate risk

The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar and euro
interest rates. To manage interest rate risk, the Group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate
borrowings, and utilises interest rate swaps. These practices aim to minimise the Group’s net finance
charges with acceptable year-on-year volatility.

At 31 December 2019 the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on the full value of
the A440 million committed, unsecured RCF.

The Group’s interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges with fair value movement on the
hedged portion recognised in equity. Interest paid on these derivatives is recognised in the income
statement, within interest paid. Fair value movement in the unhedged portion is also recognised in profit
and loss, as a Special Item.

After taking account of interest rate swaps, the Group’s currency and interest rate exposure as at
31 December 2019 was:

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **—** **84.6** **84.6** 20.7 292.0 312.7

**Market risk sensitivity analysis**

The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The
Group uses a sensitivity analysis that estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and
other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1.0% in market interest
rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable
at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 with all other variables remaining constant. The sensitivity
analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liabilities and assets, and
corporate tax payable. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as interest and foreign exchange rates
rarely change in isolation.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both
derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis
is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for
the whole year.

For interest rate derivatives the mark-to-market adjustment, and amount recognised in equity as part of a
hedging arrangement, is estimated using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary
items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The
sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where
the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.

Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in
financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises on cash balances, derivative financial instruments and credit
exposures to customers.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet
date as disclosed at the start of this note. A financial asset is in default when the counterparty fails to pay
its contractual obligations. Financial assets are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of
recovery. Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business-related credit exposures.

Financial credit risk

Synthomer aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies
approved and monitored by the Board. Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and
financial institutions with a credit rating of investment grade and the policy restricts the exposure to any
one counterparty by setting credit limits. The Group’s policy is designed to ensure that individual
counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. The
Board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted. Synthomer annually reviews
the credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties’ credit quality, reflecting market credit
conditions.

Business related credit risk

Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and
active risk management is applied, focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and
monitoring procedures. There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables as
the Group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed. See note 20 for
information on credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that Synthomer is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, or that it is
unable, on an ongoing basis, to borrow funds at an acceptable price to fund actual or proposed
commitments. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and
reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching
the maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.

The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted contractual cash flows including
interest payable for the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative instruments. The liquidity analysis for
lease liabilities is included in note 23. Where interest payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of
each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve prevailing
at the respective year ends. Derivative contracts are presented on a net basis.

Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Synthomer’s financing arrangements could, if not waived,
constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with
covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain borrowings and
the inability to access committed facilities. Synthomer was in full compliance with its financial covenants in
respect of its borrowings throughout each of the years presented.

At the year end, Synthomer had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows:

**Fair value measurement**

Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the balance sheet date.

As prescribed by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the
inputs are as follows:

- Level 1—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2—not level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly.

- Level 3—not based on observable market data.

Interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are valued using discounted cash flow
techniques. These techniques incorporate inputs such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which
are used in a discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instrument’s term, notional amount and
discount rate, and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in
active markets, all of the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 financial instruments.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps is estimated
by discounting the future contractual cash flows using forward exchange rates, interest rates and prices at
the balance sheet date.

There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during
the current or prior years.

**Hedge relationships**

The Group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. Strengths of the economic relationship between the hedged
item and the hedging instrument is analysed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from
subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of timing, cash flows or value except when the
critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned. The change in the credit risk
of the hedging instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the economic
relationship.

The notional amounts, contractual maturities and rates of the hedging instruments designated in hedging
relationships as of 31 December 2019 by the main risk categories are as follows:

**Hedged risk** **Notional amount** **Maturity** **Range of hedged rates**

2019
**Cash flow hedges**
Interest rate swap . . . Interest rate Up to A440m 28/08/2018–28/08/2025 0.517% to 0.535% fixed
2018
**Cash flow hedges**
Interest rate swap . . . Interest rate Up to A440m 28/08/2018–28/08/2025 0.517% to 0.535% fixed
**Fair value hedges**
Foreign currency
debt . . . . . . . . . . . Currency Up to A350m 01/01/2018–31/12/2018 £1 : A1.128–A1.140

Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing
basis.

The ratio for hedging instruments designated in both net investment and cash flow hedge relationships was
1:1. Ineffectiveness could occur on either hedging relationship due to significant changes in counterparty
credit risk or a reduction in the notional amount of the hedged item during the designated hedging period.

Cash flow hedges

The Group designated as a cash flow hedge the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on its
Euro borrowings.

In 2019 a loss of £8.7 million (2018: £3.9 million loss) was recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in
respect of these derivatives.

At 31 December 2019 the cash flow hedge reserve includes a loss of £12.6 million (2018: £3.9 million), all
of which relates to continuing cash flow hedges. The cash flows are expected to occur between 2020 and
2025.

In the year, the Group’s borrowings fell below the total of the interest rate derivative contracts, leading to
a reduction in the balance designated as a cash flow hedge. The change in fair value relating to the
unhedged portion of the interest rate swaps was £0.5 million (2018: £1.4 million) which was recognised in
the income statement within finance costs as a Special Item.

**Capital management**

The Board is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the business
so as to deliver continued improvement in the return from those investments and by managing the capital
structure.

Synthomer manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency and to provide flexibility to invest
through the economic cycle and give efficient access to debt markets at attractive cost levels. This is
achieved by targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio between 1.0 and 2.0. In order to finance acquisitions, the
Group may increase the ratio to 3.0, with deleveraging within 12-24 months.

As at 31 December 2019 the net debt to EBITDA ratio was �0.1 times.

The Board maintains a dividend policy to 2.5 times earnings cover. Should excess capital not be deployed
for acquisitions or capital expenditure, the Board will periodically consider one-off capital returns to
shareholders in order to maintain an efficient balance sheet.

**25 Provisions for other liabilities and charges (Continued)**

**Restructuring**

During the year, the Group progressed site restructuring activities in Rib´ecourt, France and Kluang,
Malaysia. Costs in Kluang were lower than anticipated and £1.1 million was released back to Special Items
in the year.

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient to rely on its assessment of
whether leases are onerous under IAS 37. In accordance with IFRS 16, the right of use asset was adjusted
at the date of initial application by the amount recognised on the balance sheet immediately before this
date. At 31 December 2018, the Group held a £2.8 million onerous lease provision for the closed site in
Ossett which was allocated against the right of use asset on 1 January 2019.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations**

The Group operates a variety of retirement benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and
defined benefit schemes.

**Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees. Costs recognised in
respect of defined contribution pension plans across the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019 were
£7.1 million (2018: £6.8 million).

Multi-employer schemes

The Group participates in several tariffs of the Pensionskasse Degussa in Germany, which is a multiemployer pension scheme.

Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing.
The assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated
demographic experience. Therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of
the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts for the scheme on a defined
contribution basis. The Group expects to make a regular contribution of £2.3 million to the scheme in
2020.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable based on an
actuarial assessment of each participating employer’s share of the future benefit accrual. At 31 December
2019 there is no indication of any commitment for additional deficit contributions in excess of regular
contributions.

**Defined benefit schemes**

UK

The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the
Company. The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all
relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy
with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009 and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by
way of a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the
companies concerned. A triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken in 2018 and completed
in 2019.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

Germany

The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany. These schemes are closed to new
members. In line with common practice, these schemes are unfunded and liabilities are settled on a cash
basis as they fall due. At each balance sheet date, obligations are calculated by external actuaries.

Other schemes

The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and retirement benefit schemes. For the funded
schemes, assets are held separately from those of the Group.

The aggregated pension disclosures for the other defined benefit schemes have been compiled from a
number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2019.

**Retirement benefit risks**

Defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed
below:

Asset return risk . . . . The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to
corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the
deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are expected
to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing volatility and risk
in the short term.

Interest rate risk . . . . A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.

Longevity risk . . . . . . The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the
member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’
liabilities.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits)
is re-insured by an external insurance company.

The Group remains committed to funding its deficit recovery plan for the UK scheme. The 2018 triennial
valuation, which completed in 2019, indicated a shortfall of £77.0 million when measured against the
scheme’s technical provisions. This shortfall is expected to be eliminated by 2023 and the Group remains
committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from
£16.4 million in the year commencing 6 April 2019 to £18.2 million for the year commencing 6 April 2022.
Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be £16.5 million in 2020.

The Group’s other defined benefit schemes are largely unfunded, with minimal plan assets. Liabilities from
these schemes are settled on a cash basis as they fall due.

**Actuarial assumptions**

The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2019** 2018
**UK** **Germany** **Overseas** UK Germany Overseas
% % % % % %
Rate of increase in pensions in payment . . . . . **2.80** **1.00** **2.00–2.25** 2.00 1.00 1.90–2.63

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published
statistics. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65
as follows in the table below.

Mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and, where appropriate, include an
allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. In addition, where credible data exists, actual plan
experience is taken into account. The Group’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK and
Germany where, using the mortality tables adopted, the expected lifetime of average members currently at
age 65 and average members at age 65 in 20 years’ time is as follows:

**2019** 2018
Retiring in Retiring in
Retiring today 20 years Retiring today 20 years
**UK** **Germany** **UK** **Germany** UK Germany UK Germany

Male . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87.2 **85.2** **88.8** **88.0** 87.1 85.0 88.7 87.8

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 15.7 years for
the UK scheme (2018: 14.0 years) and 18.2 years for the German schemes (2018: 17.6 years).

Sensitivity analysis

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate
and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of
the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, assuming that all other assumptions are held
constant:

**Increase in**
**scheme**
**liabilities**
**UK** **Germany**
**£m** **£m**
Discount rate (decrease of 1%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **61** **14**
Future mortality rate (one year increase in expectancy) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **19** **1**

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability
recognised within the balance sheet.

**Hedging reserve**

The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed
effective in cash flow hedges. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised
in profit or loss only when the hedged transaction impacts the profit or loss, or is included as a basis
adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the applicable accounting policy.

**Translation reserve**

Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which
relate to subsidiaries only, from their functional currency into the parent’s functional currency, being
sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are
designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are included in the translation reserve.

**30 Contingent assets, contingent liabilities and guarantees (Continued)**

The Company and its subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, entered into guarantees and
counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds, relating to the Group’s own contracts.

During 2018, the European Commission (the ‘Commission’) initiated an investigation into practices
relating to the purchase of Styrene monomer by companies, including Synthomer, operating in the
European Economic Area. The Company has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission
during its investigation. As the investigation is ongoing and the Commission does not provide feedback on
its work until the investigation is complete, it is not possible to determine whether or not a liability exists in
relation to this matter.

**The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust**

The Company established a trust, formerly the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to
distribute shares to employees enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance
Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met. The Trust is managed by the
RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.

At 31 December 2019, the Trust held 1,880 (2018: 110,969) ordinary shares in the Company with a market
value of £0.0 million (2018: £0.4 million).

The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised
over the life of the plans. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £3.61 (2018: £4.91).

The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £1.81
(2018: £2.68). The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions, using a Monte Carlo
simulation model:

The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will
ultimately vest and is based on market conditions and management’s assessment of the likelihood of
achievement of the performance criteria.

**32 Share price information**

The middle market value of the listed ordinary shares at 31 December 2019 was 353.8 pence (31 December
2018: 357.4 pence). During the year, the market price ranged between 279.0 pence and 420.8 pence. The
latest ordinary share price is available on the Group’s website, www.synthomer.com

**33 Audit exemptions**

The following subsidiaries have taken advantage of the exemption from an audit for the year ended
31 December 2019 available under s479a of the Companies Act 2006, as the Company has given a statutory
guarantee of all of the outstanding liabilities of these subsidiaries as at 31 December 2019.

**Group financial statements**

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Synthomer plc

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**
**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Synthomer plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the ‘‘financial
statements’’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at
31 December 2018 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS
101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the
consolidated and company balance sheet as at 31 December 2018; the consolidated income statement and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the
consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the
financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘‘ISAs (UK)’’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the group or the company.

Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to
the group or the company in the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.

**Our audit approach**

Overview

Materiality - Overall group materiality: £6.75 million (2017: £6.5 million), based on 5%
of underlying profit before taxation.

         - Overall company materiality: £5.5 million (2017: £5.0 million), based on
2% of total assets.

Audit scoping - Audit procedures provide coverage of 86% of revenue, 87% of operating
profit and 90% of underlying operating profit.

         - Audit scope covers nine countries, performing procedures over 14 entities

         - Financially significant components in the UK, Germany and Malaysia

Areas of focus - Valuation of Defined Benefit Pension Schemes.

         - Accounting for the acquisition of Pischelsdorf.

         - Provisions for Uncertain Tax Positions.

**The scope of our audit**

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement
in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain.

**Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud**

Based on our understanding of the group/industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance
with laws and regulations related to breaches of environmental, health and safety and compliance
regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the
financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the
financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, UK tax
legislation, UK environmental regulations and the EU registration, evaluation, authorisation and
restriction of chemicals regulations and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant
component teams. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation
of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal
risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure, and
management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with
the component auditors referred to in the scoping section of our report below, so that they could include
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the
group engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected
instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;

- Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting
estimates, in particular in relation to uncertain tax provisions and accounting for the acquisition of
Pischelsdorf (see related key audit matters below);

- Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account
combinations or posted by senior management.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through
collusion.

F-81


-----

We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks
of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our
procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a
complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our
report.

**How we tailored the audit scope**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

As set out on the inside front cover the Group reports its results as two segments: ‘Europe and North
America’ and ‘Asia and the Rest of the World’. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of
reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating companies,
across 21 countries. Three countries, being the UK, Germany and Malaysia, account for the majority for
the Group’s results. We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in these countries,
which were subject to audits of their complete financial information. In addition, to increase our coverage
of the Group’s revenues and underlying profit before tax we performed audit procedures at an additional
11 reporting units located in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, America, Finland, Austria and
the Czech Republic. These components accounted for 86% of the Group’s revenue, 87% of the Group’s
operating profit and 90% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.

-----

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. The
key reporting units in the UK, Germany and Malaysia were visited by senior members of the Group team
during the audit.

**Materiality**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

Overall materiality £6.75 million (2017: £5.5 million (2017: £5.0 million).

Rationale for benchmark We believe that underlying We believe that total assets is

items, is the principal metric performance of the company,

financial performance is benchmark. This has been

CEO’s statements within the the group materiality.
Annual Report.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £450,000 and
£5.5 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than
our overall group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our
audit above £337,000 (Group audit) (2017: £325,000) and £337,000 (Company audit) (2017: £325,000) as
well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Going concern**

In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:

statement relating to Going Concern in
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is
materially inconsistent with our knowledge
obtained in the audit.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006 (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless
otherwise stated).

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 is consistent with the
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and
Directors’ Report. (CA06)

The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the
solvency or liquidity of the group

F-85


-----

We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:

- The directors’ confirmation on page 70 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being
managed or mitigated.

- The directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or
assumptions.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term
viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making
inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements
are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘‘Code’’); and
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and
company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)

**Other Code Provisions**

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:

- The statement given by the directors, on page 92, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the
members to assess the group’s and company’s position and performance, business model and strategy
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the course of
performing our audit.

- The section of the Annual Report on page 69 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

- The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for
review by the auditors.

**Directors’ Remuneration**

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit

F-86


-----

conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the directors on 12 July 2012
to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 7 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2012 to
31 December 2018.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**31 December 2018**

**1 General information**

Synthomer plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the
Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on page 160. The Company is listed on the
London Stock Exchange.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling (functional currency of the parent
company). Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.

**New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for the annual reporting
period commencing 1 January 2018.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. It addresses the
classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new
rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. This standard is mandatory
for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.

The adoption of IFRS 9 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the current period or
the prior period and it is not expected to significantly impact future periods. The Group has chosen to
continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The IASB issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue which is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2018. This replaced IAS 18 which covered contracts for goods and
services and IAS 11 which covered construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that
revenue is recognised when performance obligations are met and control of goods or services transfers to a
customer. The standard applies a five step approach to the timing of revenue recognition.

The adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in the current period
or the prior period and it is not expected to significantly impact future periods.

**New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the
31 December 2018 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s
assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below:

IFRS 16 Leases

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the
balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new
standard, an asset (the right-to-use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. This standard is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2019.

The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Group’s operating leases, and the Group has
undertaken a review to identify all leases in each entity. As at the reporting date, the Group has
non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £30.4m (see note 34). Work has now been carried out to
determine the financial impact on adoption of this accounting standard as at 1 January 2019. Using the
modified retrospective method of adoption the Group expects to recognise right-of-use assets and
corresponding lease liabilities of approximately £43m. The approximate impact will be an increase to
EBITDA of £7m, an increase to depreciation of £6m and an increase to interest payable to give a nil
impact on profit before taxation in the year ending 31 December 2019.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2018**

**1 General information (Continued)**

There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material
impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of accounting**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS Interpretations
Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial
statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial
instruments at fair value through the Income Statement. As discussed in the Report of the Directors on
page 91, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
otherwise stated.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved
where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used into line with those used by the Group.

The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the
Group’s equity therein.Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the
original business combination (see below) and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity
since the date of combination.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest
in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date
of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any
impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently
reversed.

Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a ‘‘Bargain purchase’’, the
excess is credited to the income statement immediately on acquisition.

For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has
been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of
each asset in the unit.

Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, the excess is credited to the
income statement immediately on acquisition.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2018**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent
profit or loss on disposal.

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of
completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in
exchange for control of the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the profit or loss as
incurred.

The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions
for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income
Taxes;

- liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits; and

- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in
which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see
below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts
as of that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a
maximum of one year.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held investment is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses from
such re-measurement are recognised in the income statement.

**Acquired intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:

Customer relationships —between 5 and 15 years

Other intangibles —up to 10 years

Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.

Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are
based on independent valuation reports.

F-95

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2018**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only
if all of the following conditions in IAS 38 are met:

- an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software and new processes);

- it is technically feasible to complete the asset;

- management intends to complete the development;

- there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed;

- it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available; and

- the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised
as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for
impairment. Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its
working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs. Except for
freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:

Freehold buildings —50 years

Leasehold land and buildings —the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease

Plant and equipment —between 3 and 10 years

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to
which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss

been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

**Joint ventures**

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting,
interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

**Leases**

Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the
Group as the lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of
the lease.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or
defective items where appropriate.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**Loans and receivables**

Trade receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. They
are generally short-term in nature and are therefore classified as current assets and their fair value
recognised at the consideration due. The carrying value of trade receivables are considered to be the same
as their fair values, due to their short-term nature. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts are recognised in the income statement based on expected losses

All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of
factoring, the Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are
derecognised. The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the
receivable is factored.

**Amortised bank borrowings**

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are generally short-term in nature and are therefore classified as current liabilities. They
are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective

F-97


-----

**31 December 2018**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

interest rate method. The carrying value of trade payables are considered to be the same as their fair
values, due to their short-term nature.

**Impairment of financial assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment
loss (if any).

**Finance costs**

Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an
effective interest rate on the carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the
construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in
accordance with IAS 23.

**Foreign currencies**

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial
instruments).

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the relevant average
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred
to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in
the period in which the operation is disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group elected to treat goodwill and
fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated
assets and liabilities.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors,
which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency options.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair
value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a
financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition
in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain

F-98


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2018**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of
firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

**Hedge accounting**

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net
investments in foreign operations.

**Fair value hedges**

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in
the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are
attributable to the hedged risk. The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency
exposure associated with the underlying hedged item. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is
also recognised in the income statement.

**Cash flow hedges**

At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement.

Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is
recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or
a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any
cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in
profit or loss.

**Hedges of net investments in foreign operations**

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain
or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in
the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks which become fully liquid
within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in
equity.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Retirement benefit costs**

Current and past service costs in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are charged to
the consolidated income statement. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are
charged to the income statement as they fall due. Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are
recognised in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised outside of the consolidated
income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value
of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the
Group, in separate trustee-administered funds. For the German schemes, the assets are included within
the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws. The assets of the other overseas
schemes are held separately from those of the Group.

**Provisions**

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business net of discounts, VAT and other salesrelated taxes.

Revenue is recognised under the provisions of IFRS 15 when performance obligations are met and control
of the goods passes to the customer.

**Share-based payments**

The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The
Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

**Definitions**

Operating profit

Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.

EBITDA

EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Special Items (as defined
below).

Special Items

The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the
Group’s underlying performance:

- Re-structuring and site closure costs;

- Sale of a business or significant asset;

- Acquisition costs;

- Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;

- Impairment of non-current assets;

- Fair value adjustment—mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate
derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied;

- Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature;

- Tax impact of above items; and

- Settlement of prior period tax issues.

These Special Items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the
segment in the year.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Underlying performance

Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding
Special Items.

Net cash/(borrowings)

Net cash/(borrowings) represents cash and cash equivalents less short and long term borrowings, as
adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments, irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge
accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements and the inclusion of financial assets.

**Critical accounting judgements and estimates**

The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the
level of judgement and estimation required which often involves assumptions regarding future events
which can vary from what is anticipated. The directors believe that the financial statements reflect
appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Synthomer’s performance and
financial position.

Valuation of goodwill and intangibles on acquisition

Acquired intangibles IFRS 3 (revised) ‘‘Business Combinations’’ requires that goodwill arising on the
acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires
the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these
intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome.
These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate
used. Changing the assumptions selected by management could significantly affect the allocation of the
purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles).

Post retirement benefit obligations

Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of
assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations. These are
shown in detail in note 26.

Current tax liability and deferred tax

The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the
world and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of
which are based on management’s interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court
decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply
what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.

Restructuring and site closure relates to the natural rubber and polyester resins production lines, in Kluang
(Malaysia), which closed in Q4 2018, and an increase in the onerous lease and related provisions for the
Ossett site due to a change in circumstance relating to the subletting of the site. In 2017, it primarily
related to the rationalisation of the Rib´ecourt (France) site and the initial onerous lease provision for the
Ossett site.

Sale of business relates to the disposal of the Leuna (Germany) site and the disposal of 51% of our sales
entities in Dubai.

Sale of land in 2018 relates to the disposal of the final tranche of Malaysian land at Kluang. The profit on
sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton (UK).

Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to BASF Pischelsdorf (2017: BASF Pischelsdorf and Speciality
Additives) and for other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred before the balance
sheet date.

Amortisation of acquired intangibles decreased significantly during 2018 due to the full amortisation
during the year of the PolymerLatex customer relationships acquired during 2011. The amortisation
includes £1.4m in respect of intangibles relating to the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf in 2018.

Ahead of the Group refinancing during the year, a process was undertaken to issue fixed rate unsecured
senior notes. Despite a strong response from investors, the Group decided not to complete the transaction
due to unfavourable market conditions. The costs of this process are not reflective of Underlying
performance.

Following a UK High Court ruling during the year in relation to the equalisation of male and female
Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) a pension plan amendment is deemed to have occurred. The
actuarial estimate of this irregular cost was £2.8m.

As part of the Group refinancing in July 2018 we entered into swap arrangements to fix interest rates on
the full value of the A440m committed, unsecured revolving credit facility. The fair value of the unhedged
derivatives relates to the mark to market of the swap at 31 December 2018 in excess of the current
borrowings of the Group and has been taken through Special Items as it is not reflective of the Underlying
performance.

**4 Segmental analysis**

The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group’s
performance and has identified two reportable segments of its business:

**Europe and North America (ENA)**

These markets are well developed and are typically growing in line with GDP.

**Asia and Rest of the World (ARW)**

These markets are characterised by growing at rates generally above GDP coupled with an increased
penetration of more sophisticated products into wider uses.

The Executive Committee primarily uses a measure of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) to assess the performance of the operating segments. No information is provided
to the Committee at the segment level concerning interest income, interest expenses, income taxes or other
material non-cash items.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues.

**5 Underlying segmental performance**

The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and as such includes all sources
of income and expenses, including both one-off items and those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing
businesses. To provide increased clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses,
management uses ‘‘underlying performance’’ as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control
and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it
excludes Special Items.

The definition of Special Items is shown in note 2 and has been consistently applied. Special Items are
either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to
a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s financial statements are in
compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year, or both.
An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to acquired
customer relationships. The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income
statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group considers that the exclusion of the
amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double
counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The Group uses EBITDA as an alternative performance measure as it provides an indication of the level
of cash being generated by the business from its trading activities in the period by excluding the
depreciation and amortisation charges and Special Items. This is also the principal profit measure used for
the financial covenants in the Group’s debt facilities.

The definition of EBITDA is shown in note 2.

Tax incentives and items not subject to tax mainly comprise profits from the Nitrile latex business in
Malaysia, which benefits from pioneer status until 28 February 2020, income in relation to the sale of land
which is not subject to corporate tax in Malaysia and exemptions from capital gains tax available on profits
on sale of businesses in Dubai and Germany.

In October 2017 the European Commission opened a state aid investigation into the Group Financing
Exemption in the UK controlled foreign company legislation. In common with other UK-based
international companies, the Group may be affected by the outcome of this investigation and is therefore
monitoring developments. If the preliminary findings of the European Commission’s investigations into
the UK legislation are upheld, we have estimated the Group’s potential liability to be £5.8m. Based on the
current status of the investigation, we have concluded that no provision is required in relation to this
amount.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units
(‘‘CGUs’’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

The allocation of the carrying value of goodwill is represented below.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted
cash flows. The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate,
profitability and growth rate. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital
adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGU’s activities and
geography of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with
management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors
including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.

Pretax discount rates of 11% (2017: 11%) and 12% (2017: 12%) have been used in the above calculations
for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively.

The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts; for years six
to ten a growth rate is applied. Growth rates of 2% (2017: 2%) and 5% (2017: 5%) have been used for
Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing management’s best
estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets
concerned. The profit for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.

The directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an
impairment.

Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2018, £70.5 million (2017: £70.5 million) is located in the
UK.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are
not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying
amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.

The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices
that are directly or indirectly observable (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).

**23 Financial instruments (Continued)**

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with
the related disclosure required by IFRS.

**Market risk**

The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The
policies adopted to address these risks are as follows:

**Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group monitors interest rate trends regularly, through discussion with its banks, and fixes interest
rates when it is prudent to do so.

**Foreign currency risk**

When it is effective to do so the Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to
hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euro, US dollar and Malaysian
Ringgit. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign
exchange contracts. The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets
and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose (2017: none).

**Hedge accounting**

The Group has interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk in relation to
the ineffective portion of interest rate hedges.

These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the
requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied or is
not effective are recognised in the income statement as they arise. £1.4 million has been debited to the
income statement in the year (2017: £nil). These changes are shown separately as a Special Item in the
consolidated income statement.

**Interest rate risk profile**

**Financial liabilities**

After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the
currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2018 was:

**23 Financial instruments (Continued)**

At 31 December 2018 the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on the full value of
the A440m committed, unsecured revolving credit facility.

The effective interest rate for the year was 1.5% (2017: 1.7%)

**Sensitivity analysis**

The following table illustrates the effect on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in
equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in UK and US interest rates and in Euro, US
dollar and Malaysian Ringgit to sterling exchange rates, before the effect of tax.

US dollar exchange rate �/+ 10% . . . . . . . . . . . **0.2** **0.2** **—** 0.2 0.2 4.0

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both
derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis
is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the
whole year.

For interest rate derivatives the mark to market adjustment, and amount recognised in equity as part of a
hedging arrangement is estimated using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary
items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The
sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where
the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.

**Liquidity risk**

The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely
monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.

At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal committed facilities:

**UK pension schemes**

The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension benefits since
that time are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the schemes are held
separately from those of the companies concerned.

The triennial valuation of the scheme was performed during 2018 and is in the process of being finalised
with the trustees of the scheme.

**Defined benefit scheme**

The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.

The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant
stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with
regard to the assets of the fund.

A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2015 and updated to 31 December 2018 by a
qualified actuary.

The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2015 valuation. This
valuation indicated a shortfall, when measured against the Scheme’s technical provisions of £118.7m. This
shortfall is expected to be eliminated in eight years following the valuation date. As a result the Group is
committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from £14.0m for
the year commencing 6 April 2015 to £18.2m for the year commencing 6 April 2022.

**26 Post retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

The scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to
corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase
the deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are
expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while providing
volatility and risk in the short term.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the
member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’
liabilities.

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits)
is re-insured by an external insurance company.

The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2018** **2017**

Rate of increase in pensions in payment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.00% 2.00%**
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.20% 2.00%**
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.80% 2.50%**

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published
statistics. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65
as follows:

**2018** **2017**
**years** **years**

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate
and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of
the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held
constant:

Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities

Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £48m

Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £14m

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability
recognised within the balance sheet.

**Multi-employer schemes**

In addition to the overseas defined benefit schemes included in the above, the Group participates in the
Degussa Pensionskasse in Germany, which is a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme. Regular
contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing. The
assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated
demographic experience. Therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of
the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts for the scheme on a defined
contribution basis. The Group expects to make regular contributions of £2.3m to the scheme in 2019.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme deficit contributions are payable. Based on the
latest actuarial assessment each participating employer’s share has been determined according to the value
of its future benefit accrual and it has been determined that the Group is liable for total deficit
contributions of A4.6m in three instalments payable in January 2017, 2018 and 2019. As a result an accrual
of £1.3m (2017: £2.7m) has been included at 31 December 2018.

**Legal and customer claims**

This amount represented a provision for certain legal and customer claims brought against the Group.
During the year the time passed for which these claims could be settled and the amounts were credited to
the income statement.

**Restructuring**

The Group has additionally provided for an onerous lease and related costs on the closed site in Ossett,
and as part of the post PAC acquisition restructuring programme, the Group has planned the demolition of
buildings at the site in Rib´ecourt, France. The Group also closed its natural rubber and polyester resins
production lines in Kluang in 2018. The cost of all these restructuring programmes is charged to the
income statement when permitted by the Group’s accounting policy within Special Items. The provision
reflects the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.

**Liability arising on a business combination**

As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty
property. The provision reflects this onerous contract.

The provisions are expected to be fully utilised over the next five years with the exception of the Ossett
overseas lease provision which is expected to be utilised over 50 years.

Other guarantees and contingent liabilities of the Group amount to £8.4 million (2017: £nil) and relates to
an European Commission state aid case in relation to the Group Financing Exemptions in the UK
controlled foreign company legislation (see Note 10) and environmental liability in France.

The Company and its subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, entered into guarantees and
counter-indemnities in respect of performance bonds, relating to the Group’s own contracts.

During the year, the European Commission (the Commission) initiated an investigation into practices
relating to the purchase of Styrene monomer by companies, including Synthomer, operating in the
European Economic Area. The Company has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission
during its investigation. As the investigation is ongoing and the Commission does not provide feedback on
its work until the investigation is complete, it is not possible to determine whether or not a liability exists in
relation to this matter.

**The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust**

The Company established a trust, formerly the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to
distribute shares to employees enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance
Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met. The Trust is managed by the
RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.

At 31 December 2018, the Trust held 110,969 (2017: 249) ordinary shares in the Company with a market
value of £0.4m (2017: £nil).

The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised
over the life of the plans.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £4.91 (2017: £4.70).

The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £2.68
(2017: £2.97). The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions, using a Monte Carlo
simulation model:

**2018** **2017**

Weighted average share price (£) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **4.88** 5.03

Given the option price is £nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the
current share price is £nil. There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be
made but this is considered to be minimal and therefore this has not been modelled.

The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will
ultimately vest and is based on market conditions and management’s assessment of the likelihood of
achievement of the performance criteria.

**37 Share price information**

The middle market value of the listed ordinary shares at 31 December 2018 was 357.4 pence.
(31 December 2017: 491.4 pence). During the year, the market price ranged between 347.4 pence and
575.5 pence. The latest ordinary share price is available on the Group’s website, www.synthomer.com.

**38 Additional segmental analysis**

With effect from 1 January 2019, the Group has implemented a new organisation structure, comprising
three operating segments.

Going forward, the following global operating segments will replace the previous regional operating
segments.

**Group financial statements**

**Independent auditors’ report**
**to the members of Synthomer plc**

**Report on the audit of financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Synthomer plc’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the ‘‘financial
statements’’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at
31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union;

- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Stanrds, comprising FRS 101
‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the
consolidated balance sheet and statement of financial position—Synthomer plc as at 31 December 2017;
the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated
cash flow statement, and the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting
policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘‘ISAs (UK)’’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the group or the company.

Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to
the group or the company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.

**The scope of our audit**


12JUN202000254305


As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement
in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain.

We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the group and the
industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to
applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures at group and significant
component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement
due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the group and
company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules,
Pensions legislation, UK tax legislation, UK environmental regulations and the EU registration,
evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulations and equivalent local laws and regulations
applicable to significant component teams. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the
financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, enquiries of management, review
of significant component auditors’ work and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the
financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the
further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in
the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.

We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks
of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our
procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and

**How we tailored the audit scope**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

As set out on page 2, the Group reports its results as two segments: ‘Europe and North America’ and ‘Asia
and the Rest of the World’. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being
holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating companies, across 17 countries. Three
countries, being the UK, Germany and Malaysia, account for the majority for the Group’s results.

We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in these countries, which were subject to
audits of their complete financial information. In addition, to increase our coverage of the Group’s
revenues and underlying profit before tax we performed audit procedures at an additional 10 reporting
units located in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, USA, Finland and the Czech Republic. These
components accounted for 88% of the Group’s revenue, 89% of the Group’s operating profit and 87% of
the Group’s underlying operating profit.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. The
key reporting units in the UK, Germany and Malaysia were visited by senior members of the Group team
during the audit.

**Materiality**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

**Overall materiality** £6.5 million (2016: £6.1 million). £5.0 million (2016: £5.0 million).

**How we determined it** 5% of underlying profit before 2% of total assets.

**Rationale for benchmark** We believe that underlying We believe that total assets is the

financial statements.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £450,000 and
£5,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory materiality that was less than our overall
group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our
audit above £325,000 (Group audit) (2016: £300,000) and £325,000 (Company audit) (2016: £300,000) as
well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Going concern**

In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:

We have nothing to report.
and the directors’ identification of any material
uncertainties to the group’s and the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern over a
period of at least twelve months from the date of
approval of the financial statements.

We are required to report if the directors’
statement relating to Going Concern in
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is
materially inconsistent with our knowledge
obtained in the audit.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless
otherwise stated).

**Strategic Report and Report of the Directors**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Report
of the Directors. (CA06)

F-145


-----

The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the
solvency or liquidity of the group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:

- The directors’ confirmation on page 67 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being
managed or mitigated.

- The directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or
assumptions.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term
viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making
inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements
are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘‘Code’’); and
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and
company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)

**Other Code Provisions**

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:

- The statement given by the directors, on page 88, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the
members to assess the group’s and company’s position and performance, business model and strategy
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained in the course of
performing our audit.

- The section of the Annual Report on page 68 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

- The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for
review by the auditors.

**Directors’ Remuneration**

In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 88, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

F-146


-----

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the directors on 12 July 2012
to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 6 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2012 to
31 December 2017.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**31 December 2017**

**1 General information**

Synthomer plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies
Act. The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover. The Company is listed on the
London Stock Exchange.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling (functional currency of the parent
company). Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.

**New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

No new standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning
1 January 2017.

**New standards and interpretations not yet adopted**

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for
31 December 2017 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s
assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below:

**IFRS 9 Financial Instruments**

IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial
liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. This
standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2018.

The Group has reviewed its financial assets and liabilities and expects there to be no material impact
arising from the adoption of the new standard on 1 January 2018.

As disclosed in note 23, the Group’s only financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables, which will continue to be held at amortised cost. There will be no impact on the Group’s
accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial
liabilities that are designated as fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not have any such
liabilities.

The Group has confirmed that its current hedging relationships will continue to qualify as hedges upon the
adoption of IFRS 9.

The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit
losses, rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The Group does not expect any
material movement in the loss allowance for trade receivables on the adoption of IFRS 9.

**IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace IAS 18 which covers
contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is
based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.
The standard also requires entities to apportion revenue earned from contracts to individual performance
obligations, based on a five-step model. This standard is mandatory for financial years commencing on or
after 1 January 2018.

The Group has performed a detailed assessment at all major sites, and as a result has concluded that no
material impact is expected on the accounting of revenue in the Group. No material separate performance
obligations are expected, and no material adjustment is anticipated to the pattern of revenue recognition.
Further work is being done to identify any potential increased disclosure requirements.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2017**

**1 General information (Continued)**

**IFRS 16 Leases**

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the
balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new
standard, an asset (the right-to-use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. This standard is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2019. At this stage, the Group does not intend to adopt the standard
before its effective date.

The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Group’s operating leases, and the Group has
undertaken a review to identify all leases in each entity. As at the reporting date, the Group has
non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £34.7m (see note 33). However, the Group has not yet
assessed what other adjustments are required, for example because of the change in definition of lease
term, and the treatment of extension and termination options.

Moreover, the standard offers various transitional arrangements which may have an impact on the
adjustments required . As the various options are still being considered to establish which is right for the
Group, an estimate has not yet been made for the amount of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that
will have to be recognised on adoption of the new standard, and how this may affect the Group’s income
statement and classification of cash flows going forward.

There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material
impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of accounting**

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS Interpretations
Committee and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial
statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial
instruments at fair value through the Income Statement. As discussed in the Report of the Directors on
page 87, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
otherwise stated.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved
where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used into line with those used by the Group.

The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the
Group’s equity therein.

Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business
combination (see below) and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of
combination.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2017**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest
in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date
of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cash
generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and
is not subsequently reversed.

Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a ‘‘Bargain purchase’’, the
excess is credited to the income statement immediately on acquisition.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has
been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of
each asset in the unit.

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent
profit or loss on disposal.

**Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of
completion) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for
recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income
Taxes;

- liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits; and

- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in
which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see
below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts
as of that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete
information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a
maximum of one year.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s
previously held investment is

re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses from such re-measurement are
recognised in the income statement.

**Acquired intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:

Customer relationships — between 5 and 14 years
Technology — 10 years

Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are
based on independent valuation reports.

**Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination are initially measured at cost
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3 and 5 years.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only
if all of the following conditions in IAS 38 are met:

- an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software and new processes);

- it is technically feasible to complete the asset;

- management intends to complete the development;

- there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed;

- it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available; and

- the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

No research or development costs met the criteria required for capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised
as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for
impairment. Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its
working condition for its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs. Except for

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:

Freehold buildings — 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings — the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment — between 3 and 10 years

Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended use.

**Joint ventures**

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting,
interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment
and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to
which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

**Operating leases**

Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of
the relevant lease. Any benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or
defective items where appropriate.

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

**Loans and receivables**

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the
asset is impaired.

All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of
factoring, the Group forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are
derecognised. The cost of factoring receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the
receivable is factored.

**Amortised costs**

**Bank borrowings**

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.

**Trade payables**

Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Impairment of financial assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment
loss (if any).

**Finance costs**

Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an
effective interest rate on the carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the
construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets in
accordance with IAS 23.

**Foreign currencies**

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2017**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts
(see below for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial
instruments).

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the relevant average
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred
to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in
the period in which the operation is disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill
and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterlingdenominated assets and liabilities.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors,
which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency options.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair
value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a
financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition
in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain
derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast

transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net
investments in foreign operations.

**Hedge accounting**

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and
non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments
in foreign operations.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.

**Cash flow hedges**

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement.

Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is
recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or

F-159


-----

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31 December 2017**

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any
cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in
profit or loss.

**Hedges of net investments in foreign operations**

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain
or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in
the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks which become fully liquid
within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in
equity.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities

F-160

**2 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Retirement benefit costs**

Current and past service costs in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are charged to
the consolidated income statement.

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the income statement as they
fall due.

Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income.

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value
of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the
Group, in separate trustee- administered funds. For the German schemes, the assets are included within
the assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws. The assets of the other overseas
schemes are held separately from those of the Group.

**Provisions**

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts
receivable for goods provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other salesrelated taxes.

Sales are recognised when products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation
that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been
shipped to the specified location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer,
and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance
provisions have lapsed, or the group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been
satisfied.

**Share-based payments**

The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The
Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

**Definitions**

**Operating profit**

Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.

**EBITDA**

EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and Special Items (as defined
below).

**Special Items**

The following are disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the
Group’s underlying performance:

- Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;

- Impairment of non-current assets;

- Acquisition costs;

- Re-structuring and site closure costs;

- Fair value adjustment—mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate
derivatives used for hedging purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied;

- Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature; and

- Tax impact of above items.

These Special Items are either irregular and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the
segment in the year.

**Underlying performance**

Underlying performance represents the statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding
Special Items.

**Net cash/(borrowings)**

Net cash/(borrowings) represents cash and cash equivalents less short and long term borrowings, as
adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments, irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge
accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements and the inclusion of financial assets.

**Critical judgements in applying accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the
Group has made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

**Recognition of deferred tax assets**

The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK
pension liability, tax losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination of whether these assets
should be recognised requires a high degree of management judgement and is dependent on
management’s ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply loss positions carried
forward against future income taxes.

**Valuation of goodwill and intangibles on acquisition**

Acquired intangibles IFRS 3 (revised) ‘‘Business Combinations’’ requires that goodwill arising on the
acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires
the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these
intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome.
These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate
used. Changing the assumptions selected by management could significantly affect the allocation of the
purchase price paid between goodwill and other acquired intangibles.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis of making the judgements about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis
taking the current and expected future market conditions into consideration.

**Post retirement benefit obligations**

Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of
assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying value of the obligations. These are
shown in detail in note 26.

**Current tax liability and deferred tax**

The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the
world, and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of
which are based on management’s interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court
decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply
what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.

**3 Special Items (Continued)**

The restructuring and site closure costs included £9.0m in relation to the post-acquisition integration of the
PAC (Dispersions) business, with the majority being attributable to the rationalisation of the Rib´ecourt
(France) site. A further £1.6m comprised the cost of an onerous lease on a site closed during 2017, while
£0.8m comprised costs for the post-acquisition integration of Speciality Additives.

The profit on sale of business relates to the disposal of our South African business in 2016.

The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton, UK. The profit on sale of land in
2016 related to the disposal of tranches of Malaysian land.

The gain of £13.1m in 2016 resulted from foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US
dollar purchase consideration of the PAC (Dispersions) acquisition.

Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to Speciality Additives (2016: PAC (Dispersions)) and for other
potential acquisitions which will not occur, or have not occurred before the balance sheet date.

The amortisation of intangibles increased during 2017 due to a full year of amortisation for the 2016 PAC
(Dispersions) acquisition, the intangibles acquired with Speciality Additives and due to foreign currency
exchange rate movements.

**4 Segmental analysis**

The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, examines the Group’s
performance and has identified two reportable segments of its business:

**Europe and North America (ENA)**

These markets are well developed and are typically growing in line with GDP.

**Asia and Rest of the World (ARW)**

These markets are characterised by growing at rates generally above GDP coupled with an increased
penetration of more sophisticated products into wider uses.

The Executive Committee primarily uses Underlying operating profit, being operating profit before
Special Items, to assess the performance of the operating segments. No information is provided to the
Executive Committee at the segment level concerning interest income, interest expenses, income taxes or
other material non-cash items.

No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues.

**Group financial statements**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2017 (Continued)**

**5 Underlying segmental performance**

The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and as such includes all sources
of income and expenses, including both irregular items and those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing
businesses. To provide additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses, the
management uses ‘‘Underlying performance’’ as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control
and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures as it
excludes Special Items.

The definition of Special Items is shown in note 2 and has been consistently applied. Special Items are
either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to
a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s financial statements are in
compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the segment in the year, or both.

An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates to acquired
customer relationships. The Group incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income
statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group considers that the exclusion of the
amortisation charge on acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double
counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

**6 EBITDA**

The Group uses EBITDA as an alternative performance measure as it provides an indication of the level
of cash being generated by the business from its trading activities in the period by excluding the
depreciation and amortisation charges and Special Items. This is also the principal profit measure used for
the financial covenants in the Group’s debt facilities.

The definition of EBITDA is shown in note 2.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units
(‘‘CGUs’’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

The allocation of the carrying value of goodwill is represented below.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted
cash flows. The key assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate,
profitability and growth rate. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital
adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGU’s activities and
geography of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with
management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors
including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.

Pre-tax discount rates of 11% (2016: 11%) and 12% (2016: 12%) have been used in the above calculations
for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of the World respectively.

The profit used in the cash flows for the first five years is derived from management forecasts; for years six
to ten a growth rate is applied. Growth rates of 2% (2016: 2%) and 2% (2016: 5%) have been used for

Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of the World respectively, representing management’s best
estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets
concerned. The profit for year ten is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.

The directors consider that there is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an
impairment. Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2017, £70.5 million (2016: £70.5 million) is
located in the UK.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair
value.

**Credit risk**

Amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the
Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic
environment. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large
number of customers.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are
not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying
amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.

The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices
that are directly or indirectly observable, (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with
related disclosure required by IFRS.

**Market risk**

The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The
policies adopted to address these risks are as follows:

**Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group
monitors interest rate trends regularly, through discussion with its banks, and fixes interest rates when it is
prudent to do so.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2017 (Continued)**

**23 Financial instruments (Continued)**

**Foreign currency risk**

When it is efficient to do so, the Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to
hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in Euro, US dollar and Malaysian
Ringgit. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign
exchange contracts. The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets
and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose (2016: none).

The currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2017 was:

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both
derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the
analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding
for the whole year.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary
items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The
sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where
the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.

**24 Assets classified as held for sale (Continued)**

The assets held for sale in relation to the disposal of Synthomer Leuna comprise the fixed assets and
working capital of Synthomer Leuna as at 31 December 2017. As disclosed in note 37, Synthomer Leuna
was disposed on 1 January 2018.

**Malaysia**

The Group owns agricultural land in Malaysia, which is operated as a palm oil and natural rubber
plantation. The land is owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex
Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has a 30% non-controlling interest. The directors decided in 2013 to dispose of
this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing facilities, on the open
market.

At 31 December 2017, the status of the disposal programme was as follows:

Other payables includes £7.6m in respect of the disposal of Synthomer Leuna (see note 37), where the
consolidation was received from the purchaser on 28 December 2017, in advance of the date of completion
of 1 January 2018.

Average trade payable days in 2017 was 60 (2016: 71). This figure represents trade payable days for all
trading operations within the Group, calculated as a weighted average based on cost of sales.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables, other payables and accruals
approximates to their fair value.

The 2016 overseas column includes two offsetting one-off items. Following a regulatory clarification by the
authorities, employers in Germany are now required to provide for post retirement disability benefits in
funded plans rather than in unfunded arrangements. The Group has complied with this by transferring this
liability from its unfunded defined benefit plan to a multi-employer funded plan in which it participates.
The latter, although a defined benefit arrangement, is accounted for on a defined contribution basis as
discussed below. Although this transfer has no financial impact on the Group, IAS 19 results in a different
accounting treatment for the transfer in the two plans.

- The transfer out of the unfunded plan is treated as a past service credit under defined benefit
accounting and as such is included as a reduction of £3.9m in the overseas defined benefit charge
above.

- The transfer in to the funded plan increases the liabilities of this scheme by the same amount. As this
scheme is accounted on a defined contribution basis, this additional liability would not be reflected
until additional contributions were made. However, an actuarial valuation of this scheme has been
performed in the year, which concluded that additional contributions were required to address
underfunding. As a result the overseas defined contribution amount above includes an additional
charge of £3.6m.

**UK pension schemes**

The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension benefits since
that time are provided by way of a defined contribution scheme.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.

**Defined benefit scheme**

The UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the
Company.

The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant
stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with
regard to the assets of the fund.

A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2015 and updated to 31 December 2017 by a
qualified actuary.

The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2015 valuation. This
valuation indicated a shortfall, when measured against the scheme’s technical provisions of £118.7m. This
shortfall is expected to be eliminated in eight years following the valuation date. As a result the Group is
committed to paying contributions for the period 6 April 2015 to 5 April 2023, increasing from £14.0m for
the year commencing 6 April 2015 to £18.2m for the year commencing 6 April 2022.

The scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to
corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase
the deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities which are
expected to outperform corporate bonds on the long term while providing
volatility and risk in the short term.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the
member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plan’s
liabilities.

**26 Post retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits)
is re-insured by an external insurance company.

The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2017** **2016**

Rate of increase in pensions in payment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.00%** 2.10%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.00%** 2.20%

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published
statistics. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65
as follows:

**2017** **2016**
**years** **years**

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate
and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible
changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other
assumptions are held constant:

**Assumption** **Change in assumption** **Impact on scheme liabilities**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £63m

Rate of mortality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Increase by 1 year Increase by £18m

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the
same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability
recognised within the balance sheet.

**Overseas pension schemes**

The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of
these schemes are held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German
schemes (net liability £72.1m, 2016: £69.6m) where in line with common practice, the assets are held within
the respective companies.

assets of all participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated
demographic experience, therefore sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of
the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts for the scheme on a defined
contribution basis. The Group expects to make regular contributions of £2.3m to the scheme in 2018.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable. Based on the
latest actuarial assessment each participating employer’s share has been determined according to the value
of its future benefit accrual and it has been determined that the Group is liable for total deficit
contributions of A4.6m in three installments payable in January 2017, 2018 and 2019. As a result an accrual
of £2.7m (2016: £3.6m) has been included at 31 December 2017 representing the present value of these
contributions not yet paid.

**Environmental restoration**

A provision is recognised for the costs to be incurred in the restoration of land which is no longer being
used as a manufacturing site.

**Legal and customer claims**

This amount represents a provision for certain legal and customer claims brought against the Group. In the
directors’ opinion, after taking appropriate legal advice, the outcome of these claims will not give rise to
any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 December 2017.

**Restructuring**

The ‘‘Synthomer 2015’’ restructuring exercise was commenced in 2014. In 2017 the Group provided for an
onerous lease on the site in Osset, and as part of the post PAC (Dispersions) acquisition restructuring
programme, the Group has planned the demolition of buildings at the site in Rib´ecourt, France. The cost
of all these restructuring programmes is charged to the income statement when permitted by the Group’s
accounting policy, within Special Items. The provision reflects the amount that has been charged but not
yet spent.

**Liability arising on a business combination**

As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty
property. The provision reflects this onerous contract.

The provisions are expected to be fully utilised over the next five years.

For options outstanding as at 31 December 2017, the exercise price was £nil and the weighted average
remaining contractual life was 4.73 years (2016: 5.0 years).

**The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust**

The Company established a trust, formerly the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to
distribute shares to employees enabling the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance
Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met. The Trust is managed by the
RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.

At 31 December 2017, the Trust held 249 (2016: 26,794) ordinary shares in the Company with a market
value of £nil (2016: £0.1 million). The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are
under option. Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £4.70 (2016: £3.56).

The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £2.97
(2016: £1.84). The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions:

**2017** **2016**

Weighted average share price (£) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **5.03** 3.67

Given the option price is £nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the
current share price is £nil. There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be
made but this is considered to be minimal and therefore this has not been modelled.

The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will
ultimately vest and is based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the
performance criteria.

International Financial Reporting Standard 3 ‘‘Business Combinations’’ (revised 2008) requires the assets
acquired to be initially recorded at Fair Value at the date of acquisition. Any such Fair Value adjustments
are provisional and will be finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date. Any resulting changes in
the fair values may have an impact on the depreciation from the date of acquisition and would be recorded
in the financial statements.

Due to the short period of time since acquisition, neither a preliminary assessment of intangible assets nor
the Property Plant and Equipment (PPE) valuation had been completed at the date of these financial
statements. When the final valuation work is concluded, a substantial increase is anticipated in PPE,
intangible assets and associated deferred tax liabilities, along with a corresponding reduction in goodwill.

The acquisition of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR business was completed on 31 January 2018. The acquired
business has therefore not contributed to the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Sufficient information is not currently available to disclose the contribution to the Group if the acquisition
had been made on 1 January 2017.

**Sale of business**

On 1 January 2018, the Group disposed of 100% of the share capital of Synthomer Leuna GmbH for
£7.6m. The net assets of Synthomer Leuna GmbH of £6.5m were transferred to assets held for sale prior to
disposal.

**OMNOVA SOLUTIONS INC.**

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**As of February 29, 2020**

**(Dollars In Millions, Except Share Data)**

**Note A—Pending Merger, Basis of Presentation, Description of Business, and Accounting Standards**

**Pending Merger**

On July 3, 2019, OMNOVA Solutions Inc. (the ‘‘Company’’) announced that it entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the ‘‘Merger Agreement’’) with Synthomer plc (‘‘Synthomer’’), Spirit USA
Holdings Inc. (‘‘Merger Sub’’), and Synthomer USA LLC, pursuant to which Merger Sub, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Synthomer, would merge with and into the Company, subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals and other customary conditions (the ‘‘Merger’’).

Upon consummation of the Merger (the ‘‘Effective Time’’), each common share, par value $0.10 per share,
of the Company (‘‘Company Common Shares’’) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than dissenting shares, shares held in the treasury of the Company and shares held by
Synthomer or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will be canceled and automatically converted into the
right to receive $10.15 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the
‘‘Per-Share Amount’’).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each unvested Company restricted share, restricted share unit, and
performance share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per-Share Amount. Each Company
performance share will be considered to have vested at target achievement levels.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including, among
others, covenants: (a) that each of the Company, Synthomer, and Merger Sub uses its reasonable best
efforts to cause the proposed transactions to be consummated; (b) that require the Company, Synthomer
and Merger Sub to take certain actions that may be necessary to obtain required antitrust approvals;
(c) that require the Company (i) subject to certain restrictions, to operate in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice until the Effective Time, (ii) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the making of any inquiries or proposals relating to alternate transactions or,
subject to certain exceptions, engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, and (iii) to
convene a meeting of the Company’s shareholders and solicit proxies from its shareholders in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (d) that require Synthomer (y) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the making of any offers or proposals relating to certain acquisitions of Synthomer’s
equity or assets or, subject to certain exceptions, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto, and (z) to convene a meeting of Synthomer’s shareholders and solicit proxies from its
shareholders in favor of approving the transactions and certain matters related thereto.

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the
proposed transactions are not consummated by nine (9) months after the date of the Merger Agreement,
subject to an automatic extension for an additional period of three (3) months if necessary to obtain
regulatory clearances. Consummation of the proposed transactions is not subject to any financing
condition.

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that, upon termination of the
Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, without limitation, (i) a change in the
recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by the
Company to enter into an agreement for a ‘‘superior proposal,’’ the Company will pay Synthomer a cash
termination fee equal to $15.8 million, and (ii) a change in recommendation of Synthomer’s Board of
Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Synthomer due to a failure in
certain circumstances to obtain certain antitrust approvals with respect to the transactions, Synthomer will
pay the Company a cash termination fee equal to $15.8 million.

The proposed Merger has been unanimously approved by the respective Boards and shareholders of
Synthomer and the Company, and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The closing of the
Merger is expected to occur on April 1, 2020.

**As of February 29, 2020**

**(Dollars In Millions, Except Share Data)**

**Note A—Pending Merger, Basis of Presentation, Description of Business, and Accounting Standards**
**(Continued)**

**Basis of Presentation**

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements and with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the OMNOVA Solutions Inc. (‘‘OMNOVA
Solutions’’, ‘‘OMNOVA’’, the ‘‘Company’’, ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’ or ‘‘our’’) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2019, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’).

The consolidated financial statements as of February 29, 2020 have been derived from the unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements at that date and do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.

These interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of
Management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period and all such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature except as disclosed herein. The results of operations for the
interim period are not necessarily indicative, if annualized, of those to be expected for the full year.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially
differ from those estimates.

The consolidation method is followed to report investments in subsidiaries. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated during the consolidation process of these
accounts.

A detailed description of the Company’s significant accounting policies and Management judgments is
located in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2019, included in
the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

**Accounting Standards**

**Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020**

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued Accounting Standards
Update (‘‘ASU’’) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet the
assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with a lease term of more than
twelve months. Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification
affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease.
The new guidance was effective for the Company’s fiscal year that began on December 1, 2019 and
required a modified retrospective approach to the adoption for lessees related to capital and operating
leases existing at, or entered into after, the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements, with certain practical expedients available.

The Company adopted this standard, effective December 1, 2019, using this new transition method under
ASU 2018-11. The Company elected to adopt the package of practical expedients permitted under the
transition guidance, which allowed the Company to carryforward historical lease classification, assessment
on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to the
adoption of the new standard. The Company also elected to combine lease and non-lease components and
to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. The Company
has determined the initial impact to be approximately $27.0 million recognized as total rights of use assets
and approximately $28.5 million for total lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 1, 2019, inclusive of financing leases that were previously recognized as capital leases. The
Company also recognized a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.3 million for the
accounting impact of the fair value of right of use assets and previously recorded prepaid lease expense.
Refer to Note N for additional information.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which allows a reclassification from accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for standard tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 must be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each
period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act is recognized. The Company adopted this standard, effective December 1, 2019, and determined
that it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

**(Continued)**

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, which applies targeted
improvements to the hedge accounting guidance, including removing the requirement to record the
ineffective portion of a hedging instrument in current period income. The Company adopted this standard,
effective December 1, 2019, and determined that it did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.

**Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted**

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit
Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20) Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Defined Benefit Plans, which allows employers that sponsor defined benefit pensions or other
post-retirement plans to select modifications to the disclosure requirements, and includes clarification to
the disclosure requirements regarding projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations.
The ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU-2019-02, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which
removes certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740 in order to reduce the cost and complexity
of its application. These changes include eliminations to the exceptions for (1) Intraperiod tax allocation,
(2) Deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, and (3) Year-to-date losses in interim
periods. These changes will be applied on a prospective basis and although the ASU is not effective until
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, early adoption is permitted for periods where financial
statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

**Note B—Revenue Recognition**

The Company recognizes revenues when control of the promised goods is transferred to customers, in an
amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods in accordance
with ASC 606. When recognizing revenue, the Company applies the following five-step approach:
1) identify the contract with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations, 3) determine the
transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and
5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company considers confirmed customer purchase orders, which are typically governed by master sales
agreements, to be the contracts, from an accounting perspective, with its customers. Under the Company’s
standard contract terms and conditions, the only performance obligation is the delivery of products and the
performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when the Company transfers control of the products
to its customers. The Company may receive orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that
may extend across several reporting periods. The Company invoices its customers for each order and
recognizes revenue for each distinct product upon shipment, once transfer of control has occurred.
Payment terms used are standard for the industry and jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or
adjustment, to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to receive. Discounts or
rebates are specifically stated in customer contracts or invoices, and are recorded as a reduction of revenue
in the period the related revenue is recognized. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms and past
experience and typically are credited to customers based on achieving certain defined volume levels. The
product price, as specified on the customer confirmed orders, is considered the standalone selling price.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone

selling price. The Company reviews material contracts to determine transfer of control based upon the
business practices and legal requirements of each country.

The Company enters into various payment terms with its customers by the type and location of the
customer and the products offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when
payment is due is not significant. The amount of shipping and handling fees invoiced to our customers at
the time our product is shipped is included in net sales as we are the principal in those activities. Sales tax,
valued-added tax, and other taxes collected from the Company’s customers and remitted to governmental
authorities, where applicable, are excluded from net sales. The Company records returns as a reduction to
sales when incurred. Generally, customers do not have a unilateral right to return products. The Company
primarily offers an assurance-type standard warranty that the product will conform to the specifications as
designed for a period of time or period of usage after delivery. These warranties do not represent a
separate performance obligation.

The following table summarizes disaggregated net sales by geographic region and reportable segment for
the three months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019:

**Note C—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements**

_Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies_

The Company is exposed primarily to credit, interest rate, and foreign currency rate risks, which arise in
the normal course of business.

_Credit Risk_

Credit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a customer or counterparty to settle
its financial and contractual obligations with the Company as and when they fall due. The primary credit
risk for the Company is its accounts receivable, which are generally unsecured. The Company has
established credit limits for customers and monitors their balances to mitigate its risk of loss.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the wide
variety of customers and markets using the Company’s products. There was no single customer that
represented more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales during the three month periods
ending February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019. There was no single customer who represented more than
10% of the Company’s net trade receivables at February 29, 2020 or November 30, 2019.

_Interest Rate Risk_

The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s
Term Loan B, Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and various foreign subsidiary borrowings, all of
which bear interest at variable rates, approximating market interest rates.

**Note C—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)**

_Foreign Currency Rate Risk_

The Company incurs foreign currency rate risk on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro, Great Britain
Pound Sterling, Renminbi, and Thai Baht.

Foreign currency exchange contracts are used by the Company to manage risks from the change in market
exchange rates on cash payments by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and U.S. Dollar cash holdings in
foreign locations. These forward contracts are used on a continuing basis for periods of approximately
thirty days, consistent with the underlying hedged transactions. Hedging intends to offset the impact of
foreign exchange rate movements on the Company’s operating results. The counterparties to these
instruments are investment-grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any
non-performance. The Company maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one
counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not
purchased or sold for trading purposes. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and
changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings immediately. Net losses on foreign
currency contracts that were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, as a component of
other income, were $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three-month periods ending February 29, 2020 and
February 28, 2019, respectively.

_Derivative Instruments_

The Company recognizes the fair value of qualifying derivative instruments as either an asset or a liability
within its Consolidated Balance Sheets. For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the change in
fair value of the derivative is recognized in earnings each reporting period. The Company defines fair value
as the price that would be received to transfer an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a hierarchy
of valuation inputs to measure fair value.

The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels:

Level 1 inputs—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 inputs—Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by
market data.

Level 3 inputs—Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

_Fair Value Measurements_

The Company uses the market approach and the income approach to value assets and liabilities as
appropriate. The following financial assets and liabilities are measured and presented at fair value on a
recurring basis as of February 29, 2020 and November 30, 2019:

**Notional**
**Amount** **Fair Value** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**
**(Dollars in millions)**

Total assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $16.6 $ — $— $ — $—

There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the first three months of 2020 or 2019.

The fair value of the Company’s Term Loan B at February 29, 2020 approximated $291.8 million, which is
less than its book value of $297.8 million as a result of prevailing market rates on the Company’s debt. The
fair value of the Term Loan B is based on market price information and is measured using the last available
trade of the instrument on a secondary market in each respective period and therefore is considered a
Level 2 measurement. The fair value is not indicative of the amount that the Company would have to pay
to redeem these instruments since they are infrequently traded and are not callable at this value. The
carrying value of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility approximates fair value. The fair value of
the Company’s capital lease obligation approximates its carrying amount based on estimated borrowing
rates to discount the future cash flows to their present value.

**Note D—Restructuring and Severance**

The following table is a summary of restructuring and severance charges for the three months ended
February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019:

**Note D—Restructuring and Severance (Continued)**

Costs for restructuring plans are recognized as a component of restructuring and severance expense within
the consolidated statements of operations. The Company initiated the following restructuring plan:

_2018 Restructuring Plan_

During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company announced its plan to close its styrene butadiene
manufacturing facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin, moving production to its Mogadore, Ohio facility. The
Company recorded $0.2 million of restructuring and severance expenses in the first 3 months of 2020
related to this plan. Total expense incurred to date for this plan is $6.3 million, all of which has been paid as
of February 29, 2020. As of February 29, 2020, the plan was considered to be substantially complete.

The following table summarizes the Company’s liabilities related to restructuring activities:

**2020**
**November 30,** **February 29,**
**2019** **Provision** **Payments** **2020**
**(Dollars in millions)**
Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $— $0.2 $0.2 $—

The Company may incur future costs related to its restructuring activities, as processes are continually
evaluated to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of its operations, and to ensure competitiveness
across its businesses and across geographic areas. Future costs could include costs related to closed
facilities and restructuring plan implementation costs and these will be recognized as incurred.

**Note E—Income Taxes**

The Company recorded income tax benefit of $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended
February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first
quarters of both 2020 and 2019 were different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to
losses in jurisdictions in which no tax benefit was recognized.

As of February 29, 2020, the Company has $69.9 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards
(‘‘NOLC’s’’), $8.1 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards, $18.4 million of deductible interest
expense carryforwards, $0.1 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, $0.1 million of AMT credit
carryforwards, and $82.1 million of state NOLC’s. As a result, cash tax payments in the U.S. are expected
to be minimal for the foreseeable future. The majority of the federal, state, and local NOLC’s will expire in
tax years 2023 through 2034 while the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in the tax years 2020
through 2022, and the capital loss carryforwards will expire beginning in tax year 2022. The Company has a
valuation allowance against the U.S. federal and state NOLC’s, the U.S. federal capital loss carryforward,
and the interest expense carryforward.

As of February 29, 2020, the Company had approximately $2.1 million of foreign NOLC’s. The Company
has recognized a valuation allowance against $1.9 million of the foreign NOLC’s as the Company does not
anticipate utilizing this portion of the carryforwards.

With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer open to audits under the statutes of limitation by the
Internal Revenue Service and various states and foreign taxing jurisdictions for years prior to 2014.

The weighted-average interest rate on the Company’s short-term debt was 4.97% and 5.71% during the
first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively.

_Term Loan B_

The Company’s $350.0 million Term Loan B (‘‘Term Loan B’’) matures on August 26, 2023 and is primarily
secured by all real property, plant, and equipment of the Company’s U.S. facilities and fully and
unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by the material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The
Term Loan B contains affirmative and negative covenants, including a requirement to maintain a net debt
leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0, limitations on additional debt, certain investments, and acquisitions outside of
the Company’s line of business. The Company is in compliance with its Term Loan B covenants as of
February 29, 2020.

The Company’s Term Loan B has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The Term Loan B agreement
permits the Company to request additional term loans or incremental equivalent debt borrowings (the
‘‘Additional Term Loans’’) in a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of (a) $120.0 million and
(b) an aggregate principal amount such that, on a pro forma basis (giving effect to any Additional Term
Loans), the Company’s senior secured net debt leverage ratio will not exceed 4.0 to 1.0.

_Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility_

The Company’s Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘Facility’’) matures on August 26, 2021 and
is secured by U.S. accounts receivable, inventory, and intangible assets. The Facility contains affirmative
and negative covenants, similar to the Term Loan B, including limitations on additional debt, certain
investments and acquisitions outside of the Company’s line of business. If the average excess availability of
the Facility falls below $25.0 million during any fiscal quarter, the Company must then maintain a fixed

charge coverage ratio greater than 1.1 to 1.0 as defined in the agreement. The Company was in compliance
with this requirement at February 29, 2020. At February 29, 2020 there was a balance of $22.0 million
borrowed under the Facility and the amount available for borrowing under the Facility was $33.8 million.

_Eurodollar Revolving Loan_

The Company has a Eurodollar Revolving Loan (‘‘Revolver’’) with a borrowing capacity of A25.0 million.
The Company has the ability to increase borrowing capacity through a A9.0 million expansion feature as
needed. The Revolver is secured by European accounts receivable. All other material terms are similar to
the Company’s U.S. Facility, including the maturity date of August 26, 2021. The Revolver provides
additional liquidity and working capital flexibility in Europe. At February 29, 2020 there were no amounts
borrowed under the Revolver and the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver was
A16.7 million.

_Other Debt_

The Company has borrowing facilities at certain of its foreign subsidiaries, which consist primarily of
working capital credit lines, and facilities for the issuance of letters of credit. Total borrowing capacity for
these facilities was $6.6 million and $12.1 million as of February 29, 2020 and November 30, 2019,
respectively. There were no amounts borrowed under these facilities at February 29, 2020 and
November 30, 2019.

_Debt Issuance Costs and Original Issue Discounts_

Debt issuance costs and original issue discounts incurred in connection with the issuance of the Company’s
debt are being amortized over the respective terms of the underlying debt, including any amendments.
Total amortization expense of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts is included as a component
of interest expense and was $0.4 million for the three months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28,
2019, respectively.

**Note K—Share-Based Employee Compensation**

The Company provides compensation benefits to employees under the OMNOVA Solutions 2017 Equity
Incentive Plan (the ‘‘Plan’’), which was approved by shareholders on March 22, 2017. The Plan permits the
Company to grant to officers, key employees and non-employee directors of the Company incentives
directly linked to the price of OMNOVA Solutions’ common shares. The Plan authorizes the issuance of
Company common shares in the aggregate for (a) awards of options rights to purchase Company common
shares, (b) performance shares and performance units, (c) restricted shares, (d) restricted share units, or
(e) appreciation rights. Shares granted under the Plan may be either newly issued shares or treasury shares
or both. As of February 29, 2020, approximately 1.1 million Company common shares remained available
for grants under the Plan. All options granted under the Plan are granted at exercise prices equal to the
market value of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. Additionally, the Plan provides that
the term of any option granted under the Plan may not exceed 10 years.

During the year ended November 30, 2019, the Company granted performance share awards (‘‘PSA’s’’) to
its executive officers. The PSA’s provide recipients the right to receive the Company’s common shares if
specified performance goals, including a performance goal relative to peers, are met over a three fiscal
year measurement period. Each grantee receives a target grant of PSA’s, but may earn between 0% and
200% (or in the case of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, between 0% and 160% for awards granted
prior to 2019, and between 0% and 143% for grants made in 2019) of the target grant depending on the
Company’s performance against the stated performance goals. The estimated fair value of performance
share awards granted is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common shares at each
reporting period and recorded based on achievement of target performance metrics.

**As of February 29, 2020**

**(Dollars In Millions, Except Share Data)**

**Note K—Share-Based Employee Compensation (Continued)**

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award,
and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The fair
value of restricted share awards (‘‘RSA’s’’) and the fair value of restricted share units (‘‘RSU’s’’), and PSA’s
are determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant.
RSU’s entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share for each RSU at vesting, generally over a three year
period from the date of grant. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or
the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not
indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company.

Compensation expense for all share-based payments included in general and administrative expense was
$0.6 million and $0.3 million for the first three months of 2020 and 2019, respectively.

As of February 29, 2020, there was $3.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
share-based compensation arrangements.

A summary of the RSA, RSU, and PSA activity for 2020 follows:

Non-vested at February 29, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,602,862 $7.94

The Company also provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase Company common shares
through payroll deductions under the OMNOVA Solutions Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ‘‘ESPP’’).
The purchase price for common shares purchased from the Company will be 85% of the closing price of
the common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the investment date. Participants may contribute
funds to the ESPP, not to exceed $25,000 in any calendar year. If a participant terminates his or her
employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, the participant’s participation will immediately
terminate, uncommitted funds will be applied to the purchase of common shares, and the participant’s
account will be converted to a regular brokerage account. As of February 29, 2020, there were
approximately 57,000 shares purchased by eligible participants through the ESPP.

**Note L—Employee Benefit Plans**

The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement
benefits for employees. These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), local statutory law, or as determined by the
Board of Directors. The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
Pension plans are funded except for a U.S. non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and
certain foreign plans. Future service benefits are frozen for all participants under the Company’s U.S.
defined benefit plan. All benefits earned by affected employees through the dates on which such benefits
were frozen have become fully vested with the affected employees eligible to receive benefits upon
retirement, as described in the Plan document.

Service cost is recorded in SG&A, while other components of net periodic pension costs are recorded in
Other (Income) Expense. Service cost represents plan administration expenses. The Company expects to
contribute approximately $6.6 million to its pension plans during fiscal 2020. There were no contributions
made during the first three months of 2020.

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan. Participation in this plan is available to
substantially all U.S. salaried employees and to certain groups of U.S. hourly employees. Company
contributions to this plan are based on either a percentage of employee contributions or on a specified
amount per hour based on the provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Contribution
expense for this plan was $0.7 million for the first three months of both 2020 and 2019.

**Note M—Contingencies**

_China Customs Matter_

In December 2019, the China Customs office in Shanghai notified the Company that it intended to issue a
finding that the Company had previously used an incorrect customs code in connection with exports from
China in respect of a small product line. In January, 2020, the China Customs office issued its finding,
which required the Company to pay a $500,000 penalty which was recorded in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for the quarter ended February 29, 2020. As a result of the finding by the China
Customs office, the local Shanghai taxing authority may seek to recoup certain value added tax (‘‘VAT’’)
refunds previously received by the Company in respect of the exported products. The Company intends to
vigorously defend its position if a proceeding is initiated. As of February 29, 2020, the Company does not
have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount of possibly recoupment of historical VAT
refunds and related amounts which may be payable, if any. Accordingly, no provision related to this matter
has been recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of February 29, 2020.

_Other Matters_

From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims, proceedings, and lawsuits related to products,
services, contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property, and other matters. The
ultimate resolution of such claims, proceedings, and lawsuits is inherently unpredictable and, as a result,
the Company’s estimates of liability, if any, are subject to change. Actual results may materially differ from
the Company’s estimates and an unfavorable resolution of any matter could have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows of the Company. However, subject to
the above and taking into account such amounts, if any, as are accrued from time to time on the
Company’s balance sheet, the Company does not believe, based on the information currently available to

it, that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material effect on the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

**Note N—Leases**

The Company enters into operating and finance leases for office buildings, manufacturing facilities and
equipment, rail cars, information technology equipment, vehicles and certain other equipment. The
Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception.

Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and lease costs for these lease arrangements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. Many of the Company’s lease arrangements provide the options to exercise one or more
renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. The Company includes these options when it is
reasonably certain it will exercise them and includes the remaining period in the lease term used to
establish the right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, the Company’s lease agreements do not
include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.

The Company has two leased assets, land and the building for its corporate headquarters, which are
classified as financing leases. Depreciation for assets under financing leases is included in depreciation
expense. The current portion of finance lease obligations are included in short-term debt and non-current
finance lease obligations are included in long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The lease for the land commenced in November 2013 and expires in January 2036, at which time the
Company can acquire the land for a nominal amount. The lease for the building commenced in November
2014 and expires in December 2033, at which time the Company is to retain ownership of the building at
no cost.

The Company does not have any lease arrangements with variable rental payments.

As most of the Company’s lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company
applies an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease arrangement
commencement date to determine the present value of future minimum lease payments.

Lease expense for the three months ended February 29, 2020 was as follows:

**Note O—Business Segment Information**

The Company’s two reporting segments are Specialty Solutions and Performance Materials. These two
reporting segments were determined based on products and services provided as defined under ASC 280,
Segment Reporting. Accounting policies of the segments are the same as the Company’s accounting
policies. The Company’s reporting segments are strategic business units that offer different products and
services. They are managed separately based on certain differences in their operations, technology, and
marketing strategies.

Segment operating profit represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for
restructuring and severance costs, asset write-offs and acquisition and integration related expenses relating
to operations. However, Management excludes restructuring and severance costs, asset write-offs, and
acquisition and integration related costs when evaluating the results and allocating resources to the
segments.

Segment operating profit excludes certain unallocated corporate headquarters expenses. Corporate
headquarters expense includes the cost of providing and maintaining the corporate headquarters functions,
including salaries, rent, travel and entertainment expenses, depreciation, utility costs, outside services,
amortization of deferred financing costs and merger related costs.

**REPORT OF MANAGEMENT**

**To the Shareholders of OMNOVA Solutions Inc.:**

Management of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and for assuring their integrity and objectivity. These financial statements were
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and fairly represent the
transactions and financial condition of the Company in all material respects. The financial statements
include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s financial
statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm
that has been selected and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the
shareholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the Company’s financial
records and related data, internal audit reports, as well as the minutes of shareholders’ and directors’
meetings.

Management of the Company has established and maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are
properly recorded and executed in accordance with management’s authorization and the books and
records accurately reflect the disposition of assets. The system of internal controls includes appropriate
division of responsibility. The Company maintains an internal audit function that independently assesses
the effectiveness of the internal controls through a program of internal audits.

The Audit Committee is composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the Company. It
meets regularly with members of Management, the internal auditors, and representatives of the
independent registered public accounting firm to discuss the adequacy of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, financial statements, and the nature, extent, and results of the audit effort.
Management reviews with the Audit Committee all of the Company’s significant accounting policies and
assumptions affecting the results of operations. Both the independent registered public accounting firm
and internal auditors have access to the Audit Committee without the presence of Management.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of OMNOVA Solutions Inc.

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OMNOVA Solutions Inc. (‘‘the
Company’’) as of November 30, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended November 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‘‘consolidated financial
statements’’). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company at November 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2019, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
November 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report
dated January 31, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies**

**Pending Merger**

On July 3, 2019, OMNOVA Solutions Inc. (the ‘‘Company’’) announced that it entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the ‘‘Merger Agreement’’) with Synthomer plc (‘‘Synthomer’’), Spirit USA
Holdings Inc. (‘‘Merger Sub’’), and Synthomer USA LLC, pursuant to which Merger Sub, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Synthomer, would merge with and into the Company, subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals and other customary conditions (the ‘‘Merger’’).

Upon consummation of the Merger (the ‘‘Effective Time’’), each common share, par value $0.10 per share,
of the Company (‘‘Company Common Shares’’) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than dissenting shares, shares held in the treasury of the Company and shares held by
Synthomer or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will be canceled and automatically converted into the
right to receive $10.15 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the
‘‘Per-Share Amount’’).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each unvested Company restricted share, restricted share unit, and
performance share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per-Share Amount. Each Company
performance share will be considered to have vested at target achievement levels.

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including, among
others, covenants: (a) that each of the Company, Synthomer, and Merger Sub uses its reasonable best
efforts to cause the proposed transactions to be consummated; (b) that require the Company, Synthomer
and Merger Sub to take certain actions that may be necessary to obtain required antitrust approvals;
(c) that require the Company (i) subject to certain restrictions, to operate in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice until the Effective Time, (ii) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the making of any inquiries or proposals relating to alternate transactions or,
subject to certain exceptions, engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, and (iii) to
convene a meeting of the Company’s shareholders and solicit proxies from its shareholders in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (d) that require Synthomer (y) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the making of any offers or proposals relating to certain acquisitions of Synthomer’s
equity or assets or, subject to certain exceptions, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with respect thereto, and (z) to convene a meeting of Synthomer’s shareholders and solicit proxies from its
shareholders in favor of approving the transactions and certain matters related thereto.

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the
proposed transactions are not consummated by nine (9) months after the date of the Merger Agreement,
subject to an automatic extension for an additional period of three (3) months if necessary to obtain
regulatory clearances. Consummation of the proposed transactions is not subject to any financing
condition.

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that, upon termination of the
Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, without limitation, (i) a change in the
recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by the
Company to enter into an agreement for a ‘‘superior proposal,’’ the Company will pay Synthomer a cash
termination fee equal to $15.8 million, and (ii) a change in recommendation of Synthomer’s Board of
Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company or Synthomer due to a failure in
certain circumstances to obtain certain antitrust approvals with respect to the transactions, Synthomer will
pay the Company a cash termination fee equal to $15.8 million.

The proposed Merger has been unanimously approved by the respective Boards of Synthomer and the
Company. At a special meeting of Synthomer’s shareholders on July 31, 2019, Synthomer received
shareholder approval to, among other things, consummate the Merger. At a special meeting of
OMNOVA’s shareholders held on October 10, 2019, OMNOVA’s shareholders voted to adopt the Merger
Agreement. The closing of the Merger remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions,
including receiving regulatory clearance for the transaction in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. On
January 15, 2020, the European Union informed Synthomer and the Company that it had cleared the
transaction, subject to Synthomer’s divestiture of a small Germany-based vinyl pyridine latex business.
Approval by the Turkish regulator is still pending. The Company and Synthomer continue to target closing
the transaction in early 2020.

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**Description of Business**

The Company is a global innovator of performance enhancing chemistries and surfaces for a variety of
commercial, industrial and residential end uses. The Company’s products provide a variety of important
functional and aesthetic benefits to hundreds of products that people use daily. The Company holds
leading positions in key market categories, which have been built through innovative products, customized
product solutions, strong technical expertise, well-established distribution channels, recognized brands, and
long-standing customer relationships. The Company utilizes strategically-located manufacturing, technical
and other facilities in North America, Europe, China, and Thailand to service the broad customer base.
The Company has two business segments: Specialty Solutions, which is focused on the Company’s higher
growth specialty business lines, and Performance Materials, which is focused on the Company’s more
mature business lines.

**Specialty Solutions—The Specialty Solutions segment consists of three business lines: specialty coatings &**
ingredients, oil & gas, and laminates & films. The Specialty Solutions segment develops, designs, produces,
and markets a broad line of specialty products for use in coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers,
laminates, films, nonwovens, and oil & gas products. These products are used in numerous applications,
including architectural and industrial coatings; nonwovens used in hygiene products, filtration and
construction; drilling additives for oil and gas drilling, cementing and fracking; elastomeric modification of
plastic casings and hoses used in household and industrial products and automobiles; tapes and adhesives;
sports surfaces; textile finishes; commercial building refurbishment; new construction; residential cabinets;
flooring; ceiling tile; furnishings; manufactured housing; health care patient and common area furniture;
and a variety of industrial films applications. The segment’s products improve the performance of
customers’ products, including stain, rust and aging resistance; surface modification; gloss; softness or
hardness; dimensional stability; high heat and pressure tolerance; and binding and barrier (e.g., moisture,
oil) properties.

**Performance Materials—The Performance Materials segment serves mature markets including plastics,**
paper, carpet and coated fabrics with a broad range of polymers based primarily on styrene butadiene
(SB), styrene butadiene acrylonitrile (SBA), styrene butadiene vinyl pyridine, high styrene pigments,
polyvinyl acetate, acrylic, styrene acrylic, calcium stearate, glyoxal, and bio-based chemistries. Performance
Materials’ custom-formulated products are tailored latexes, resins, binders, antioxidants, hollow plastic
pigment, coated fabrics, and rubber reinforcing which are used in tire cord, polymer stabilization,
industrial rubbers, carpet, paper, and various other applications. Its products provide a variety of
functional properties to enhance the Company’s customers’ products, including greater strength, adhesion,
dimensional stability, ultraviolet resistance, improved processibility, and enhanced appearance.

**Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.**
generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances have been eliminated.

**Use of Estimates—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.**
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

**Revenue Recognition—The Company recognizes revenues when control of the promised goods is**
transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange
for those goods in accordance with ASC 606. When recognizing revenue, the Company applies the
following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance
obligations, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

**Environmental Costs—The Company recognizes costs associated with managing hazardous substances and**
pollution in ongoing operations as incurred. The Company accrues for costs, on an undiscounted basis,
associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount is estimable.

F-234


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**Research and Development Expense—Research and development costs were $18.2 million in 2019,**
$17.7 million in 2018, and $18.9 million in 2017. Our research and development costs relating to new
products amounted to $6.2 million in 2019, $6.1 million in 2018, and $7.5 million in 2017, are charged to
expense as incurred.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents—The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities**
of 90 days or less as cash equivalents.

**Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements—Financial assets and financial liabilities carried on**
the balance sheet include cash and deposits at financial institutions, trade receivables and payables, capital
lease obligations, other receivables and payables, borrowings, and derivative instruments. The accounting
policies on recognition and measurement of these items are disclosed elsewhere in these consolidated
financial statements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels:

Level 1 inputs—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 inputs—Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by
market data.

Level 3 inputs—Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

_Financial Risk—The Company is mainly exposed to credit, interest rate, and currency exchange rate risks_
which arise in the normal course of business. See Note Q for further discussion on these risks.

**Derivative Instruments—The Company uses, from time to time, certain derivative instruments to mitigate**
its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company recognizes
derivative instruments as either an asset or a liability at their respective fair value. On the date a derivative
contract is entered into, the Company may elect to designate the derivative as a fair value hedge, a cash
flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation based on the characteristics of the
underlying contract. The Company does not use fair value or net investment hedges. For a cash flow hedge,
the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative is recognized as an asset or liability with a
corresponding amount in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Amounts in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction affects
earnings. Ineffectiveness is measured by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the
expected future cash flows of the derivative and the present value of the cumulative change in the expected
future cash flows of the related instrument. Any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognized in
earnings immediately. For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the change in fair value of the
derivative is recognized in earnings each reporting period.

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no
longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item or Management determines that
designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. Any prospective gains or
losses in this scenario on the derivative would be recognized in earnings.

Foreign currency exchange contracts are used by the Company to manage risks from the change in
exchange rates on cash payments between the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts are
used on a continuing basis for periods of less than one year, however these are not designated as cash flow
hedges, consistent with the underlying hedged transactions. The hedging limits the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements on the Company’s operating results. As of November 30, 2019, the notional
amount of outstanding forward contracts was $16.6 million with a fair value less than $0.1 million. As of
November 30, 2018, the notional amount of outstanding forward contracts was $16.5 million with a fair
value of $0.1 million.

The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

**Accounts Receivable Allowance—The Company’s policy is to identify customers that are considered**
doubtful of collection based upon the customer’s financial condition, payment history, credit rating and
other relevant factors; and reserves the portion of such accounts receivable for which collection does not

F-235


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

appear likely. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.4 million and $3.3 million at November 30, 2019
and 2018, respectively. The Company does not charge interest to its customers on past due accounts
receivable.

**Inventories—Inventories valued using the last-in, first out (‘‘LIFO’’) cost method are stated at lower of**
cost or market. All other Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. All U.S.
produced inventory, which represents 47.2% of total inventory, is valued using the LIFO method. The use
of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues for U.S. produced inventories. The remaining
portions of inventories, which are located outside of the U.S., are valued using the first-in, first-out
(‘‘FIFO’’) or an average cost method. Inventory costs include raw materials, direct labor, indirect labor,
utilities, depreciation, freight charges, purchasing costs, warehousing, and duty.

The Company’s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified,
discontinued, or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with historical and
forecasted usage and sales levels. A sudden and unexpected change in design trends and/or material
preferences could impact the carrying value of the Company’s inventory and require the Company to
increase its reserve for obsolescence. The reserve for inventory obsolescence was $6.1 million and
$6.9 million at November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**Notes Receivable—Notes receivable accepted by the Company are initially recognized at fair value. The**
Company does not subsequently adjust the fair value of these notes receivable unless it is determined that
the note receivable is impaired. The Company considers the issuer’s financial condition, payment history,
credit rating, and other relevant factors when assessing the collectability of the note and to reserve the
portion of such note for which collection does not appear likely. Interest income is recognized as earned.

**Litigation—From time to time, the Company is subject to claims, lawsuits, and proceedings related to**
product liability, product warranty, contract, employment, environmental, and other matters. The
Company provides a reserve for such matters when it concludes a material loss is probable and the amount
can be estimated.

**Deferred Financing Fees—Debt issuance costs are capitalized as a reduction to the carrying value of the**
liability and amortized over the life of the related debt. Deferred financing fee amortization is included in
interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

**Property, Plant, and Equipment—Property, plant, and equipment are initially recorded at cost.**
Construction in process is not depreciated until the asset is ready for its intended use and is placed into
service. Refurbishment costs that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized, whereas ordinary
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Interest expense incurred during the construction
phase is capitalized as part of construction in process until the relevant projects are completed and placed
into service.

Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method using depreciable lives as follows:

Buildings and improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 to 15 years
Furniture and fixtures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 10 years
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term, including any expected
renewal periods that are probable to occur, or the estimated useful life of the improvement.

All of the Company’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of undiscounted expected future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized based
on the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value. For
further discussion on long-lived asset impairments, see Note D.

When specific actions to dispose of an asset or group of assets meet certain criteria, the underlying assets
and liabilities are adjusted to the lesser of carrying value or fair value and, if material, they are reclassified

F-236


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

into a ‘‘held for sale’’ category in the consolidated balance sheet or they are condensed and reported in
other assets and liabilities.

**Goodwill and Intangible Assets—Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of**
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and other indefinite lived
intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of September 1, and whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company performs the
impairment analysis at the reporting unit level. The Company identifies potential impairments by
comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is typically
estimated using a market approach method or a discounted cash flow analysis based on level 3 inputs in the
fair value hierarchy, which requires the Company to estimate future cash flows anticipated to be generated
by the reporting unit, as well as a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows.
If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered
impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is
recognized as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value.

As a result of the Company’s annual goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018,
no impairment charges were required. As part of its 2017 segment realignment, the Company allocated
existing goodwill between two of its four reporting units based on their relative fair values. As a result,
$66.3 million of goodwill was allocated to the Specialty Solutions segment and $19.6 million of goodwill
was allocated to the Performance Materials segment. Subsequently, the Company updated its goodwill
impairment analysis as of November 30, 2017, based upon a triggering event that resulted in the
impairment of $19.6 million of goodwill associated with the Performance Materials segment.

The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of comparing the fair value of the asset
with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a
fair value model based on a market approach method or discounted future cash flows. If the carrying
amounts exceed the estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the
excess. Key inputs used in determining the fair value of the trademarks/tradenames were expected future
revenues and royalty rates, and accordingly, their fair value is impacted by selling prices, which for the
Company is based in part on raw material costs. As of September 1, 2019, the Company performed its
annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that the carrying value of two
individual tradenames within the Performance Materials segment were greater than their fair value and,
accordingly, recorded an impairment of $7.8 million. A sensitivity analysis was performed by the Company
on one of these tradenames and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used to value
this tradename would result in additional impairment of $0.6 million. The second tradename had no
remaining fair value. Trademarks and tradenames continue to be important to the Company, and we
continue to focus on long-term growth, however, if recent trends continue, the long-term assumptions
relative to growth rates and profitability of the trademarks and tradenames may not be attained, which
could result in additional impairment to one or more of the Company’s trademarks and tradenames.

Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgments and assumptions by Management including
sales, operating margins, royalty rates, discount rates, and future economic conditions. To the extent that
we are not able to achieve these assumptions, impairment losses may occur.

Finite lived intangible assets, such as customer lists, patents, certain trademarks/tradenames, and licenses,
are recorded at cost or estimated fair value when acquired as part of a business combination. Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives with periods ranging from 3 to
53 years. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual
disposition may be less than their net carrying value. No such events or circumstances occurred in 2019,
2018, or 2017.

**Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans—The Company accounts for its pensions and other**
post-retirement benefits by (1) recognizing the funded status of the benefit plans in our consolidated
balance sheets, (2) recognizing, as a component of other comprehensive income or net periodic benefit
cost, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, (3) measuring
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the Company’s fiscal year end consolidated
balance sheets and (4) disclosing additional information in the notes to the consolidated financial

F-237


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
recognition of prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations.

**Asset Retirement Obligations—The fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded when the**
Company has an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity and the amount of
the obligation can be reasonably estimated. In assessing asset retirement obligations, the Company reviews
the expected settlement dates or a range of estimated settlement dates, the expected method of settlement
of the obligation, and other factors pertinent to the obligations. Asset retirement obligations are not
material as of November 30, 2019 and 2018.

**Foreign Currency Translation—The financial position and results of operations of the Company’s foreign**
subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance
sheet date, while sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates each month during the
year. The resulting translation gains and losses on assets and liabilities are recorded in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive (Loss), and are excluded from net income until realized through sale or liquidation of
foreign subsidiaries.

**Income Taxes—The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this**
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the
period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to
offset deferred tax assets, if based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities along with our effective tax rate in
the future.

A high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent a valuation allowance should be provided
against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets
considering all available evidence, both positive and negative. In determining whether a valuation
allowance is warranted, the Company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future
earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the
likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence
is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. It is generally difficult
to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of cumulative financial reporting losses.

As a result of historical restructuring charges and impairments over the last few years, including a
significant goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company was in a U.S.
jurisdiction three-year cumulative loss position for the three year period ending November 2017. For the
three year period ended November 2019, the U.S. jurisdiction remains in a three-year cumulative loss
position. Considering the weight of available positive and negative evidence, the Company does not believe
the positive evidence (some of which is subjective) overcomes the negative objective evidence of a 3-year
cumulative loss position. Therefore, the Company concludes that the valuation allowance should remain
on its U.S. deferred tax assets as of November 30, 2019.

The Company utilizes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those
benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by
taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
more-likely-than-not of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company’s accounting policy for interest and/or penalties related to underpayments of income taxes is
to include interest and penalties in tax expenses.

**Operating Leases—Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term,**
including any optional renewal terms that are reasonably expected to be exercised. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term, including any expected renewal periods
that are probable to occur, or the estimated useful life of the improvement.

F-238


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**Capital Leases—Capital leases are initially recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of**
future minimum lease payments with a corresponding amount recognized in property, plant, and
equipment. Depreciation on assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. The current
portion of capital lease obligations are included in short-term debt and non-current capital lease
obligations are included in long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has two
leased assets, land and the building for its corporate headquarters, which are classified as capital leases
with a present value of minimum lease payments of $14.9 million as of November 30, 2019. The lease for
the land commenced in November 2013 and expires January 2036 at which time the Company can acquire
the land for a nominal amount. The lease for the building commenced in November 2014 and expires
December 2033 at which time the Company will receive the building at no cost.

**Share-Based Compensation—Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the**
calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period
(generally the vesting period). Share-based compensation expense includes expense related to restricted
shares; restricted share units; and options issued, as well as share units deferred into the Company’s
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and performance shares awarded under the
Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan or 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company did not capitalize any
expense related to share-based compensation payments and recognizes share-based compensation expense
within Selling, General, and Administrative expense.

**Accounting Standards Adopted in 2019**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued Accounting Standards Update
(‘‘ASU’’) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’)
Topic 606, which clarified existing accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes
revenue. This standard prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue, the application of which will
require a certain amount of judgment. The provisions of this ASU may be applied retroactively or on a
modified retrospective (cumulative effect) basis. The standard requires additional disclosures in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures identifying the
nature, amount, timing and significant judgments impacting revenue from contracts with customers. The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and utilized the modified
retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million
for the accounting impact of certain previously capitalized contract costs as of December 1, 2018.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost
and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires that an employer report the service cost
component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by
the pertinent employees during the period. The amendments in this ASU also allow only the service cost
component to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. ASU 2017-07 must be applied retrospectively
for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in
the income statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service
cost component of net periodic benefit cost in assets. The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2019. The Company elected to use the practical expedient to use amounts disclosed in
the 2018 consolidated financial statements as an estimate for applying the retrospective presentation
requirements. As a result, selling, general, and administrative expense (‘‘SG&A’’) increased with an
offsetting increase to other (income) expense of $2.0 million for 2018 and $1.5 million for 2017,
respectively. Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2017-07 did not have an impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2019.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows—Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies existing guidance related to accounting for cash receipts and
cash payments and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU should be
applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted the
amendments of this ASU effective December 1, 2018, and this ASU did not have an impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows—Restricted Cash, which
requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash
equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore,

F-239


-----

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

amounts generally described as restricted cash would be included with cash and cash equivalents when
reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period
presented. The Company adopted the amendments of this ASU effective December 1, 2018, and this ASU
did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted**

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize
on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with a
lease term of more than twelve months. Leases will continue to be classified as either financing or
operating, with classification affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and
cash flows arising from a lease. The new guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year that begins on
December 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective approach to the adoption for lessees related to
capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the earliest comparative period presented in
the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.

The Company plans to adopt this standard, effective December 1, 2019, using this new transition method
under ASU 2018-11. The Company has elected to adopt the package of practical expedients permitted
under the transition guidance, which allows the Company to carryforward historical lease classification,
assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and initial direct costs for any leases that exist
prior to adoption of the new standard. The Company will also elect to combine lease and non-lease
components and to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or
less. The Company has substantially completed the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this
ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has estimated the impact to be
approximately $26.0 million recognized as total right-of-use assets and approximately $29.0 million for
total lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 1, 2019. Other than this impact, it is
not expected that the new standard will have a material impact on the remaining consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit
Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20) Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Defined Benefit Plans, which allows employers that sponsor defined benefit pensions or other
post-retirement plans to select modifications to the disclosure requirements, and includes clarification to
the disclosure requirements regarding projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations.
The ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), which allows a reclassification from accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings for standard tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 must be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each
period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act is recognized. This guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those
annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted in any interim period.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated
results of operations, balance sheets, or cash flows.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, which applies targeted
improvements to the hedge accounting guidance, including removing the requirement to run the
ineffective portion of a hedging instrument through current period income. The guidance is effective for
annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018
with early adoption permitted in any interim period. Amendments from this ASU are to be applied
prospectively, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU-2019-02, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which
removes certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740 in order to reduce the cost and complexity

F-240

**Note A—Pending Merger, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

of its application. These changes include eliminations to the exceptions for (1) Intraperiod tax allocation,
(2) Deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, and (3) Year-to-date losses in interim
periods. These changes will be applied on a prospective basis and although the ASU is not effective until
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, early adoption is permitted for periods where financial
statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

**Note B—Revenue Recognition**

The Company recognizes revenues when control of the promised goods is transferred to customers, in an
amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods in accordance
with ASC 606. When recognizing revenue, the Company applies the following five-step approach:
(1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations, (3) determine the
transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and
(5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company considers confirmed customer purchase orders, which are typically governed by OMNOVA’s
standard terms and conditions or master sales agreements, to be the contracts, from an accounting
perspective, with its customers. Under the Company’s standard contract terms and conditions, the only
performance obligation is the delivery of products and the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in
time when the Company transfers control of the products to its customers. The Company may receive
orders for products to be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across several reporting periods.
The Company invoices its customers for each order and recognizes revenue for each distinct product upon
shipment, once transfer of control has occurred. Payment terms used are standard for the industry and
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates
whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment, to determine the net consideration to which the
Company expects to receive. Discounts or rebates are specifically stated in customer contracts or invoices,
and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recognized. Rebates are
estimated based on sales terms and past experience and typically are credited to customers based on
achieving certain defined volume levels. The product price, as specified on the customer confirmed orders,
is considered the standalone selling price. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct
product based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company reviews material contracts to
determine transfer of control based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country.

The Company enters into various payment terms with its customers by the type and location of the
customer and the products offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when
payment is due is not significant. The amount of shipping and handling fees invoiced to our customers at
the time our product is shipped is included in net sales as we are the principal in those activities. Sales tax,
valued-added tax, and other taxes collected from the Company’s customers and remitted to governmental
authorities, where applicable, are excluded from net sales. The Company records returns as a reduction to
sales when incurred. Generally, customers do not have a unilateral right to return products. The Company
primarily offers an assurance-type standard warranty that the product will conform to the specifications as
designed for a period of time or period of usage after delivery. These warranties do not represent a
separate performance obligation.

There were no changes in amounts previously reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
due to the adoption of ASC 606. The following table summarizes disaggregated net sales by geographic
region and reportable segment for the year ended November 30, 2019:

Costs for restructuring plans are recognized as a component of restructuring and severance expense within
the consolidated statements of operations. The Company initiated the following restructuring plans:

_2018 Restructuring Plan_

During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company announced its plan to close its styrene butadiene
manufacturing facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin, moving production to our Mogadore, Ohio facility. The
Company incurred $4.3 million of restructuring and severance expenses in fiscal 2019 related to this plan.
Total expense incurred to date for this plan is $6.1 million, all of which has been paid as of November 30,
2019. As of November 30, 2019, the plan was considered complete.

_2017 Restructuring Plan_

Restructuring and severance activities initiated in 2017 include the One OMNOVA initiative announced
during the first quarter of 2017. The One OMNOVA initiative is focused on improving functional
excellence in marketing, sales, operations, supply chain and technology, as well as various corporate
functions. The plan is designed to reduce complexity and drive consistency across the global enterprise
through a standardized, integrated business system. The Company incurred $1.0 million of restructuring
and severance expense in fiscal 2019 related to this plan. Total expense incurred to date for this plan is
$6.2 million, all of which has been paid as of November 30, 2019. As of November 30, 2019, the plan was
considered complete.

_2016 Restructuring Plan_

Restructuring and severance activities initiated in 2016 included continued cost reduction and efficiency
improvement actions, as well as a change in the Company’s CEO. For these activities, the Company has
incurred and paid restructuring and severance costs of $7.6 million. As of November 30, 2018, the plan was
considered complete.

**Note D—Asset Impairments and Sales of Businesses**

During 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Green Bay, Wisconsin plant
shifting styrene butadiene manufacturing to its production plant in Mogadore, Ohio. As a result, the
Company determined that certain plant and equipment were impaired and recognized an impairment
charge of $9.2 million, primarily in the Performance Materials segment, to write-down the asset group to
fair value based on the market approach analysis. The asset groups’ remaining fair value of $2.5 million
were depreciated over the remaining estimated useful lives of the impacted assets and was primarily
included in the Performance Materials segment operating results. The Company successfully completed
the plant closure during 2019. Additionally, the Company sold the plant and equipment during 2019 for
$4.9 million, recognizing a gain of $4.4 million. Also during 2018, the Company recognized other asset
impairment charges of $2.7 million related to idled assets within the Performance Materials segment.

During 2017, Management approved a plan for the Company to sell its CCF manufacturing operations. As
a result, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company determined that the disposal group was impaired
and recognized an impairment charge of $12.9 million, of which $11.8 million was included in the results of
the Performance Materials segment and $1.1 million was included in Corporate expenses. Included in the
calculation of the impairment charge were deferred foreign currency translation gains of $6.3 million,
which were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (‘‘AOCI’’). Accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of the CCF manufacturing facility were reclassified to held for sale in the consolidated
balance sheet as of November 30, 2016. The Company completed the planned sale in July 2017, and
recognized an additional loss on the sale of $0.4 million, for a total loss of $13.3 million. The Company
continues to manufacture and sell coated fabric products in the Asian region. Management considered
other qualitative and quantitative factors and concluded this sale did not represent a strategic shift in
business.

On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act (the
‘‘Tax Act’’) was signed into law which, among other changes: reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate
effective January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21%; repealed the Alternative Minimum Tax (‘‘AMT’’); imposed a
one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings not previously subject to U.S. taxation; provides a
U.S. federal tax exemption on future distributions of foreign earnings; and beginning in fiscal 2019, creates
a new minimum tax on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on
global intangible low-taxed income (‘‘GILTI’’) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with
U.S. GAAP, any potential impacts of GILTI can either be treated as a period expense in the period
incurred or considered in the determination of the Company’s deferred tax balances. The Company will
account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period cost.

The Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 (‘‘SAB 118’’), provides a
measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for
companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. At November 30, 2018, the
Company had provisionally estimated minimal income inclusion for the transition tax related to foreign
earnings on which U.S. income taxes were previously deferred. Under SAB 118 guidance, the Company
adjusted the income inclusion related to transition tax to $27.7 million. The change is a result of additional
analysis, changes in interpretation and assumptions, as well as additional regulatory guidance that was
issued. As of February 28, 2019, the Company completed the analysis of the impact of the Tax Act in
accordance with the SAB 118 and there were no further impacts. The Company utilized existing net
operating loss carryforwards to offset the income inclusion, and therefore had no cash taxes related to the
transition tax during 2019.

For fiscal 2019, the Company’s income tax expense was $3.4 million on global pretax loss of $19.0 million.
The Company’s income tax expense was different than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to
income in foreign jurisdictions with corresponding tax expense which was not offset by losses in the U.S.
jurisdiction in which no tax benefit was recognized. In addition, during fiscal 2019, the Company liquidated
a Luxembourg entity which resulted in a recapture gain of $9.8 million as net operating loss carryforwards

were recaptured. This generated tax expense which was fully offset by tax benefits resulting from the
release of a valuation allowance previously established for the net operating loss carryforward.

At November 30, 2019, the Company has $70.2 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards
(NOLC’s), $8.1 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards, $18.4 million of deductible interest
expense carryforwards, $0.1 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards, $0.1 million of AMT credit
carryforwards, and $82.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, cash tax payments in
the U.S. are expected to be minimal for the foreseeable future. The Company utilized $5.4 million of
federal net operating loss carryforward for the year ended November 30, 2019. The Company utilized
approximately $16.0 million and $7.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforward for the years ended
November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of the federal, state, and local NOLCs will expire
in tax years 2023 through 2034 while the foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire in the tax years 2020
through 2022, and the capital loss will expire beginning in tax year 2022. The Company has a valuation
allowance against the U.S. federal and state NOLC’s, the U.S. federal capital loss carryforward, and the
interest expense carryforward.

As of November 30, 2019, the Company had approximately $2.1 million of foreign NOLC’s. The Company
has recognized a valuation allowance against $1.9 million of the foreign NOLC’s as the Company does not
anticipate utilizing these carryforwards. Cash paid for income taxes in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was
$8.7 million, $6.8 million, and $4.5 million, respectively, and related primarily to foreign income taxes.

Total unrecognized tax benefits are $0.6 million at both November 30, 2019 and 2018. There were minimal
interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2019. The total
amount of interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance sheet was $0.2 million at
November 30, 2018. There were minimal interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated balance
sheet as of November 30, 2017. Of the total $0.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits at November 30,
2019, $0.3 million would, if recognized, impact the Company’s effective tax rate. There was minimal

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax
expense. The Company recognized minimal income tax expense related to interest and penalties in 2019,
2018, and 2017.

With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer open to audit under the statutes of limitation by the
Internal Revenue Service and various states and foreign taxing jurisdictions for years prior to 2014.

The Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings on certain of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries as such amounts are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As a result of the Tax
Act, to the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the
related U.S. tax liability primarily attributable to withholding taxes may be creditable. However, based on
the Company’s policy of permanent reinvestment, it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability,
if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested. As of November 30, 2019,
the non-U.S. subsidiaries have cumulative foreign retained earnings of $50.2 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred $17.9 million of costs related to initiatives
to lower its cost structure. These initiatives involved, among other things, the liquidation of several holding
companies in Europe that resulted in the recognition of foreign currency translation losses in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

**_Term Loan_**

The Company’s $350.0 million Term Loan B matures on August 26, 2023 and is primarily secured by all
real property, plant, and equipment of the Company’s U.S. facilities and fully and unconditionally and
jointly and severally guaranteed by the material U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The Term Loan B
carries a variable interest rate based on, at the Company’s option, either a eurodollar rate or a base rate, in
each case plus an applicable margin. The eurodollar rate is a periodic fixed rate equal to the ICE London
Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’) subject to a floor of 1.00%. The applicable margin for the eurodollar
rate was originally 4.25%. The base interest rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of (i) the Prime
Rate, (ii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month eurodollar rate
plus 1.00%. The applicable margin for the base rate was originally 3.25%. Annual principal payments
consist of $3.5 million due in quarterly installments plus potential annual excess free cash flow payments as
defined in the Term Loan B agreement, with any remaining balance to be paid on August 26, 2023. The
Company is no longer subject to a prepayment penalty and can prepay any amount at any time upon
proper notice and is subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Prepayments will be applied towards any
required annual excess free cash flow payment.

Additionally, the Term Loan B originally provided for additional borrowings of the greater of $85.0 million
or an amount based on a senior secured leverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan B agreement, provided
that certain requirements are met. The Term Loan B contains affirmative and negative covenants,
including limitations on additional debt, certain investments and acquisitions outside of the Company’s line
of business. The Term Loan B requires the Company to maintain a total net leverage ratio of less than 5.0
to 1.0. The Company is in compliance with this covenant with a total net leverage ratio of 4.0 to 1.0 at
November 30, 2019.

On March 2, 2018, the Company amended its Term Loan B agreement. Primarily, the Term Loan
amendment (1) reduces the margins for borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement by 100 basis points
to 3.25% for Eurodollar rate loans and 2.25% for base rate loans and (2) permits the Company to request
additional term loans or incremental equivalent debt borrowings (the ‘‘Additional Term Loans’’) in a
maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of (a) $120.0 million (an increase from $85.0 million
previously) and (b) an aggregate principal amount such that, on a pro forma basis (giving effect to any
Additional Term Loans), the Company’s senior secured net debt leverage ratio will not exceed 5.0 to 1.0.
The amendment also incorporated fallback provisions to address the phasing out of LIBOR, as discussed
in more detail under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

**_Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility_**

The Company also has a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘Facility’’) with a potential
availability of $90.0 million, which can be further increased up to $140.0 million subject to additional
borrowing base assets and lender approval. The Facility matures on August 26, 2021. The Facility is secured
by U.S. accounts receivable, inventory (collectively the ‘‘Eligible Borrowing Base’’) and intangible assets.
Availability under the Facility will fluctuate depending on the Eligible Borrowing Base and is determined
by applying customary advance rates to the Eligible Borrowing Base. The Facility includes a $5.0 million
sub-limit for the issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sub-limit for
swingline loans. Outstanding letters of credit on November 30, 2019 were $0.4 million. The Facility
contains affirmative and negative covenants, similar to the Term Loan B, including limitations on
additional debt, certain investments and acquisitions outside of the Company’s line of business. If the
average excess availability of the Facility falls below $25.0 million during any fiscal quarter, the Company
must then maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.1 to 1.0 as defined in the agreement.
Average excess availability is defined as the average daily amount available for borrowing under the
Facility during the Company’s fiscal quarter. The Company was in compliance with this requirement as the
average excess availability did not fall below $25.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.

Advances under the Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either an alternate base rate or a
eurodollar rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The alternate base interest rate is a fluctuating rate
equal to the higher of the prime rate or the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%. The
eurodollar rate is a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR. Applicable margins are based on the Company’s
average daily excess availability during the previous fiscal quarter. If average excess availability is greater
than $50.0 million, the applicable margin will be 1.50% on eurodollar loans and 0.50% on base rate

**Note L—Debt and Credit Lines (Continued)**

borrowings. If average excess availability is greater than or equal to $25.0 million but less than or equal to
$50.0 million, the applicable margin will be 1.75% on eurodollar loans and 0.75% on base rate borrowings.
If average excess availability is less than $25.0 million, the applicable margin will be 2.00% on eurodollar
loans and 1.00% on base rate borrowings. The commitment fee for unused credit lines will be 0.25% if
outstanding borrowings on the Facility are greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum revolver amount
and 0.375% if outstanding borrowings are less than 50% of the maximum revolver amount.

At November 30, 2019, there was $19.0 million borrowed under the Facility and the amount available for
borrowing was $32.1 million.

**_Eurodollar Revolving Loan_**

On May 31, 2018, the Company established a Eurodollar Revolving Loan (the ‘‘Revolver’’) with a potential
availability of A16.0 million to provide additional liquidity and working capital flexibility in Europe. The
terms of the Revolver are materially consistent with the Company’s U.S. Facility, including the maturity
date of August 26, 2021. The Company amended the Revolver effective June 14, 2019. Total borrowing
capacity of the Revolver was increased from A16.0 million to A25.0 million. This Revolver contains a
A9.0 million expansion feature the Company may exercise in the future to gain additional liquidity should
secured collateral of accounts receivable increase. At November 30, 2019 there were no amounts borrowed
under the Revolver and the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver was A19.0 million.

**_Other Debt_**

The Company maintains borrowing facilities at certain foreign subsidiaries, which consist of working
capital credit lines and facilities for the issuance of letters of credit. As of November 30, 2019, total
borrowing capacity for foreign working capital credit lines and letters of credit facilities were $12.1 million,
of which all was available for utilization. These letters of credit support commitments made in the ordinary
course of business.

**_Capital Lease Obligations_**

At November 30, 2019, the Company had assets under capital leases totaling $13.8 million, which are
included in property, plant, and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments for this capital lease together with
the present value of the net minimum lease payments as of November 30, 2019.

respectively. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a $40.0 million prepayment and
determined this constituted a partial extinguishment of debt and such, wrote-off $0.8 million of debt
issuance costs and original issue discounts.

**Note M—Employee Benefit Plans**

The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement
benefits for employees. These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’), local statutory law, or as determined by the
Board of Directors. The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
Pension plans are funded except for a U.S. non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and
certain foreign plans. The Company uses a November 30 measurement date for its plans.

**_Defined Benefit Plans_**

The Company’s defined benefit plans generally provide benefits based on years of service and
compensation for salaried employees and under negotiated non-wage based formulas for unionrepresented employees.

**_Assumptions_**

Weighted average assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit
plans as of November 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:


**Pension Plans**
**2019** **2018**


**Weighted Average Assumptions:**
Discount rate used for liability determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.07% 4.41%

**Note M—Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)**

Weighted average assumptions used to measure the net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s defined
benefit plans as of November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

**Pension Plans**
**2019** **2018** **2017**

**Weighted Average Assumptions:**
Discount rate used for expense determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.41% 3.66% 4.12%
Assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.68% 7.68% 7.68%
Annual rates of salary increase (non-U.S. plans) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.35% 3.47% 3.44%

The discount rate used for the liability determination reflects the current rate at which the pension
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used spot rates on a yield
curve matching benefit payments to determine the weighted average discount rate that would be applied in
determining the benefit obligation at November 30, 2019. The decrease in the discount rate used for
liability determination in 2019 is primarily due to a downward shift in the yield curve. The increase in the
discount rate used for expense determination in 2019 is due to a general increase in interest rates in the
current economic environment. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based
on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plans’ portfolios. The asset class
return is developed using historical asset return performance, as well as current market conditions, such as
inflation, interest rates, and equity market performance. The rate of compensation increase is based on
management’s estimates using historical experience and expected increases in rates.

**_Pension Plans Assets_**

The Company’s defined benefit plans are funded primarily through asset trusts or through general assets of
the Company. The Company employs a total return on investments approach for its U.S. defined benefit
pension plan assets. A mix of equity securities, fixed income securities, and collective trusts are used to
maximize the long-term rate of return on assets for the level of acceptable risk. Asset allocation at
November 30, 2019, target allocation for 2019, and expected long-term rate of return by asset category are
as follows:

Money market funds are valued at a net asset value (‘‘NAV’’) of $1.00 per share held by the plan at year
end, which approximates fair value.

Registered investment companies are valued at quoted market prices. The fair value of the participation
units owned by the Plan in the collective trust funds are based on the NAV of participating units held by
the Plan. Investments in real estate partnerships are valued at the fair value of the underlying assets based
on comparable sales value for similar assets, discounted cash flow models, appraisals, and other valuation
techniques.

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its
valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a
different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The following table summarizes the Plan’s investments with a reported NAV, which are measured at NAV
as a practical expedient to estimate fair value and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy as of
November 30, 2019 and 2018:

SEI Core Property Collective Investment Trust[(c)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $27.6 $25.8

(a) The SEI Structured Credit Collective Fund seeks to provide high general returns by investing in collateralized debt obligations
(‘‘CDO’s’’) and other structured credit instruments. This fund requires a two-year non-redemption period after which
investments can be redeemed at any time; however, a 90 day redemption notification period is required. The Plan has satisfied
all funding obligations related to this investment and has surpassed the two-year non-redemption period.

(b) The SEI Energy Debt Collective Investment Trust seeks to generate high total returns by primarily investing in debt securities
of U.S. and international energy companies denominated in U.S. dollars. This trust will invest in investment grade bonds, below
investment grade bonds, loans, rights issues, or equities of U.S. companies. Equity investments will be limited. In most cases,
equity investments will be attached to a debt investment for extending credit or if received in a restructuring, though the
Sub-Adviser is permitted to add-on to an existing equity position through a secondary market transaction.

(c) The SEI Core Property Collective Investment Trust, seeks both current income and long-term capital appreciation through
investing in underlying funds that acquire, manage, and dispose of commercial real estate properties. This trust expects to invest
at least 85% of its assets in open-end core underlying funds focused on properties in the U.S. with ‘‘core’’ meaning high-quality,
low-leveraged, income-generating office, industrial, retail, and multi-family properties, generally fully-leased to credit-worthy
companies and governmental entities. Up to 5% of this trust’s net assets may be invested in liquid real estate strategies
(publicly-traded REITs) for cash management purposes and the fund may have up to a 15% allocation to non-core sectors and
strategies.

**_Defined Contribution Plans_**

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan. Participation in this plan is available to
substantially all U.S. salaried employees and to certain groups of U.S. hourly employees. Company
contributions to this plan are based on either a percentage of employee contributions or on a specified
amount per hour based on the provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Contribution
expense to this plan was approximately $2.5 million in 2019, $2.6 million in 2018, and $2.6 million in 2017.
The defined contribution 401(k) plan contained approximately 0.6 million and 0.7 million of the
Company’s common shares at November 30, 2019 and November 30, 2018, respectively.

**_Health Care Plans_**

The Company provides retiree medical plans for certain retired U.S. employees of which there were 46
retired participants as of November 30, 2019. The plan is frozen to new participants. The plans generally
provide for cost sharing in the form of retiree contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance between the
Company and its retirees, and a fixed cost cap on the amount the Company pays annually to provide future
retiree medical coverage. For 2019, the Company reduced its exposure to liability under these plans by

fully insuring benefits for a significant number of plan participants. For the remaining participants, these
post-retirement benefits are unfunded. All benefits were accrued by the date the employee become eligible
for benefits. Retirees in certain other countries are provided similar benefits by plans sponsored by local
governments.

The Company expects to record non-cash retiree medical health care reduction of expenses of
approximately $0.6 million in 2020.

**_Assumptions_**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

**Weighted Average Assumptions:**
Discount rate used for liability determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.00% 4.41% 3.62%
Discount rate used for expense determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.41% 3.62% 4.00%

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the retiree medical liabilities could be effectively
settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used spot rates on a yield curve matching benefit payments
to determine the weighted average discount rate that would be applied in determining the benefit
obligation at November 30, 2019. Because the Company’s retiree health care benefits are capped, assumed
health care cost trend rates have a minimal effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care
plans. A 1% increase or decrease in the current health care cost trend rate would have an impact of less
than $0.1 million on net periodic cost and the benefit obligation.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

China Customs Matter. In December 2019, the China Customs office in Shanghai notified the Company
that it intended to issue a finding that the Company had previously used an incorrect customs code in
connection with exports from China in respect of a small product line. As a result, the local Shanghai
taxing authority may seek to recoup certain value added tax (‘‘VAT’’) refunds previously received by the
Company in respect of the exported products. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position if a
proceeding is initiated. As of November 30, 2019, the Company does not have sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the amount of possible recoupment of historical VAT refunds and related amounts
which may be payable, if any. Accordingly, no provision related to this matter has been recorded in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements as of November 30, 2019.

Other Matters. From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims, proceedings, and lawsuits
related to products, services, contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property, and other
matters. The ultimate resolution of such claims, proceedings, and lawsuits is inherently unpredictable and,
as a result, the Company’s estimates of liability, if any, are subject to change. Actual results may materially
differ from the Company’s estimates and an unfavorable resolution of any matter could have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows of the Company. However,
subject to the above and taking into account such amounts, if any, as are accrued from time to time on the
Company’s balance sheet, the Company does not believe, based on the information currently available to
it, that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material effect on the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

**_Leases_**

The Company leases certain facilities, machinery and equipment, and office buildings under long-term,
non-cancelable operating leases. The leases generally provide for renewal options ranging from 5 to
20 years and require the Company to pay for utilities, insurance, taxes, and maintenance. Lease expense on
operating leases was $5.7 million in 2019, $5.7 million in 2018, and $6.2 million in 2017. Future minimum
commitments at November 30, 2019 for non-cancelable operating leases were $16.0 million with annual
amounts of $4.2 million in 2020, $2.8 million in 2021, $2.3 million in 2022, $1.5 million in 2023, $0.8 million
in 2024, and $4.4 million for leases thereafter.

**_Environmental Matters_**

The Company’s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of
the environment. The Company devotes significant resources and management attention to comply with
environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 30,
2019 and 2018 reflects reserves for environmental remediation of $1.4 million and $1.5 million,
respectively. The Company’s estimates are subject to change and actual results may materially differ from
the Company’s estimates. Management believes, on the basis of presently available information, that
resolution of known environmental matters will not materially affect liquidity, capital resources, or the
financial condition of the Company.

**_Collective Bargaining Agreements_**

At November 30, 2019, the Company employed approximately 1,850 employees at offices, plants, and other
facilities located principally throughout the United States, France, China, Portugal and Thailand.
Approximately 12% of the Company’s U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements of
which approximately 20 employees are covered by agreements that expire within the next 12 months. In
addition, certain of our foreign employees are also covered by collective bargaining agreements.

**Note O—Share-Based Compensation Plans**

The Company provides compensation benefits to employees under the OMNOVA Solutions 2017 Equity
Incentive Plan (the ‘‘Plan’’), which was approved by shareholders on March 22, 2017. The Plan permits the
Company to grant to officers, key employees and non-employee directors of the Company, incentives
directly linked to the price of OMNOVA Solutions’ common shares. The Plan authorizes the issuance of
Company common shares in the aggregate for (a) awards of options rights to purchase Company common
shares, (b) performance shares and performance units, (c) restricted shares, (d) restricted share units, or
(e) appreciation rights. Shares granted under the Plan may be either newly issued shares or treasury shares
or both. As of November 30, 2019, approximately 1.1 million Company common shares remained available
for grants under the Plan. All options granted under the Plan are granted at exercise prices equal to the
market value of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. Additionally, the Plan provides that
the term of any option granted under the Plan may not exceed 10 years.

During the year ended November 30, 2019, the Company granted performance share awards (‘‘PSA’s’’) to
its executive officers. The PSA’s provide recipients the right to receive the Company’s common shares if
specified performance goals, including a performance goal relative to peers, are met over a three fiscal
year measurement period. Each grantee receives a target grant of PSA’s, but may earn between 0% and
200% (or in the case of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, between 0% and 143%) of the target grant
depending on the Company’s performance against the stated performance goals. The estimated fair value
of performance share units granted is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common shares
at each reporting period and recorded based on achievement of target performance metrics.

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award,
and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The fair
value of restricted share awards (‘‘RSA’s’’) and restricted share units (‘‘RSU’s’’) is determined based on the
closing market price of the Company’s common shares at the date of grant. RSU’s entitle the holder to
receive one ordinary share for each RSU at vesting, generally over a three year period from the date of
grant. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately

realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the
reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company.

A summary of the Company’s restricted share and restricted share units activity and related information
for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:

Compensation expense for all share-based payments included in general and administrative expense was
$2.0 million, $2.8 million, and $1.9 million during 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

As of November 30, 2019, there was $3.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to
non-vested share-based compensation arrangements to be amortized over a weighted average remaining
period of less than 2.0 years.

The Company also provides employees the opportunity to purchase Company common shares through
payroll deductions under the OMNOVA Solutions Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ‘‘ESPP’’). Under
the ESPP, eligible employees receive a 15% discount from the trading value of common shares purchased.
The purchase price for common shares purchased from the Company will be 85% of the closing price of
the common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (‘‘NYSE’’) on the investment date. Participants may
contribute funds to the ESPP, not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars in any calendar year. If a
participant terminates his or her employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, the participant’s
participation will immediately terminate and the participant’s account will be converted to a regular
brokerage account. As of November 30, 2019 the amount of shares held by eligible participants through
the ESPP was not material.

**Note P—Business Segment Information**

The Company’s two reporting segments are Specialty Solutions and Performance Materials. These two
reporting segments were determined based on products and services provided as defined under FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’) 280, Segment Reporting. Accounting policies of the segments
are the same as the Company’s accounting policies. The Company’s reporting segments are strategic
business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately based on certain
differences in their operations, technology, and marketing strategies.

Segment operating profit represents net sales less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for
restructuring and severance costs, asset write-offs and acquisition and integration related expenses relating
to operations. However, Management excludes restructuring and severance costs, asset write-offs and
acquisition and integration related costs when evaluating the results and allocating resources to the
segments.

Segment operating profit excludes certain unallocated corporate headquarters expenses. Corporate
headquarters expense includes the cost of providing and maintaining the corporate headquarters functions,
including salaries, rent, travel and entertainment expenses, depreciation, utility costs, outside services and
amortization of deferred financing costs.

In 2019, segment operating profit for Specialty Solutions includes restructuring and severance charges of
$0.4 million and acquisition integration related expense of $0.3 million, while Performance Materials
segment operating profit includes restructuring and severance charges of $2.2 million, asset impairment
and facility closure costs of $10.7 million, gain on sale of assets of $4.4 million, and accelerated
depreciation of $1.1 million.

**Note Q—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements**

_Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies_

The Company is exposed primarily to credit, interest rate, and foreign currency rate risks, which arise in
the normal course of business.

_Credit Risk_

Credit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a customer or counterparty to settle
its financial and contractual obligations with the Company as and when they fall due. The primary credit
risk for the Company is its accounts receivable and notes receivable, which are generally unsecured. The
Company has established credit limits for customers and monitors their balances to mitigate its risk of loss.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are generally limited due to the wide
variety of customers and markets using the Company’s products. There was no single customer who
represented more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended November 30,
2019 and 2018. There was one Performance Materials’ customer that represented approximately 10% of
the Company’s consolidated net sales during the years ended November 30, 2017. There was no single
customer who represented more than 10% of the Company’s net trade receivables at November 30, 2019
or 2018.

_Interest Rate Risk_

The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s
$350.0 million Term Loan B, Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and various foreign subsidiary
borrowings, which bear interest at variable rates, approximating market interest rates. The Term Loan B
has a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. As of November 30, 2019, the LIBOR rate applicable to the Term Loan B
was 1.74%.

**Note Q—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)**

_Foreign Currency Rate Risk_

The Company incurs foreign currency risk on sales and purchases denominated in other than the
functional currency. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Euro, Great Britain Pound
Sterling, Renminbi, and Thai Baht.

Foreign currency exchange contracts are used by the Company to manage risks from the change in market
exchange rates on cash payments by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and U.S. Dollar cash holdings in
foreign locations. These forward contracts are used on a continuing basis for periods of approximately
thirty days, consistent with the underlying hedged transactions. Hedging limits the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements on the Company’s operating results. The counterparties to these instruments are
investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any non-performance. The
Company maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly
monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased or sold for trading
purposes. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these
instruments are recognized in earnings immediately. Net losses on foreign currency contracts that were
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, as a component of other income, were $0.2 million
for the year ended November 30, 2019. Net gains on foreign currency contracts for the year ended
November 30, 2018 were $1.0 million.

_Derivative Instruments_

The Company recognizes the fair value of qualifying derivative instruments as either an asset or a liability
within its statement of financial position. For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the change
in fair value of the derivative is recognized in earnings each reporting period. The Company defines fair
value as the price that would be received to transfer an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a
hierarchy of valuation inputs to measure fair value.

The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels:

Level 1 inputs—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 inputs—Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by
market data.

Level 3 inputs—Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position are as follows:

**Other** **Other**
**Notional** **Current** **Current** **Type of**
**Amount** **Assets** **Liabilities** **Hedge** **Term**

_Fair Value Measurements_

The Company uses the market approach and the income approach to value assets and liabilities as
appropriate. The model uses Level 2 market observable inputs including currency spot prices. The

During fiscal year 2019 and 2018, the Company did not record any material other-than-temporary
impairments on financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

The Company measures the fair value of its foreign exchange forward contracts using month-end currency
spot prices.

In connection with the Creole acquisition, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability with
a fair value of $1.0 million as of November 30, 2017. As of November 30, 2019, this contingent
consideration liability has expired. Changes in expected value are recognized in other income within the
consolidated statements of operations. Under the contingent consideration agreement, the amounts to be
paid are based upon actual financial results of the acquired product sales over a two-year period. The fair
value of the contingent consideration is a Level 3 valuation and fair valued using a probability weighted
discounted cash flow analysis. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during 2019 or 2018.

The fair value of the Company’s Term Loan B at November 30, 2019 approximated $298.2 million, which is
less than the book value of $298.6 million as a result of prevailing market rates on the Company’s debt.
The fair value of the Term Loan B is based on market price information and is measured using the last
available trade of the instrument on a secondary market in each respective period and therefore is
considered a Level 2 measurement. The fair value is not indicative of the amount that the Company would
have to pay to redeem these instruments since they are infrequently traded and are not callable at this
value. The carrying value of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility approximates fair value. The fair
value of the Company’s capital lease obligation approximates its carrying amount based on estimated
borrowing rates to discount the cash flows to their present value.

**Note R—Treasury Stock Purchases**

On September 25, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$20.0 million of the Company’s common shares, which authorization expires upon the completion of the
$20.0 million in repurchases. The Company may use various methods to make the repurchases, including
open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, or open market solicitations for shares. Because
the Company has not adopted a Rule 10b5-1 plan for these repurchases, repurchases may only be made
during open window periods depending upon relevant factors including market or business conditions.
Repurchases may be discontinued at any time.

The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2019 or 2018 under an approved plan. Pursuant to the
Company’s Merger Agreement with Synthomer, the Company is prohibited from executing share
repurchases under the plan. Shares acquired during 2019 or 2018 resulted from common shares deemed
surrendered by employees in connection with the Company’s equity compensation and benefit plans to
satisfy employee income tax obligations upon vesting.

**Note S—Acquisitions**

**_Resiquimica_**

On September 25, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Resiquimica S.A. and
certain related entities (‘‘Resiquimica’’) from Socer—Imobiliaria e Investimentos, S.A. Resiquimica is a
Portugal-based producer of polymers and resins for coatings and construction applications in Europe,
Middle East and Africa (‘‘EMEA’’). Resiquimica, with approximately A56.0 million in annual sales, brings
new technology, expanded product portfolio and a manufacturing base in Sintra, Portugal, which will
provide production flexibility in the EMEA region. The total purchase price for Resiquimica was
A21.8 million ($25.6 million), net of acquired cash plus debt assumed of $9.8 million. Cash payments were
primarily funded with cash on hand and borrowings on the Facility. Of the total purchase price,
$22.8 million was paid in fiscal 2018, and $2.8 million was paid subsequently in December 2018.
Resiquimica’s results are included within the Specialty Solutions segment. The debt assumed was
subsequently paid in full and the related cash flows are reflected as financing cash flows within the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The information included herein has been prepared based on the allocation of the purchase price using
estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which were determined with the
assistance of independent valuations using discounted cash flow and comparative market multiple
approaches, quoted market prices and estimates made by management. The purchase price allocation is
subject to further adjustment until all pertinent information regarding the assets and liabilities acquired
are fully evaluated by the Company, not to exceed one year as permitted under ASC 805, Business
Combinations.

The Company recorded acquired intangible assets of $3.5 million, with an estimated weighted-average
useful life of 9.1 years. These intangible assets include customer lists of $1.1 million, technical know-how of
$0.9 million, and trademarks of $1.5 million, with estimated weighted-average useful lives ranging from 7
to 10 years.

The Company incurred $2.1 million of acquisition-related costs for Resiquimica, which have been included
in acquisition and integration related expense within the consolidated statements of operations. The gross
contractual amount of accounts receivable acquired was $20.3 million. The Company repaid the acquired
debt of $9.8 million within 60 days of the acquisition date.

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed in the acquisition, and represents the future economic benefits arising
from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The amount
allocated to goodwill is primarily the result of anticipated synergies resulting from the consolidation of
sales, logistics, and purchasing activities, as well as the elimination of duplicate administrative costs. This
goodwill has been allocated to the Company’s Specialty Solutions segment and is not deductible for
income tax purposes.
