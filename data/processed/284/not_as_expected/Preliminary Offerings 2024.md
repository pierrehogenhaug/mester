would be unlawful.

The materials relating to the Offering (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) do not constitute, and may not

law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any of the Initial

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they
form part of UK domestic law by virtue of EUWA or have been implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted
via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none
of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the Guarantors (each as defined
in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, accepts
any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum

from any Initial Purchaser.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties
(“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such
securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The Notes (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) are not**
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK**


-----

has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to completion and
amendment (which may be material) without notice. The definitive terms of the transaction will be described in
the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to,
constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as,
or in connection with, any offer or invitation to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities
described therein.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant to
an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the
Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded),
and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU Member State”) of the European
Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so
in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes
through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final
placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as


-----

amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10)**
of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any
EU Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms
of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes,
as the same may be varied in that EU Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Regulation in
that EU Member State.

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each
manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, persons who (i) are outside the
United Kingdom, (ii) are investment professionals, as such term is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion
**Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iv) are**
persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment banking activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of
any Notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and
must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity
to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum
or any of its contents.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This
Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the
“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK**
has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.


-----

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined
in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
**Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the**
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**ESG RATINGS**

Our exposure to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) risks and the related management arrangements
established to address or mitigate those risks have been and may be assessed by third-party organizations, among
other ways, through ESG scores or ratings (“ESG ratings”). The ESG ratings are prepared pursuant to proprietary
reference frameworks that may not be fully defined or explained, may not be standardized across those third-party
organizations, and may not be recognized by all stakeholders. We have an AA” ESG rating from MSCI, a CDP
Climate score of A- (Leadership Category), a “Green Economy” mark (which is awarded by the London Stock
Exchange to companies that earn more than 50% of our revenue from products that contribute to environmental
objectives), and a silver rating from EcoVadis (a provider of business sustainability ratings) (together, the “ESG
**Risk Ratings”).**

The ESG Risk Ratings are not investment advice and should not be considered to constitute or comprise part of
an offer, solicitation or advice to buy or sell or otherwise invest in any securities. This offering memorandum
contains information developed by MSCI, CDP and EcoVadis. Such information and data are proprietary to
MSCI, CDP and EcoVadis, as applicable, and/or their relevant third-party suppliers, are provided for
informational purposes only and do not constitute an endorsement of any product or project, nor investment advice
and are not warranted to be complete, timely, accurate or suitable for a particular purpose. MSCI, CDP and
EcoVadis are not subject to any regulatory or other similar oversight in respect of their methodology or ratings
determinations. ESG ratings may vary amongst ESG ratings organizations as the methodologies and priorities
used to determine ESG ratings may differ. The ESG Risk Ratings are not necessarily indicative of our current or
future operating or financial performance, or our future ability to service the Notes. The ESG Risk Ratings are
expressed as of the date on which they were initially issued and are subject to withdrawal, suspension or change


-----

at any time. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of such ESG Risk Ratings
contained in this offering memorandum or elsewhere in making an investment decision. Each of the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates makes no representations as to the accuracy or validity of the ESG Risk Ratings
and assumes no liability with respect to the consequences of any reliance that may be placed on this information.
Please also refer to section “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes and the Notes Guarantee—ESG Risk
_Ratings—The third-party ESG Ratings, referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately reflect our_
_risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency or_
_underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from_
_investors, lenders and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes.” For more_
information regarding the assessment methodologies used to determine ESG ratings, please refer to the relevant
ESG ratings agency’s website (which website does not form a part of, nor is incorporated by reference in, this
offering memorandum). In addition, this offering memorandum includes our relative ESG position among other
companies within our industry as ranked by MSCI, CDP and EcoVadis. In certain cases, the rankings may be
based on only publicly available information and in other cases may be based on information supplied by the
relevant companies. As such, the quality of information in respect of each company included in our rankings may
not be comparable and there may therefore be limitations on the utility of these rankings. Prospective investors
should consider these limitations carefully.

operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate. New risks can
emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all
such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and
uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

not intend, and do not undertake any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from:

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer plc and its consolidated subsidiaries and
related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Consolidated Financial
**Statements”);**

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer plc and its consolidated subsidiaries and
related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the unaudited
comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021) (the “2022 Consolidated
**Financial Statements”); and**

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of Synthomer plc and its consolidated subsidiaries and
related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the unaudited
comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022) (the “2023 Consolidated
**Financial Statements” and, together with the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2022**
Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The Consolidated Financial Statements were, in each case, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting
under those standards (“IFRS”). The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in pounds sterling.
Synthomer has a December financial year end.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The financial
statements of the Issuer (as a standalone entity) as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022
and 2023 have not been included in this Offering Memorandum. The Consolidated Financial Statements should
be read in conjunction with the relevant reports of our independent auditors, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, as such reports relate to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a complete description of the
basis of preparation and significant accounting policies followed in preparing the Consolidated Financial
Statements, see Note 2 of the notes to each of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations.”_

The preparation of financial information in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
judgments and estimates. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of_ _Operations—Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates, Judgements and Assumptions”_
and Note 2 (Significant accounting policies) of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial information are disclosed in the notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

On September 29, 2023, we announced our intention to shut down our North America Paper and Carpet Business
before the end of 2023, as part of our previously announced strategy to exit a number of non-core businesses,
including the paper and carpet businesses globally. This triggered the classification of the North America Paper
and Carpet Business as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in the 2023 Consolidated Financial
Statements (including the 2022 comparative financial information presented therein) as the approved plan and
announcement to divest the North America Paper and Carpet Business represented a major line of business
discontinuation under IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (“IFRS 5”). See
Note 30 (Discontinued operations) to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.


-----

On December 13, 2022, we announced an agreement to divest our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics
Businesses to Surteco North America, Inc. and completed the disposal on February 28, 2023. The final net cash
proceeds received at completion amounted to $262 million, and were used to repay existing debt, with a further
$5 million receivable in cash on the 13-month anniversary of completion and other working capital settlement
related receivable and remaining transaction costs payable, resulting in total net proceeds of $269.0 million. The
sale of our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Business triggered the classification of these assets as
discontinued operations and assets held for sale in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements (including the
2021 comparative financial information presented therein) as the approved plan and announcement to divest the
Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses represented a major line of business discontinuation under IFRS
5. See Note 31 (Discontinued operations) to the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 30 (
_Discontinued operations) to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

On April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business for a total consideration of
£779.1 million. The 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and the financial information derived therefrom
reflect the consolidated financial information of the Group, including the Adhesive Resins Business subsequent
to the completion date of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business and may therefore not be directly
comparable with the consolidated financial information as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021
and 2023 presented in this Offering Memorandum.

The discussion of financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is primarily based on Synthomer’s
Underlying performance, which represents our statutory performance under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special
Items, as discussed further below under “—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”

The Synthomer financial information included in this Offering Memorandum does not and is not intended to
comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder.

**New and amended standards adopted by the group**

There are no standards or interpretations that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material
impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions. See Note 3
to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included references to certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including
Underlying performance, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, capital expenditures, working capital, net debt, free cash
flow, as adjusted net borrowings (including lease liabilities), as adjusted finance costs, the ratio of as adjusted
net borrowings (including lease liabilities) to EBITDA and the ratio of EBITDA to _as adjusted finance costs._
None of these non-IFRS measures and ratios should be construed as an alternative to any IFRS measure such as
revenue, operating profit/(loss), profit/(loss) for the year or net cash flow from operating activities. References to
EBITDA in this Offering Memorandum are to Underlying EBITDA unless otherwise specified.

We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items. We believe that
EBITDA provides useful information to investors about our results of operations because they are among the
measures used by our board of directors (“Board”) and management to evaluate our Underlying operating
performance, review business trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating
decisions, and they allow a comparison of our results across periods on a consistent basis by removing the effects
on our operating performance of our capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset base
and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and items largely outside the control of
management (such as income taxes). Accordingly, such measures are reported within our annual reports and half
year reports. In addition, you should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this
presentation in the future and that certain of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Our presentation
of EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or
irregular items. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of our operating
performance in accordance with IFRS. Unless otherwise stated, EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum
is from continuing operations.


-----

We define Underlying performance as the statutory performance of Synthomer under IFRS, excluding the effect
of Special Items (as defined below).

We define capital expenditures as the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets as recorded
on our consolidated cash flow statement.

We define net debt as total current (including bank overdrafts) and non-current borrowings, less cash and cash
equivalents.

We define working capital as inventories plus trade and other receivables less trade and other payables.

We define free cash flow as a movement in net debt before financing activities, foreign exchange and other
movement and the cash impact of Special Items, asset disposals and business combinations.

When reviewing performance, the directors and management use a combination of both IFRS and non-IFRS
(Underlying) performance measures. The Underlying performance measures provide additional information in
line with how financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. We believe that nonIFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ongoing operations and of our ability to service our indebtedness and
can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You should exercise
caution in comparing the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other companies. NonIFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. For example, EBITDA has limitations
including the following: (i) it does not reflect our capital expenditures or capitalized development costs, our future
requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) it does not reflect changes in, or cash
requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) it does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements
necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization
are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and
EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements.

The discussion of financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is primarily based on our
Underlying performance, which represents our statutory performance under IFRS, excluding the effect of Special
Items (as defined below).

The definition of Special Items has been consistently applied across the periods presented in this Offering
Memorandum. Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of the business’s
performance would lead to a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure our consolidated
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the business in
the year, or both. The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a more
clear indication of our Underlying performance:

- restructuring and site closure costs;

- sale of a business or significant asset;

- acquisition costs;

- amortization of acquired intangible assets;

- impairment of non-current assets;

- fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments where hedge accounting is not
applied;

- items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature;

- tax impact of above items; and

- settlement of prior period tax issues.


-----

We believe that presenting “Underlying performance” as an alternative performance measure provides additional
clarity for our investors and stakeholders on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses and it is the
primary focus of Synthomer’s narrative reporting.

The non-IFRS financial measures and ratios of Synthomer included in this Offering Memorandum are not
intended to comply with reporting requirements of the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or
the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither
the assumptions underlying the related adjustments nor the resulting unaudited as adjusted financial data have
been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**UNAUDITED AS ADJUSTED FINANCIAL DATA**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited _as adjusted financial data which is based on our_
consolidated financial information, as adjusted to give effect to the Offering, including the application of the net
proceeds therefrom, as they had occurred on December 31, 2023 (in the case of balance sheet information) or
January 1, 2023 (in the case of profit or loss information). The unaudited as adjusted financial data has not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus
Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the related
adjustments nor the resulting unaudited as adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed in accordance
with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**MARKET DATA**

Information regarding macroeconomic trends, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to
our business contained in this Offering Memorandum consists, with certain exceptions, of estimates based on data
compiled by professional organizations and analysts, of data from other external sources and of our knowledge of
our market. These data are subject to change and cannot be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the
availability and reliability of the raw data and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey.
In particular, in this Offering Memorandum in the section entitled “Industry Overview,” we have cited certain
reports and surveys by Kline, INDA, Edana, KNG Global Paints & Coatings, IPPIC Global Market Analysis and
Advancy. The analysts compiling these reports and surveys based their estimates and conclusions on a variety of
different sources, some of which may be more accurate or reliable than others. Thus, our market share estimates,
calculated using our internal customer records, and data of our competitors published by third parties, may differ
from third-party analyst estimates of our market share. We cannot provide any assurance that customer numbers
of our competitors in such analyst reports are correct or the same as those contained in our competitors’ internal
records. Therefore, you should use caution in analyzing these estimates and should not place undue reliance on
them.

Where information has been sourced from a third party, such information has been accurately reproduced and as
far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information published by such third party, no facts have been
omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, you should keep in
mind that we have not independently verified information we have obtained from any third-party sources.

**ROUNDING**

Certain figures included in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
thousands, certain operating data, percentages and other data, have been subject to rounding adjustments;
accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown
as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures which precede them. Percentages
and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other information set out in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using
the numerical information in “Selected Financial Information” or the tabular presentation of other information
(subject to rounding) set out in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical information
in the narrative description thereof.

**Overview**

We are a high-performance, highly specialized polymers and ingredients company with strong geographic
diversity and product differentiation focused on a wide range of markets through our three end-customer facing
divisions: coatings and construction; adhesives; and health and protection. Speciality chemicals are value-add
products manufactured using polymerization and other reactive processes to transform commodity raw materials
into polymers and other complex chemical outputs that are used by customers in a variety of downstream
industries including the healthcare, consumer goods and construction sectors. End products for our speciality
chemicals include, but are not limited to, medical gloves, tires and rubber modifiers, artificial turf and carpet
backing, mattresses, food packaging, coatings and adhesives. We had revenue from continuing operations of
£1,970.9 million and EBITDA of £142.1 million from continuing operations for the year ended December 31,
2023.

From January 1, 2023, we have operated through the following three divisions or reportable segments:

  - _Coatings & Construction Solutions focuses on enhancing the sustainable performance of a wide range_
of coatings and construction products, with a total addressable market of more than £9 billion covering
architectural and masonry coatings, mortar modification, waterproofing and flooring, fiber bonding, gel
foam elastomers and energy solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Coatings & Construction
Solutions had revenue of £815.5 million, with EBITDA of £100.1 million and underlying operating profit
of £73.3 million from continuing operations.

  - _Adhesive Solutions focuses on the solutions needed to bond, modify and compatibilize surfaces and_
components for products including tapes and labels, packaging, hygiene, building and construction, tires
and plastic modification, with a total addressable market of approximately $12 billion, helping improve
the permeability, strength, elasticity, damping, dispersion and grip of these end products. For the year
ended December 31, 2023, Adhesive Solutions had revenue of £581.7 million, with EBITDA of £31.2
million and underlying operating loss of £7.5 million from continuing operations.

  - _Health & Protection and Performance Materials focuses on the enhancement of the protection and_
performance of goods across a wide range of industries including medical glove manufacture, speciality
paper, food packaging, carpet and artificial turf, with a total addressable market of more than £4 billion.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, Health & Protection and Performance Materials had revenue of
£573.7 million, with EBITDA of £31.0 million and underlying operating loss of £0.7 million from
continuing operations.

Up until December 31, 2022, we operated and reported through five global operational business segments:

  - _Functional Solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2022 (the last year during which we reported_
such segment), Functional Solutions had revenue of £1,001.3 million, with EBITDA of £127.8 million
and underlying operating profit of £101.1 million from continuing operations.

  - _Industrial Specialities. For the year ended December 31, 2022 (the last year during which we reported_

  - _Adhesive Technologies. For the year ended December 31, 2022 (the last year during which we reported_
such segment), Adhesive Technologies had revenue of £391.3 million, with EBITDA of £39.5 million
and underlying operating profit of £22.5 million from continuing operations.

  - _Performance Elastomers. For the year ended December 31, 2022 (the last year during which we reported_
such segment), Performance Elastomers had revenue of £659.7 million, with EBITDA of £49.1 million
and underlying operating profit of £19.5 million from continuing operations.

  - _Acrylate Monomers. For the year ended December 31, 2022 (the last year during which we reported such_
segment), Acrylate Monomers had revenue of £97.7 million, with EBITDA of £21.7 million and
underlying operating profit of £20.6 million from continuing operations.

As of December 31, 2023, we served over 6,000 customers through our three divisions, currently supported by
the operation of 36 manufacturing sites (with another announced closure underway) in 17 countries, including
four innovation Centers of Excellence that form part of the broader network of 12 technical centers, and
approximately 4,200 employees globally.

**Our Strengths**

We believe that the following are among our key competitive strengths:

**_Global speciality chemicals company with leading positions in our markets_**

We are a global speciality chemicals company and one of the world’s leading suppliers of water-based polymers,
with a number of our product types holding market-leading positions globally, as well as more specifically in
Europe, the United States and the Middle East. As a speciality chemicals producer, we channel our technical
expertise and customer and end-market knowledge to help our customers develop a diverse variety of end
products, including medical gloves, tires and rubber modifiers, artificial turf and carpet backing, mattresses, food
packaging, coatings, adhesives and other end products. Our long-term customer partners benefit from our
knowledge and understanding of their technical needs, our customer service and our R&D, which has allowed us
to develop innovative solutions that help our customers' business.

As of January 1, 2023, we reorganized our divisional structure along three market-focused divisions, to better
serve our end-market customers, comprised of (i) Coatings & Construction Solutions, (ii) Adhesive Solutions and
(iii) Health & Protection and Performance Materials. We consider both of the Coatings & Construction Solutions
and Adhesive Solutions divisions to constitute the core strategic growth areas of our business, while the Health &
Protection and Performance Materials division includes our NBR base business, specializing in products that are
used in the manufacture of dipped products for medical, industrial and household applications, including
protective gloves, as well as our non-core businesses. See “Business—Customers and End Markets—End
_Markets.”_

Our Coatings & Construction Solutions division brings together a range of our businesses focused on the coatings
and construction end-markets, reflecting our desire to strengthen our positioning within these markets and to
improve our portfolio through sustainability-focused innovation and customer value propositions. It is currently
our largest division in terms of both continuing revenue and EBITDA contribution and we are one of the leading
suppliers in Europe across each of our key coatings and construction product ranges.

Our Adhesive Solutions division has one of the broadest offerings of adhesive solutions products in the industry,
with leading manufacturing positions in Europe, the United States and the Middle East across all tackifier product
groups.

Our Health & Protection and Performance Materials division includes products that enhance protection and
performance in a wide range of industries. Globally, we are the second largest producer of NBR latex by volume,
which our customers use in the manufacturing of, among other things, medical gloves.

(1)   In Oil & Gas.

(2)   The presented sector sizes do not represent all sectors included in the total addressable market for each division.

**_Attractive end markets aligned to long term growth megatrends_**

While the level of demand for each of our product types and in each of our end markets is affected by factors
specific to that product type and that particular end market, certain overarching global trends have an impact
across our product types and end markets. These include (i) accelerating urbanization resulting in migration from
urban areas to cities and an increase in infrastructure developments, (ii) demographic changes and social changes,
such as an ageing population and a growing middle class in certain emerging markets, (iii) increased focus on
climate change and sustainability, including the impact of an increasing global focus on energy reduction and
more sustainable products, which in turn increases demand for lower carbon products more circular products as
well as adaptive products for a wider variety of weather conditions and (iv) a shifting economic center of gravity
toward Asia.

We believe that these global macroeconomic trends, when combined with specific growth drivers within each of
our end markets and the nuanced strategic initiatives within each of our three divisions, contribute to the expected
growth of our business in excess of GDP.

_Coatings & Construction Solutions_

We expect both of the coating and construction end markets we serve from our Coatings & Construction Solutions
division to grow in excess of global GDP, as our focused strategy allows us to access end-markets growing in
excess of global GDP, supported by specific end-market growth drivers. Within the coating end market, we see
both an increased customer appetite for water-based coatings that replace or remove the need for harmful organic
solvents as well as revenue synergies derived from our previous acquisitions. Within the construction end market,
favorable global macroeconomic trends, such as increased urbanization and a growing middle class within urban
areas, as well as the professionalization of the construction business are driving long-term increases in demand
for our products. Further, this increase in demand is augmented by a healthy innovation pipeline of new products
to provide a wide range of solutions for our customers.

We aim to leverage these growth drivers as part of our division-wide strategy to (i) improve our geographical
balance by focusing on growing markets in Asia and the Americas, (ii) optimize our asset base and expand network
efficiency projects, (iii) improve our product portfolio through more sustainable innovation derived from our
wealth of end market experience to provide customer value and (iv) improving our cost control and capacity
management on a division-wide basis.

_Adhesive Solutions_

We expect the adhesives end market we serve through our Adhesive Solutions division to grow in excess of global
GDP, as our focused strategy allows us to access end-markets growing in excess of global GDP, supported by as
specific end-market growth drivers. Our Adhesive Solutions division benefits from long-term relationships with
over 700 customers who sell products in more than 1000 locations throughout the world, which gives us significant
insight into the constantly evolving demands of our customers and fuels a healthy innovation pipeline of new
products to provide a wide range of solutions for our customers. In addition, we continue to derive revenue
synergies following our acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business.

We aim to leverage these growth drivers as part of our division-wide strategy to (i) broaden our supply of raw
materials to improve asset and supply chain reliability, (ii) deliver additional production capacity through
debottlenecking projects and operational efficiency initiatives, (iii) refine our capital allocation to reprioritize
capital expenditure within the Adhesive Solutions division and (iv) improving our cost control and efficiency by
reducing working capital on a division-wide basis.

_Health & Protection and Performance Materials_

We expect the health & protection end market we serve from through our Health & Protection and Performance
Materials division to grow in excess of global GDP, as our focused strategy allows us to access end-markets
growing in excess of global GDP, supported by as specific end-market growth drivers s. Our Health & Protection
and Performance Materials division benefits from favorable global macroeconomic trends as well as focused
process improvements and disciplined investments in proprietary technology.

We aim to leverage these growth drivers with as part of our division-wide strategy to (i) continue innovating with
our processes to drive efficiency, (ii) deliver increased cost competitiveness within our Malaysian supply chain,
(iii) fostering intimate customer relationships and (iv) further divesting non-core assets from our portfolio.

**_Long standing, collaborative relationships with blue chip customer base_**

As of December 31, 2023, we have 36 manufacturing sites (with another announced closure underway) across 17
countries in the Europe, North America and Asia, resulting in a balanced geographic footprint with 49.8% of
revenues generated in Europe, 25.3% in North America, 17.4% in Asia and 7.5% in the rest of the world.

We served approximately 6,000 customers across the world in the year ended December 31, 2023, including many
global blue-chip companies. We believe we have strong and long-term customer relationships, with an average
length of 13-15 years. Our customer base is diversified and well-balanced across geographies and end markets.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, our largest customer represented approximately 3% of revenues from
continuing operations while revenues from our twenty largest customers represented approximately 24% of
revenues from continuing operations.

Some examples of key customers include: (i) with respect to Coatings & Construction Solutions, PPG Industries,
Inc., Baker Hughes, Akzo Nobel N.V., Sika AG, Proctor & Gamble Company and Haliburton Company; (ii) with
respect to Adhesive Solutions, Henkel Ltd, HB Fuller Company, Sherwin Williams Company, Pirelli & C. S.p.A.
and Continental AG; and (iii) with respect to Health & Protection and Performance Materials, Top Glove
Corporation Bhd, Sappi Limited, Riverstone Holdings Limited, Fomosa Plastics and the Condor Group.

**_Global manufacturing footprint with further simplification of asset base underway_**

We have a global manufacturing footprint utilizing state-of-the-art technology underpinned by our long-term
investment program in strategic sites. We have 36 manufacturing plans across EMEA, North America and Asia,
with 20 production facilities across Europe and the Middle East, nine production in North America and seven sites
in Asia. Given that many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content,
transportation and storage of these products can be costly due to the size and weight of water-based products as
well as the hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals. We therefore benefit from our asset base being
located in close proximity to many of our customers.

Our asset base enables us to optimize production across our facilities, such as transferring products from one plant
to another to better match customer requirements, without the need to invest in significant capital expenditure. In

4


-----

recent years we have invested capital expenditure into growth projects intended to expand and enhance our
production capabilities and make our processes more efficient. For example, in January 2024, in order to bolster
our supply chain, increase reliability and improve our cost position for hydrocarbon resin production in Europe,
we purchased certain raw material production assets from Arakawa, which will be managed under contract at the
Dow ValuePark in Germany. In addition, through non-core divestments and rationalization, including the decision
to mothball our NBR facility in Kluang, Malaysia, which is expected to reduce our NBR production capacity by
approximately 20%, and support better utilization levels across the Group, we are focusing on reducing
complexity and optimizing our site footprint under our strategy to “Focus, Strengthen and Grow”.

**_Impressive track record of new product innovation through sustainability and customer focused R&D_**

We have an impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer-focused R&D
which supports our strong cash profile. We maintain four Centers of Excellence as part of an innovation network
comprising 12 sites. Our four Centers of Excellence include sites in Germany and the U.S., as well as our industryleading Asia Innovation Centre and our state-of-the-art U.K. Innovation Centre established in 2019. In 2024, we
broke ground on a new innovation center in Shanghai, China, designed to support our customers. The China
Innovation Center will focus on the development of products that meet new environmental requirements,
including high-performance adhesives for lithium batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, water-based
coatings and adhesives, and plastic modification and recycling. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we
invested £34 million in R&D and launched 14 new products. These investments in R&D continue to have a
significant effect on our revenues, with 22% of our sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2023 derived
from products that we developed in the previous five years or are protected by patent or other intellectual property
protections. We currently employ approximately 380 professionals in R&D-focused roles.

An increasing focus on sustainability is a key trend that, we believe, will increase customer demand as regulation
is driving the requirement for lower-carbon, bio-based and circular products. Our portfolio is positioned to help
drive circular solutions (for example, recyclable packaging) and our high-performance water-based polymers can
displace solvent-borne polymers, leading to further demand for the our products. As a recognized leader in waterbased and emission reducing polymers, this creates a huge opportunity for us. Our “Vision 2030” plan is a longterm, embedded part of our business strategy, which we expect to be a value driver and a key principle in our
responsible approach to doing business. Our “Vision 2030” plan includes targets for the areas where we can have
the most material impact, including:

  - at least 60% of new products having enhanced sustainability benefits by 2030 (64% as of December 31,
2023);

  - reducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 47% relative to 2019 baseline levels, which
have been adjusted to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (42% reduction
as of December 31, 2023);

  - reducing Scope 3 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 28% relative to 2019 baseline levels, which have
been adjusted to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (14% reduction as of
December 31, 2023); and

  - at least 40% women in senior management roles (30% as of December 31, 2023).

We have a long track record of helping customers towards their own sustainability goals. Our emission-reducing
solutions and lower-carbon intensity operations all make a positive contribution towards customers’ Scope 3
carbon footprints. Our capabilities and products can help customers in multiple areas, whether that is replacing
solvent-based coatings with water-based alternatives, developing water-based polymers and re-dispersible
powders for construction customers, or innovating bio-based, low-carbon footprint and circular solutions for
adhesives.

**_Clear direction to increase specialization, grow global position and streamline operations_**

We have developed a well-balanced and diversified portfolio through a combination of organic and inorganic
growth and a continued repositioning towards specialty and complex formulations, supported by our robust R&D
activity, which helps to make our revenue more resilient to negative fluctuations in the demand for any particular

5

product or from any specific customer or geography. As we grow and capitalize on the underlying macroeconomic
trends in the speciality chemical industry, we have a clear path to increasing our product mix towards speciality
chemicals as we balance the geographic distribution of our end markets and streamline operations. A diverse
portfolio lends itself toward an increasing focus on high-value specialty chemical products for attractive and
resilient niche markets characterized by growth in excess of GDP.

Over the past year, we have increased our proportion of speciality chemicals from roughly 50% of our production
in 2022 to approximately 55% in 2023, as we look to drive this percentage higher toward 70% speciality chemical
weighting in the future. Our focus on the key value drivers for the speciality chemical market, including high
customer intimacy, value-based pricing, application innovation and flexibility in production in logistics, provides
a clear path to achieve this weighting.

Further, we aim to balance our geographic revenue distribution between EMEA, the United States and Asia. We
derived approximately half of our revenues in 2023 from EMEA, with the remaining half split between the United
States and Asia. As we seek to optimize our geographic footprint, we intend to increase our presence in the United
States while maintaining our presence in Asia, such that approximately 40% of our revenues are from EMEA,
approximately 35% from the United States and the remaining quarter from Asia. The following figure illustrates
our evolving geographic footprint, speciality chemical weighting and number of sites:

We aim to accomplish this geographic rebalancing while we streamline our operations, such that we move from
more than 40 sites in 2022 to less than 30 sites in strategic locations in the future.

**_Experienced management team with impressive track record_**

Our senior management team has strong industry experience with a demonstrated track record of achieving
profitable growth in the speciality chemical industry, successfully managing business portfolios through
acquisitions and divestments, disciplined capital investment plans and optimizing our fixed cost base. Michael
Willome, our chief executive officer, has led us since November 2021 after previously having served as chief
executive officer of another public global industrial company. Following the key acquisitions of OMNOVA in
2020 and the Adhesive Resins Business in 2022, our management team has effectively integrated these
acquisitions and we have been able to achieve synergies above initial projections in both acquired businesses.
Our management team has extensive experience in the speciality chemical industry, including working for leading
companies such as Conzzeta AG, Essentra plc, Chemtura, GE Speciality Chemicals and Clariant, and a proven
ability to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and working capital. We believe the
experience of our management team is a distinct competitive advantage. In addition, our senior management team
has demonstrated the ability to streamline our businesses by focusing on core competencies and divest of noncore businesses, as evidenced by the divestment of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses in
February 2023. The divestment of non-core businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core
activities, reduce our capital expenditure requirements going forward and also reduce our exposure to
underperforming cash consuming businesses.

**_Well-established financial policy with clear plan underway to further deleverage._**

We aim to maintain a conservative and sustainable capital management strategy with clear policies with respect
to our balance sheet leverage, and investments and shareholder returns in order to maintain an efficient and flexible
capital structure over a longer term. We take a disciplined approach to investment opportunities including mergers
and acquisitions and growth capital expenditure.

While our ambition historically has been to maintain a net leverage to EBITDA ratio, on an ongoing basis, of
approximately 1.0–2.0x, which we view as sustainable, our leverage is currently at higher than average levels,
due primarily to historically low NBR prices and demand as a result of destocking following the COVID-19
pandemic, combined with increased debt taken on to finance the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business.

We have responded to this challenge and in October 2023, completed a £276 million rights issue (net proceeds of
£266 million), demonstrating our commitment to reducing our leverage alongside other targeted actions,
including:

  - _Dividend suspension: In October 2022, we announced the suspension of all dividends for the year ended_
December 31, 2023 and an ongoing suspension until our net leverage is at least below 3.0x.

  - _Non-core divestment: The divestment of our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Business on February_
28, 2023 raised net cash proceeds of $262 million (with a further $5 million receivable in cash on the
13-month anniversary of completion), while supporting our ongoing drive to increase the speciality
weighting of the Group. Our non-core portfolio rationalization program remains ongoing, with three
further formal divestment processes currently underway.

  - _Cost savings: We reduced our capital expenditures in 2023 to £84 million (£91 million in 2022) and have_
deployed a discretionary cost-savings program that successfully saved the Group £18 million in 2023,
further targeting savings of £30-40 million annually from our new procurement program and
approximately £20 million from our Adhesive Solutions program over 2024 and 2025.

  - _Working capital improvements: We identified opportunities to optimize working capital, in particular for_
our Adhesives Solutions business, with an overall reduction in inventory of £46 million in 2023. In
addition, we instituted a receivables financing program, with a £27.9 million increase in receivables
financing to £110.6 million.

**Our Strategy**

Our growth strategy is driven by global megatrends and we are focused on driving sustainable growth through
business efficiency, R&D and capital investment projects. Our strategy is composed of the following key pillars:

**_Organic growth in attractive end markets_**

Our core strategic growth markets, comprising coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection, each
benefit from robust sectoral growth dynamics in excess of baseline GDP. These markets are driven by accelerating
global megatrends including accelerating urbanization, demographic and social change, climate change and
sustainability and shifting economic power. In October 2022, as part of its new strategy, we announced a new
divisional organizational structure aligning our organization with our core end-markets. This alignment of
operational segments and end-markets is expected to assist us in anticipating and meeting customers’ needs at
pace and deliver better products with improved margin and product differentiation.

Innovation and more sustainable products, such as water-based solutions displacing solvents in the construction,
coatings and adhesives markets, are key drivers of growth across the Group’s core markets and developing
products through focused customer-centric R&D is a key component of the Group’s strategy. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, 22% of our sales volumes were derived from products that we launched in the previous five
years or are protected by patent or other intellectual property protections. In the year ended December 31, 2023,
we launched 14 new products across multiple application areas.

**_Rigorous and consistent portfolio management to build focused, leading positions_**

As part of focusing the business, we intend to increase the weighting of speciality chemicals versus base chemicals
in our portfolio, create a more balanced geographic footprint, streamline our operations and apply more efficient
capital allocation across our businesses. During our strategic review in 2022, we identified our core markets,
which combine the most attractive growth prospects and where we are most differentiated. We are focusing our
resources on these segments and our new divisional structure enables differentiated steering in the allocation of
financial and operational resources in line with this strategy.

In addition, we identified a number of non-core businesses which have limited synergies with the rest our
identified growth platforms and which are less attractive areas for us to deploy capital. In line with our strategy,
on February 28, 2023, we completed the divestment of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses.
Moving forward, we will continue to assess our strategic position in terms of disposing of non-core businesses to
rationalize our portfolio, reduce complexity and increase our focus on attractive end-markets and speciality
products.

Our divisional structure enables a differentiated steering of the allocation of financial and operational resources,
including capital allocation. We aim to allocate approximately 75% of our capital to the Coatings & Construction
Solutions and Adhesive Solutions divisions and approximately 25% to the Health & Protection and Performance
Materials division over the medium-term.

While our primary focus is on furthering our non-core divestment program, alongside this we are actively
considering a number of low-capital growth opportunities, such as potential partnerships. We are also identifying
potential accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities in strategically attractive end markets and geographies for the
future, when our financial circumstances allow.

**_Operational and commercial excellence in how we run our business_**

We are focused on continuous improvement across our operations to advance production efficiency, sales
effectiveness and functional excellence while remaining committed to our sustainability standards. To achieve
these aims, we seek to identify good practice in all areas of the business and ensure that relevant learnings are
disseminated across the business.

We aim to drive profitability through maximizing the utilization of our assets. To achieve this, we focus on
identifying the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. For example, a project at
our Longview site in Texas will debottleneck production and is expected to increase capacity by 10% to take
advantage of growth in the amorphous polyolefin market in North America.

For decades, we have been a world leading supplier of water-based polymers that avoid the use of solvents and
keep harmful VOCs out of the atmosphere. We have also become a global innovator in driving the use of waterbased technology. Over the last few years, we have worked to embed environmental sustainability into our
products and operations while remaining committed to driving efficiency. Sustainability now plays a major role
in our innovation agenda for customers, as well as our ongoing work to address our own greenhouse gas emission
footprint, as measured by our _“Vision 2030” roadmap and near-term milestone targets, as overseen by the_
Executive Sustainability Steering Committee established in 2022.

**_Diversity, equity and inclusion and holistic people development_**

Across all of our businesses, our employees execute our strategy and deliver for all stakeholders and we continue
to develop them to be prepared for the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. To support this, we are
implementing four strategic employee priorities: (i) promoting holistic people development; (ii) strengthening our
leadership capability; (iii) embracing Synthomer excellence; and (iv) establishing an innovative workplace
culture.

**Recent Developments**

**_The Tender Offer_**

On April 9, 2024, we announced a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase at par for cash consideration up
to €370.0 million of our Existing Notes, held in the relevant Regulation S global note by non-U.S. holders outside
the United States, validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer (the “Maximum
**Acceptance Amount”). The Tender Offer is expected to expire at 4:00 p.m., London time, on April 16, 2024 and**
settlement is expected to take place on April 19, 2024, conditional on, among other things, the closing of the
Offering. The Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to (i) waive any and all conditions to the Tender
Offer, (ii) extend or terminate the Tender Offer, (iii) increase the Maximum Acceptance Amount or (iv) otherwise
amend the Tender Offer in any respect, in each case, without offering revocation rights to holders of the Existing
Notes. In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted for purchase
pursuant to the Tender Offer is less than the Maximum Acceptance Amount, the Issuer intends to redeem a portion
of the Existing Notes equal to the difference between such tendered amount and the Maximum Acceptance
Amount. The Issuer intends to effect such redemption at par following July 1, 2024.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase the Existing Notes. The Tender Offer will be
made pursuant to a separate tender offer memorandum (the “Offer to Purchase”) and not pursuant to this Offering
Memorandum. It is expected that the offering of Notes will price before the Tender Offer expires. Accordingly,
the results of the Tender Offer will not be known at the time of pricing of the Notes, and neither the pricing nor
the closing of the offering of the Notes is conditioned upon the consummation of the Tender Offer at any minimum
level of acceptance. The Offer to Purchase, and not this Offering Memorandum, sets out the terms of the Tender
Offer and the procedures for noteholders to tender any Existing Notes. Neither the Offer to Purchase nor any part
thereof is incorporated by reference in, or forms part of, this Offering Memorandum.

**_Recent Trading_**

_The following information relating to our recent performance is derived from the Group’s internal accounts for_
_the two month period ended February 29, 2024. This information is based solely on preliminary internal_
_information used by management and management estimates and remains subject to our normal half-year and_
_full-year processes. None of the foregoing information has been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any_
_procedures by the Company’s auditors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. As a result, this information_
_may change. In particular, during the course of our review process, we could identify items that would require us_
_to make adjustments, which might be material. Certain statements in this section are forward-looking. They are_
_based upon our expectations and assumptions regarding our strategies, cost savings and divisional improvement_
_programs, the macroeconomic environment and the sectors and industry in which we operate, in particular_
_around end-market uses and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors impacting demand for our products,_
_which may prove not to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the following discussion_
_as a prediction of actual results or otherwise. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent_
_accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the forecast presented below,_
_nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and_
_assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the forecast. We undertake no obligation to_
_publicly update or revise the discussion below or any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new_
_information, future events or otherwise. Actual results and market developments may differ materially from those_
_described below. See “Forward-looking statements” and “Risk factors” herein for a description of factors that_
_may cause these statements not to materialize._

Trading since the start of 2024 has been cautiously encouraging, supported in part by short-term restocking by
our customers. We do not yet have evidence of a broad-based upswing in underlying end-market demand, but
parts of our business are beginning to build an improving volume trend.

In 2024, the Group will continue to focus on delivering our speciality solutions strategy, including portfolio
management, alongside our ongoing activities to generate robust cash flow and successfully navigate through
current uncertainties in our markets. Reducing leverage further towards our 1-2x medium-term target range
remains a key priority.

-----

In addition to further progress with our previously announced actions to reduce cost and complexity and to
improve site reliability, we have commenced procurement and production cost optimization programs which are
expected to deliver £30 million to £40 million in additional savings in 2024 and 2025. These actions will be
partially offset by some increases in operating costs, mainly due to wage inflation and normalization of bonus
accrual. As a result, we expect to make some earnings progress and be at least modestly Free Cash Flow positive
in 2024, even if macroeconomic demand conditions do not improve.

**Sources and Uses**

On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i)
repurchase or redeem certain of the Existing Notes and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the
Offering.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds relating to the Offering. Actual amounts
are subject to adjustment and may differ significantly from estimated amounts, depending on several factors,
including the amount of accrued interest, fluctuations in the exchange rates among the euro and the pound sterling
and the amount of Existing Notes repurchased.

**(£ in**

**Sources** **millions)** **Uses** **(£ in millions)**

Notes offered hereby[(1)] ............................. 303.5 Repurchase of Existing Notes[(3)] ............ 320.8
Cash on balance sheet[(2)] ............................ 23.3 Estimated fees and expenses[(4)] .............. 6.0

**Total Sources ..........................................** **326.8** **Total Uses.............................................** **326.8**

(1) We have assumed that the Notes will be issued at par. Represents the pound sterling equivalent aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated Notes offered hereby, converted into pound sterling using the pound per euro exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00
= £0.8671. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576 were to be used, the principal amount of the Notes
would be approximately £300.1 million.

(2) Represents cash on balance sheet expected to be used in connection with the repurchase or redemption of the Existing Notes.

(3) Represents the estimated cash consideration to be used in connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes at par assuming that
principal amount equal to the Maximum Tender Amount of €370.0 million is tendered and accepted for purchase, excluding any accrued
interest. In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted for purchase is less than the Maximum
Acceptance Amount, the Issuer intends to redeem a portion of the Existing Notes equal to the difference between such tendered amount
and the Maximum Acceptance Amount. The Issuer intends to effect such redemption at par following July 1, 2024. The principal amount
of Existing Notes to be repurchased has been converted into pound sterling using the pound per euro exchange rate on December 31,
2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576 were to be used, the amount would be
approximately £317.3 million.

(4) Represents our estimate of the fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with or otherwise related to the Offering and the Tender
Offer, including financing fees, professional and legal fees, financial advisory fees and other transaction costs but excluding accrued but
unpaid interest in respect of the Existing Notes repurchased in connection with the Tender Offer or redemption,. Actual fees and related
expenses may differ from these estimates. This amount does not give effect to any capitalization of debt issuance costs.

the Guarantors generated 65.2% of our EBITDA.

(9) Synthomer Jefferson Hills LLC and Synthomer Adhesive Technologies LLC were originally Eastman operating companies. Following
completion of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business on April 1, 2022, Synthomer Jefferson Hills LLC and Synthomer
Adhesive Technologies LLC became wholly owned subsidiaries of Synthomer Inc. (at such time, known as OMNOVA Solutions Inc.)
and both entities are Guarantors under the Notes.

(10) Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of December 31, 2023, the total borrowings of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries,

on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Offering, including the application of the net proceeds therefrom, and the use of proceeds
therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” were nil. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the nonGuarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, the nonguarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets
to the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Guarantees—The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally
_subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

(11) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer is party to certain joint ventures and holds a minority stake in certain entities.

These entities are not in the Restricted Group and are thus not subject to the covenants contained in the Indenture. See “Description of
_the Notes.”_

**Guarantees .................................**


The Notes:

existing and future obligations that are not expressly
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,

13


-----

including debt under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility and the UKEF Facilities;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and any future
obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes;

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
secured obligations of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of
such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless such
property or assets also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable
or senior basis;

   - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
obligations of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not provide
Guarantees; and

   - will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors.

The Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) by the Guarantors on
the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—The Guarantees.”

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the
Guarantees:

   - will be a senior obligation of the Guarantor that granted such
Guarantee;

   - will rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such_
Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are not expressly
contractually subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantee, including debt under the Existing Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities;

   - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and any future
obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee; and

   - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
secured obligations of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value
of such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless
such property or assets also secure such Guarantee on an equal
and ratable or senior basis.

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the
Guarantors also guarantee the obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, in each case, on a
senior basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Guarantors generated 65.2%
of our EBITDA.

As of December 31, 2023, our direct and indirect subsidiaries that do not
Guarantee the Notes had no outstanding borrowings (excluding
intercompany borrowings).

The obligations of the Guarantors will be limited under the Indenture to
reflect limitations under applicable law, if any, including, but not limited
to, with respect to maintenance of share capital, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency and other legal
restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their directors. For more
information on potential limitations to the Guarantees, see “Certain

14


-----

_Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.” By virtue of these_
limitations, certain Guarantors’ obligation under their Guarantees will
be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or
the Guarantors may have effectively no obligation under their
Guarantees.

The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances.
See “Description of the Notes—Release of the Guarantees.”

**Use of Proceeds .............................** On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together
with cash on balance sheet, to (i) repurchase or redeem certain of the
Existing Notes and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the
Offering. Any gross proceeds not used for the Tender Offer (including
by reason of the Existing Notes being accepted for repurchase in an
amount less than the Maximum Tender Amount) will be used for the
repayment of other debt. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption ...................** At any time prior to, 2026, we may redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the net cash proceeds of
certain equity offerings, at the redemption price of      % of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after the redemption.
See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time prior to, 2026, we may redeem some or all of
the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
redemption date plus the applicable “make whole” premium. See
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time on or after, 2026, we may redeem some or all
of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or
any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases
all of the Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem
the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder
of such Notes.

**Optional Tax Redemption ...........** If, as a result of certain changes or amendments in the tax laws of any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in the Description of the Notes)
the Issuer or any Guarantor is or would on the next payment date be
required to pay any Additional Amounts (as defined in the Description
of the Notes), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part,
at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption Upon
_Changes in Withholding Taxes.”_

**Additional Amounts .....................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect
to the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes, unless required by law. If withholding or deduction
for such taxes imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as

15


-----

defined in the Description of the Notes) is required to be made with
respect to a payment on the Notes or the Guarantees, subject to certain
exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will
pay such Additional Amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount
received after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount
that would have been received in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.”

**Change of Control ........................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control”
(as defined for purposes of the Notes), holders of the Notes will have the
right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or part of the Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants ........................** The Indenture governing the Notes will contain covenants that will,
among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined therein) to, among other things:

                            - incur additional debt;

                            - create liens;

                            - pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other
restricted payments or investments;

                            - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted
subsidiaries;

                            - sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;

                            - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

                            - effect a consolidation or merger.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and
exceptions and certain of them will be suspended if and when, and for
so long as, the Notes are rated investment grade. For more details see
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions ....................** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction
and may not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. We have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to,
register the Notes (including by way of an exchange offer).

**No Established Market .................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market
for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing ............................................** Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the Notes
to be listed and admitted to trading on the ISM. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the London Stock Exchange,
that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

_December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. The financial data in the consolidated income statement and consolidated_
_cash flow statement for the year ended December 31, 2021 labeled as “represented” herein, are derived from the_

_Consolidated Financial Statements, which gives effect to the classification of the Laminates, Films and Coated_
_Fabrics Businesses as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Such comparative financial_
_information has been presented in accordance with IFRS 5 to report the discontinued operations separately from_
_continuing operations. The financial data in the consolidated income statement and consolidated cash flow_
_statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 labeled as “represented” is derived from the unaudited_
_comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in the 2023 Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, which gives effect to the classification of the North America Paper and Carpet Business as_
_discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. Such comparative financial information has been_
_presented in accordance with IFRS 5 to report the discontinued operations separately from continuing operations._
_See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”_

_to service our indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in_
_evaluating us. You should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS_
_measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not_

(5) We define EBITDA as operating profit before depreciation, amortization and Special Items. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Data” for the definition of Special Items and footnote (A) below for a breakdown of Special Items for the relevant periods. We believe_
that EBITDA provides useful information to investors about our results of operations because it is among the measures used by our
Board and management to evaluate our Underlying operating performance, review business trends, identify strategies to improve results
and make day-to-day operating decisions, and it allows a comparison of our results across periods on a consistent basis by removing the
effects on our operating performance of our capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset base and capital
investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortization) and items largely outside the control of management (such as income taxes).
In addition, you should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation in the future and that certain
of these items could be considered recurring in nature. Our presentation of EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our
future results will be unaffected by unusual or irregular items. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
measures of our operating performance in accordance with IFRS. The Underlying performance measures, including EBITDA, provide
additional information in line with how financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board. We believe that
these non-IFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ongoing performance and our ability to service our indebtedness and can assist
certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in evaluating us. You should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS
measures as reported by us to non-IFRS measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and
you should not consider them in isolation. For example, with respect to EBITDA, some of these limitations include the following: (i) it
does not reflect our capital expenditures, our future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) it does not
reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) it does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash
requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any
cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, EBITDA adjusted to exclude
the impact of IFRS 16 would have been £129.5 million.

The following table reconciles EBITDA from operating profit-IFRS for the periods indicated.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or_
_in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of_
_such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom._
_Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the risks_
_described below and other information in this Offering Memorandum and their personal circumstances. The_
_occurrence of any of the following events could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business,_
_prospects, results of operations and financial condition and impair our ability to fulfil our obligations in respect_
_of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes._

_The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used_
_as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently deem_
_immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,_
_results of operations or financial condition._

_This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on assumptions and estimates,_
_and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the_
_forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS**

**_We may not be able to implement our business strategy or fully capitalize upon our investments in progress._**

Our future financial performance and success largely depend on our ability to implement our business strategy
successfully. In October 2022, we announced an update to our strategy, setting out our plans to “Focus, Strengthen
_and Grow” the business along three new divisions: Coatings & Construction Solutions; Adhesive Solutions; and_
Health & Protection and Performance Materials. The strategy includes targets associated with increasing the
weighting of speciality chemicals versus base chemicals in our portfolio, creating a more balanced geographic
exposure, streamlining our operational footprint and applying more rigorous capital allocation across our
businesses. We also announced an intent to rationalize our portfolio through the divestment of non-core
businesses, which commenced with the divestment of our non-core Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics
Businesses, which we completed in February 2023.

Our business strategy is based on assumptions about future demand for products and the new products and
applications we are developing and on our continuing ability to produce products profitably. Each of these factors
depends on, among other things, our ability to innovate to keep up with sustainable practices (for example, one of
our critical enablers of our business strategy is advancing more sustainable practices in line with our “Vision
_2030” plan), changes in technology, the competitive environment, operate in accordance with regulations imposed_
by local jurisdictions to deal with extreme circumstances, allocate talent and capital to growth driving businesses,
identify non-core businesses for disposal, acquire suitable targets at appropriate times, integrate acquired
businesses, finance operations and product development activities, maintain and expand high quality, more
sustainable and efficient manufacturing operations, efficiently manage our supply chains (including as a result of
geopolitical events), expand into new markets, respond to competitive and regulatory changes, comply with
competition regulations in various jurisdictions, access quality raw materials in a cost effective and timely manner,
and retain and attract highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel.

In addition, we may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, the objectives and benefits of our cash
saving program or other cost reduction initiatives. The cash saving program, announced in October 2022 as part
of our broader plan to “Focus, Strengthen and Grow” includes various initiatives to reduce our leverage towards
the target of between 1-2x net debt to EBITDA, including the suspension of dividends and targeted reductions in
working capital and capital expenditure. However, there may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing one or
more of such initiatives, and we may not ultimately realize the full benefits of, or be able to sustain the benefits
anticipated by, these initiatives. In addition, through short-term reductions in capital expenditure, we may
experience future decreases in manufacturing capacity or new product launches, which may in turn materially
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and any such effect may not ultimately be
addressed in full or in part by existing contractual recourse or insurance coverage that we may benefit from.

24


-----

Difficulties with predicting GDP growth expectations in many countries means that many chemical producers,
including ourselves, may find it difficult to accurately model and predict the prospects for their businesses, and it
may be difficult for investors to use historical financial information as an indicator for future results. Any failure
by us to accurately predict the economic environment and the development of our business could lead to
misjudgments as to the level of production capacity needed for our business, increase the risk of failed investments
and may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We intend to balance our portfolio of businesses and this may involve carrying out disposals and acquisitions_**
**_which may prove difficult to consummate and the anticipated benefits may not materialize at all or to the extent_**
**_expected._**

As part of our “Focus, Strengthen and Grow” strategy announced in October 2022, we announced an intent to
rationalize our portfolio through the divestment of non-core businesses, which commenced with the divestment
of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses, announced in December 2022. Our ability to divest assets
could be affected by various factors, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase such assets at
acceptable prices. We may also incur unexpected additional costs with recent and future disposals and our business
following any disposal may be less diversified. Moreover, as a result of any recent or future disposals, including
the divestment of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses, we have and may become less diversified,
which may make it more susceptible to adverse developments in our remaining product and business lines.

In addition, sellers can be required to retain certain liabilities or agree to indemnify buyers for certain matters and
to dispose of certain assets we may provide an indemnity to a buyer. The magnitude of any such retained liability
or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be
material. Moreover, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided
prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations
guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.

Our strategy also involves acquisitions from time to time, including the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins
Business from Eastman in April 2022 and the key acquisitions of: (i) OMNOVA in April 2020; (ii) BASF
Pischelsdorf in January 2018; (iii) Speciality Additives in March 2017; and (iv) PAC in June 2016. While focus
in the short to medium-term will be on strengthening the balance sheet and reducing leverage, we may continue
to acquire companies or assets in the future if we identify suitable acquisition targets, however any acquisition
that we make could be subject to a number of risks, including problems with the effective integration of operations,
an inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships, increased operating costs, costs related to
achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations, the loss of key employees of the acquired
company, exposure to unanticipated liabilities and difficulties in realizing expected projected efficiencies,
synergies and cost savings.

As a result, it is possible that we identify targets that are not as appropriate for our business as expected or that
more is paid to acquire the target than the value that we expected to realize from the acquisition.

In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, despite the due diligence we perform, we may encounter
performance, funding or cash flow issues with the acquired business when compared to our expectations, or we
may have inadvertently or unknowingly acquired actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims,
claims for breach of contract, employment related claims, environmental liabilities, hazardous materials or
liability for hazardous materials or tax liabilities. If any of the above were to materialize, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which would increase our debt service requirements,
or we may use operating cash flows to finance acquisitions, which would decrease the amount of cash on balance
sheet. See “—Risks Relating to Our Financial Position—We may operate with a level of leverage that could
_affect our ability to implement our strategy and, as a result, adversely affect our business, financial condition,_
_results of operations and prospect.” In order to manage any acquisitions we successfully complete, we will need_
to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems.

If balancing our portfolio by making disposals or acquisitions or integrating any acquired business diverts too
much management attention from the operations of our current businesses, this could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Any acquisition or disposal we consummate may not ultimately provide the

25


-----

benefits originally anticipated. See “—Potential future impairments of intangible assets could have a material
_adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.” Furthermore, we may not succeed_
in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or financing, if necessary, on favorable terms.

**_The occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at our facilities could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our level of asset utilization, as well as our overall business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

As of December 31, 2023, we operated 36 active production sites (with another announced closure underway) in
17 countries globally. The results of our business are dependent on the continued operation of these production
facilities and the maintenance of high levels of asset utilization, the transport infrastructure that carries supplies
to the facilities and the ability to complete planned construction, capacity expansion and maintenance projects on
schedule.

The chemical manufacturing industry is inherently dangerous. Our operations are subject to these dangers and the
related use, storage, transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and wastes, including: severe weather
conditions such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods, extreme temperature fluctuations or any other natural or
manmade disaster or other adverse weather conditions; explosions and other accidents, including pipeline leaks
and ruptures; human error or mechanical failures; unplanned production downtime; transportation interruptions;
negligent actions of third parties; terrorism or sabotage aimed at disrupting our production facilities; unpermitted
discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; and other environmental health, safety and
security risks.

These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and
equipment, delays in the transportation of products, as well as environmental damage and may result in suspension
of operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and damage awards. See “—
_We may incur litigation related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to product quality._
The acquisition of certain adhesive resins sites as part of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business has
increased the likelihood of some of these risks, due to the high temperatures and pressures these units operate at
and core technology that is outside of our previous expertise.

Additionally, many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content.
Transportation and storage of these products can be costly, given the size and weight of water-based products as
well as the hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals.

We also have scheduled shutdowns at our production facilities in order to perform necessary inspections and
testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out maintenance that may be necessary.
Scheduled shutdowns may require longer downtime than anticipated. Unscheduled shutdowns may occur due to
technical failure or other reasons. Extended downtime at any of our major operating facilities, whether the result
of a scheduled shutdown or otherwise, could reduce rates of asset utilization and undermine our ability to maintain
high production volumes and meet our commitment to customers, which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any significant interruption occurring from time to time in operations at our facilities, including interruptions
caused by the events described above, may exceed the limitations of our current insurance coverage. See “—
_Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in our_
_insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of_
_operations.” Changes in our insurance costs could also reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular_
production plant, or our business generally, during and after such interruptions.

**_We may be subject to information technology systems failures, network disruptions and breaches of cyber_**
**_security. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption_**
**_and/or financial loss._**

The industries in which we operate have become increasingly dependent on information technology to conduct
certain processing activities. For example, we depend on information technology to perform many of our services
and to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate
attacks, have increased and may further increase as a result of ongoing Russian military action in Ukraine, conflict

26


-----

in the Middle East, or otherwise. The technologies, systems and networks utilized by us and our vendors, suppliers
and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could
result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other
information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance,
may remain undetected for an extended period.

Increased reliance on technology carries with it an increased risk of cybersecurity issues, including phishing and
end point vulnerability, which has been particularly heightened in light of the current environment of increased
remote working following the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our systems for protecting against
cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to
expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and
remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Further, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2016/679) (“GDPR”) came into effect in Europe on May 25, 2018 and has created a range of new compliance
obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for non-compliance. GDPR was incorporated into
domestic law in the United Kingdom, with minor amendments, by virtue of EUWA, which we are also subject to.
While we continue to enhance our security defenses through increased investments and the implementation of our
cyber security plan, if a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were
to occur, whether as a result of a failure of our information technology security systems, data center outages,
employee negligence or the actions of vendors, we may lose intellectual property, suffer reputational damage
and/or be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other enforcement action. See “—We may not be able to
_adequately protect or effectively enforce our intellectual property rights.” All of the above may result in_
information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.

Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading systems, network disruptions,
data center outages and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our operational
efficiencies, delaying processing of transactions and inhibiting our ability to protect customer or internal
information. Our computer systems, including our backup systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power
outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches,
events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, and/or errors by our employees. Although we
have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security, backup systems and
internal control measures, a system failure or data security breach could occur and materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our use of several different currencies exposes us to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations that could_**
**_adversely affect our profitability and ability to repay indebtedness or comply with certain maintenance_**
**_covenants, which could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Our business is subject to risks normally associated with international operations, including currency and interest
rate fluctuation risks and local business risks. Our reporting and functional currency is the pound sterling while
we generate sales, incur costs and have assets and liabilities in other currencies, particularly the euro, Malaysian
ringgit and US dollar. Raw materials costs are primarily incurred in euro and US dollars, while the majority of
our sales are in euro, US dollars, and Malaysian ringgit. Our international subsidiaries typically report in local
currencies rather than in pounds sterling. Profit translation exposures from overseas operations are not hedged.
As a result, strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro, US dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result in a
decrease in our net sales reported in pounds sterling, which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating or financial results. In addition, our local subsidiaries may incur costs in, and
generate income in, currencies other than their respective reporting currencies, exposing them to foreign currency
transaction risk.

Furthermore, a significant proportion of our assets and liabilities are also in currencies other than pound sterling,
principally euro, Malaysian ringgit and US dollars and assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at
the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date for inclusion in our financial statements. Moreover, a
significant proportion of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. As
a result, to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the currency in which capital expenditure is
to be incurred and we do not have sufficient cash flows in the respective currency to make such capital expenditure,
the effective cost of making such capital expenditure may be higher.

27


-----

We evaluate exchange rate risks from time to time and use borrowings in local currencies to hedge overseas net
assets. We do not hedge our profit translation exposure. Our foreign currency hedging strategies may not
adequately protect our results of operations or balance sheet position from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations,
which may result in losses or may limit any benefit that may otherwise be received from favorable movements in
exchange rates. Any significant adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

In addition, we have an exposure to interest rate risks, arising principally on changes in US dollar and Euro interest
rates. We manage this risk by managing the proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings and utilizing interest
rate swaps but this may not adequately protect our results of operations or balance sheet position from the effect
of interest rate fluctuations, which may result in losses or may limit any benefit that may otherwise be received
from favorable movements in interest rates. Any significant adverse fluctuations in interest rates could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

**_Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs may_**
**_adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost._**

We have funding risks relating to our UK and overseas defined benefit pension schemes. Our principal funded
defined benefit pension schemes are in the United Kingdom and the United States and both are closed to new
entrants and future accrual. We also operate an unfunded defined benefit scheme in Germany and various other
defined contribution overseas retirement benefit arrangements. Our pension plans are subject to legislative and
regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions. Our pension costs and liabilities are materially affected by the
discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at
the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the market value of the assets
declines or the value of the liabilities increases, we may be required to increase our contributions to our UK and
overseas defined benefit schemes.

A variety of factors, including factors outside our control, may adversely affect the value of the assets or liabilities,
including interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, longevity risk, actuarial data, adjustments, regulatory
changes and the strength of the employer covenant provided to our pension schemes. If these or other internal and
external factors were to become unfavorable, or more unfavorable than they currently are, the costs and net
liabilities associated with the UK and overseas defined benefit schemes could increase substantially. Significant
changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding
increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected
rate of return on plan assets. Any change in key actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, would impact
the valuation of pension obligations, which affects the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the
net periodic pension cost in the following financial years. Any declines in the fair values of the pension plans’
assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels. Any decrease in
interest rates will result in an increase of pension liabilities.

We cannot predict whether changing conditions will require us to make future additional contributions to the
pension schemes, or whether we will have the funds necessary to make minimum pension contributions at the
times that they may be required. As a result, we may incur higher than expected costs or other liabilities associated
with funding the pension plans. In addition, the UK Pensions Regulator has extensive powers relating to UK
pensions schemes, including the statutory power in certain circumstances to issue contribution notices or financial
support directions that, if issued, could result in significant additional liabilities arising for us.

The asset portfolios of our UK and US defined benefit pension schemes contain a proportion of equity assets. The
holding of equity assets has been reduced with a view to reducing the level of exposure to volatility in equity
markets. Although, all other things being equal, this should help to reduce fluctuations in the assets of the pension
schemes, the other factors noted above could still lead to significant fluctuations in the size of the deficits in each
scheme. As of December 31, 2023, the deficit in relation to our defined benefit pension schemes stood at £64.7
million, calculated in accordance with IAS 19 while deficit recovery contributions amounted to £5.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023. Our contribution requirements to the defined benefit schemes are regularly
assessed. In respect of the UK defined benefit scheme, contribution requirements are generally assessed every
three years as part of a full actuarial valuation, the next of which will take place in 2024.

**_Health and safety concerns associated with chemical use could result in significant losses or liabilities._**

There is a risk that one or more of the key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have a
currently unrecognized toxicological or health related impact on the environment or on our customers or
employees. Such hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the
environment, which could lead to government fines or work stoppage injunctions and lawsuits by injured persons.
If such actions are determined to be adverse, insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims. Such outcomes
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

In addition, health and safety concerns could increase the costs incurred by customers to use products and
otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to decreased demand. Materials such as acrylonitrile,
ethylbenzene, styrene, butadiene, Bisphenol A and halogenated flame retardant which currently are or may in the
future be used in the manufacturing of products, have come under scrutiny due to potentially significant or
perceived health and safety concerns. Such a decrease in demand would likely have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

More generally in the chemicals industry, products are subject to public scrutiny and may become the target of
environmental group protests and campaigns, which, in turn, could lead the public to develop a negative perception
of certain of our products, which could materially affect sales and volumes of such products.

**_We may incur litigation related expenses and/or reputational damage, including in relation to product quality._**

Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials and we have been from time to time, and in the future may
be, subject to claims made in relation to our property and operations or for personal injury. While we do not
currently have any material exposure in terms of safety, health and environment (“SHE”) litigation (other than
with respect to the Consent Decree), from time-to-time contractors or employees have been harmed during the
course of their employment. Injuries to contractors and employees may occur in the future.

From time to time, we have been subject to various claims, proceedings and lawsuits related to products, services,
contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property and other matters arising out of our business
operations or the business operations of our predecessors. Whether founded or unfounded, if any such claims,
proceedings, or lawsuits are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability, negatively
impact our business operations, and harm our reputation. The costs of investigating and defending against claims
can be substantial and our insurance may not be adequate.

In addition, we may be subject to litigation and the cost or the ultimate outcome of such litigation or other
proceedings, including remedies or damage awards, cannot be predicted. Adverse results in any litigation or other
proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may include but are not limited
to: actions relating to intellectual property; commercial arrangements; environmental; health and safety; joint
venture agreements; and labor and employment or other harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities
outside of our control.

Furthermore, our products have widespread uses in a variety of end-markets, including transportation, consumer
products, building and construction, industrial and health and protection. Product quality and reliability are key
elements of our competitive position, and we may lose customers and potentially be liable for damages for any
quality issues. We have in the past, and may in the future, be named as defendants in product liability claims.
Were any such product liability claim or series of claims arising out of these various uses (particularly where the
value of such claims are in excess of our insurance coverage, applicable indemnification agreements, or any
provision made), to be successful against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We could be required to increase our debt or divert resources from other
investments in our business in order to discharge any such claims or might not be able to cover such claims at all.

**_We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our employees or contractors or our_**
**_customers (including product liability claims) or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to_**
**_meet certain quality specifications._**

Many of our products provide critical performance attributes to customers’ products that are sold to endconsumers. The sale of these products involve the risk of product liability claims. If a person were to bring a

29


-----

product liability claim in respect of a product which contains any products produced by us, that party may also be
named as a defendant in that claim, and we may be subject to separate litigation brought by our customer. Further,
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications, a customer could seek replacement
of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as designed and marketed.
A successful claim or series of claims against us could cause reputational harm and have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results and result in the loss of one or more
customers.

In addition, we may be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by employees or contractors who
have been harmed during the course of their work. Adverse results in any such litigation or other proceedings may
materially harm our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

**_Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes in_**
**_our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of_**
**_operations._**

Our plant, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage and business interruption risks, and our
business as a whole is insured for product liability risks. In addition, we carry marine cargo and director and
officer liability insurance. However, such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our
businesses and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered.

We may incur losses beyond these maximum limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. If this
occurs, and there is any liability, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. See “—The occurrence of major operational interruptions or problems at our facilities could
_have a material adverse effect on our level of asset utilization, as well as our overall business, financial condition_
_and results of operations.”_

In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industry have not been available
on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be
able to obtain coverage at current levels and/or the premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies may
increase significantly on the coverage that is currently maintained. If insurance is not available at commercially
acceptable premiums, there is a risk that our insurance coverage does not cover the full scope and extent of claims
against us or losses that we incur, including, but not limited to, claims for environmental or industrial accidents,
occupational illnesses, pollution and product liability and business interruption.

Furthermore, we could be required to increase our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business
to discharge an uninsured claim. Costs associated with unanticipated events in excess of our insurance coverage,
or a failure to maintain such coverage could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations._**

Our success in the highly competitive markets in which we operate will continue to depend to a significant extent
on certain key, highly skilled employees, including our executive directors, heads of divisions, regional managers,
market development and R&D directors, key technical specialists and project managers. In addition, our future
growth and success also depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial, sales,
administration, operating and technical personnel. The acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business from
Eastman has also provided us with the ability to further expand our management and research capabilities. We
may not be able to retain key employees or to recruit qualified individuals. The loss of key employees could result
in high transition costs and could disrupt our operations, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to collective bargaining or works council agreements with certain of our employees, and the_**
**_failure to renew or renegotiate such agreements on acceptable terms or any labor disturbances could result in_**
**_work stoppages or increased costs._**

Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in relations with our employees. As of
December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 4,200 employees globally, across 36 production sites (with
another announced closure underway) in more than 20 countries. Approximately 55% of our non-management
employees are covered by some form of collective bargaining arrangement at site or national level or a works
council agreement. In addition, a significant portion of our employees reside in countries in which employment
laws provide employees with significant bargaining power or other rights that may require us to spend more time
and expenses when altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or making staff reductions. For
example, many of our employees in Europe are represented by unions or works councils, which are on the board
of directors of certain local subsidiaries by law and generally must approve changes in conditions of employment,
including salaries and benefits.

We may not be able to renew any such collective bargaining agreements or work council agreements on terms
similar to current terms or renegotiate such agreements on acceptable terms. Additionally, in foreign jurisdictions
where we operate, national unions and foreign governments may be unable to reach agreements, which could
result in work stoppages that are out of our control.

In addition, if a collective bargaining agreement or a works council agreement is negotiated at a higher than
anticipated cost, such costs may need to be absorbed by us or passed through to customers in the form of higher
prices, which may make us less competitive. Furthermore, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our
facilities as a result of any changes to employment terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a
material adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, financial conditions and
results of operations.

**_Potential future impairments of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Our results of operations may vary due to the impairment of goodwill and/or other intangible assets relating to the
acquisition of acquired trademarks and licenses and acquired customer-related intangible assets. We carry
significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of our corporate
acquisitions and investments. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of goodwill amounted to £465.7
million while acquired intangible assets amounted to £452.5 million and other intangible assets amounted to £71.1
million.

We conduct annual impairment tests on goodwill and annual assessments of the carrying values of intangible and
tangible assets when impairment indicators exist. As a result, declines in our profitability or the value of
comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units and result in an impairment in the value
of goodwill, brands or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

For example, on April 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business for a total
consideration of £779.1 million and initially recorded associated goodwill of £124.9 million. However, as the
macroeconomic situation worsened in the second half of 2022 and end-user demand declined, demand for our
Adhesive Technologies products declined. The Adhesive Technologies division also experienced a number of
reliability and supply chain issues (which we are in the process of addressing, particularly with respect to the
stabilization and optimization of supply chain processes and the broadening of feedstock options), as well as lower
than expected acquisition of capacity. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a £133.7
million non-cash impairment charge to write-off substantially all of the goodwill recorded in connection with the
acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business.

Further, a reduction in expected future cash generation in light of potential difficult market conditions in the UK,
US, Germany or the other markets where we operate, could lead us to recognize additional impairments to other
cash generating units. While impairment to our goodwill and intangible assets does not affect reported cash flows,
EBITDA or any other underlying performance measures, any material impairment could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, net equity or financial condition as reported under IFRS.

**_Necessary licenses, certificates, approvals and permits for operations may not be renewed._**

Our operations will be subject to various licenses, certificates, approvals and permits in different foreign
jurisdictions. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew our licenses, certificates, approvals and permits
upon their expiration. The eligibility criteria for such licenses, certificates, approvals and permits may change
from time to time and may become more stringent. In addition, new requirements for licenses, certificates,
approvals and permits may come into effect in the future. The introduction of any new and/or more stringent laws,
regulation, licenses, certificates, approvals and permits requirements relevant to our business operations may
significantly escalate compliance and maintenance costs, preclude continuing with existing operations or limit or
prohibit business expansion. Such outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_The third-party ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect our_**
**_risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency or_**
**_underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from_**
**_investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The impact of our ESG-related risks and practices, including with respect to various environmental, social and
governance matters in our business and in the local communities in which we operate, has been and will continue
to be independently assessed by non-accredited ratings organizations and various stakeholders in the ESG
community. These rating agencies and stakeholders may not view our ESG policies as sufficiently transparent or
consistent with their performance standards or goals. If this view were shared in the broader ESG community, our
reputation could be damaged which, in certain cases, could effectively limit our access to capital markets and
result in scrutiny regarding our commitment to ESG principles and standards. In addition, ESG ratings may vary
among the different ESG ratings organizations and are subject to differing methodologies, assumptions and
priorities used by such organizations to assess ESG performance and risks. Each ESG rating provider’s rating
should be evaluated independently of any other ESG rating provider’s rating. There is no guarantee that the
methodology used by any particular ESG rating provider will conform with the expectations or requirements of
any investor or any present or future applicable standards, recommendations, criteria, laws, regulations, guidelines
or listing rules. As a result, our ESG ratings are not necessarily indicative of our current or future operating or
financial performance, our commitment to ESG standards and principles, or any future ability to service our
indebtedness including the Notes, and are only current as of the dates on which they were issued. Any ESG rating
obtained by the Group or its affiliates provides no guarantee as to the actual environmental and/or social impacts
of the Group or its affiliates. In addition, individual company ratings may be based on only publicly available
information and in other cases may be based on information supplied by the relevant companies. As such, the
quality of information in respect of each company included in our rankings may not be comparable and therefore
there may be limitations on the utility of these rankings. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the
relevance of any such ESG rating information contained in this offering memorandum or elsewhere in making an
investment decision. Moreover, ESG ratings are not a recommendation by us or any other entity or person to buy,
sell or hold the Notes. Each of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates makes no representations as to the accuracy
or validity of the ESG Risk Ratings and assume no liability with respect to the consequences of any reliance that
may be placed on this information. As of the date of this offering memorandum, none of MSCI, CDP nor EcoVadis
is subject to any regulatory or other governmental oversight in respect of its determination of ESG ratings or the
underlying methodologies it uses to make such determinations and may revise or replace entirely the methodology
it applied to derive its ESG ratings. No assurance can be given that the ESG Risk Ratings will remain constant for
any given period of time or that the ESG Risk Ratings will not be withdrawn entirely by MSCI, CDP or EcoVadis
if, in their judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. The past or future issuance of any ESG ratings which
reflect low performance on ESG matters or high ESG-related risk, or are not consistent with our own views on
our commitment to implement ESG principles and standards throughout our business and our commitment to our
business and local communities as an ESG company, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_The loss of key customers for certain products could materially affect our business._**

Although we do not rely on any single customer for a substantial portion of our revenues, if we lose any key
customers, we may be unable to find alternative buyers to purchase the same products in the same quantities, if at
all, at similar price levels and/or on the same terms.

32


-----

Although no single customer accounts for a substantial proportion of our revenues, within any given product type
or end-market we may rely on a small number of key customers. While we do not anticipate the loss of any key
customers, we may lose customers due to, among other things, industry consolidation, customer dissatisfaction or
competition, which could lead to a significant increase in inventories or decrease in our revenue and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We face certain risks relating to the loss of customers as we do not generally have long-term contracts with our
customers. With some exceptions, most of our business is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than through
long-term contracts. Accordingly, customers may elect to discontinue business with us with limited or no notice
and with limited recourse. Additionally, certain of our product lines contribute disproportionately to our
profitability. Accordingly, the loss of customers for these products could have a material adverse effect on our
financial results.

**_We may not be able to adequately protect or effectively enforce our intellectual property rights._**

Our success relies to a significant degree on our ability to identify, protect and preserve intellectual property and
other proprietary information, confidential know-how and business secrets including processes, apparatuses,
technologies, trade secrets, trade names and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods and compounds
particularly in relation to technologically sophisticated products.

We may be unable to prevent third parties from using intellectual property and other proprietary information
without authorization or independently developing similar intellectual property and other proprietary information,
particularly in those countries where the laws do not afford comprehensive protection of proprietary rights and
despite actions we take to protect our proprietary rights, including the implementation of a new trade secret policy.
Additionally, there is no guarantee that we can prevent the disclosure of business secrets.

While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect
intellectual property, such confidentiality agreements may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection
for trade secrets or proprietary know-how or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an authorized
use or disclosure of these trade secrets and know-how.

The use of the intellectual property and other proprietary information and confidential know-how by an
unauthorized third-party could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage that has been developed, cause the
loss of sales or a reduction in future profits or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. If it becomes necessary to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings
could be burdensome and costly, may divert significant management attention from the operations of our current
businesses and may not be successful.

**_Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others._**

We will continually seek to improve our business processes and develop new products and applications. Although
it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid patents of which we are aware, there could be third-party patents
that cover our products, processes or technologies, and it is possible that we could be liable for infringement of
such patents and could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such rights or to modify our processes
or technologies or re-engineer our products to continue our manufacturing and sales activities with respect to one
or more products that are found to be infringing. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable
terms, or at all, or be able to modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in a manner that is
successful in avoiding infringement. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and loses, we could be required
to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology.

We may also be subject to indemnity claims by our business partners arising out of claims of our alleged
infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties in connection with
their use of our products. Intellectual property litigation often is expensive and time consuming, regardless of the
merits of any claim, and involvement in such litigation could divert management’s attention from operating the
business. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products
and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE GLOBAL CHEMICALS AND POLYMERS INDUSTRIES**

**_The volatility and cyclicality of the global chemicals and polymers markets, including overall demand_**
**_reduction, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our business is exposed to the volatile and cyclical nature of the chemicals and polymers markets. Depending on
the individual market, and to some extent the geographic region, our businesses alternate between periods of
market growth and periods of stagnation or market decline. The transition from market growth to market decline
can be very swift. For example, although demand for NBR depends on various factors, we experienced record
demand for NBR (which customers use in the manufacturing of medical gloves) during the years ended December
31, 2020 and 2021 as a consequence of increased demand resulting from COVID-19 related health measures.
However, we subsequently experienced weaker levels of demand for NBR in the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2023, as a result of substantial glove destocking by our end-users and customers (following overstocking
during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic).

Several factors that have historically contributed to volatile results in the chemicals industry and our business,
most of which are beyond our control, include:

      - exchange, inflation and interest rate fluctuations;

      - oversupply due to unforeseen capacity expansions by existing or new competitors;

      - short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned and unplanned shutdowns;

      - regulatory requirements driving required technology and manufacturing changes; and

      - political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for energy and key raw

materials.

Uncertainty in the global economic environment (which could result in lower demand) and the implications of the
variable supply and demand balance in the chemicals industry may result in increased supply, which could
increase pressure on our margins and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
operating or financial results. For example, in the NBR gloves market, the ongoing destocking of nitrile gloves
after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increased competition (with capacity expanding in the market in China
and the rest of Asia) resulted in an overall demand reduction during 2022 and 2023. Conversely, industry-wide
capacity constraints, driven by strong demand or other factors, may lead to a rise in sales prices for raw materials
and therefore to a corresponding rise in the prices of our products, which could cause existing customers, for
certain products, to switch to substitutes or to reduce the quantities of products they purchase.

The above factors could lead to a reduction in prices and sales volumes and thus affect our sales growth and
capacity utilization, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating
or financial results.

**_Fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows_**
**_and results of operations and we may lose the ability to pass along fluctuations in raw materials and energy_**
**_prices._**

We are dependent on numerous raw materials, purchased from a diverse range of sources. The cost of raw
materials constitutes a large proportion of our total production costs. Our margins are also significantly impacted
by the relationship between the prices we are able to charge for products and the costs of the raw materials and
energy required to make and transport these products.

The prices of a majority of our raw materials by cost, such as styrene, butadiene, acrylonitrile and methyl
methacrylate are at least partially dependent on crude oil prices, which have been highly volatile and subject to
large fluctuations and sharp price movements, such as those which coincided with the onsets of both the COVID19 pandemic and Russian military action against Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, Dated Brent crude oil
averaged approximately $82 per barrel in 2023, compared to an average of approximately $99 per barrel in 2022,
$70 per barrel in 2021 and $43 per barrel in 2020. On March 8, 2022 (following the Russian military action against
Ukraine on February 24, 2022), Dated Brent crude oil reached approximately $128 per barrel. Although energy

34


-----

prices have since normalized, the energy market remains generally volatile, and may further fluctuate significantly
as a result of ongoing conflict in the Middle East and disruption to shipping lanes in the Red Sea, which may
cause cost fluctuations for our business.

Over the short-term, supply and demand balances can have an even greater impact on the pricing of raw materials.
The aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted supply chains, with some of our raw material prices
doubling for a temporary period. In addition, Russian military action against Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East
and ongoing Red Sea trade disruptions have compounded supply chain disruptions and created significant
volatility in energy costs, while demand has been dampened by inflationary pressures worldwide. Although we
are generally able to pass on raw material and energy price increases and decreases to customers, particularly in
our speciality businesses, increases in raw material and energy costs have led to, and may continue to lead to,
higher working capital levels than in the past. If the price of crude oil increases, it could result in an increase in
the prices of certain of our raw materials which we may not be able to fully pass on.

The relative scarcity of certain raw materials can also impact our results. Although we generally have multiple
global raw material suppliers, certain raw materials are available only from a small number of suppliers and in
limited circumstances only from a single source. While we use a limited number of raw materials that are available
only from a single source and orders those materials in limited quantities, the loss of any of these raw materials
could significantly impact our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized businesses.
Accordingly, sole source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply leverage.

In other cases, we choose to single source certain raw materials to obtain certain commercial advantages, including
superior pricing and terms. Any disruption in raw material availability from one of these suppliers may require us
to secure raw material supplies from alternative suppliers on less favorable terms.

Volatility in raw material or energy prices could therefore place strains on our working capital requirements.
While we seek to pass through fluctuations in raw material and energy prices to our customers, there have been
delays historically in our ability to do so. Additionally, interruptions in supply could place increased pressure on
our margins and reduce net cashflow. Either of these possibilities could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations, as well as impair our ability to fulfil our financing needs (including
the need to repay our obligations) or make further investments in our business. Any of these factors could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we do not use commodity derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of raw materials, relying
instead on our ability to pass through volatility through pricing. Since the value of our chemical products is to a
major extent determined by the raw materials that are required for the production of these products, our
profitability depends on the relationship between the sales prices for our products and the cost we incur for raw
materials. As prices for most of the raw materials we require tend to be volatile, we constantly need to adjust sale
prices, in particular in an environment of rising raw material, freight and/or energy prices, in order to maintain
sufficient profitability. In a declining price environment, demand can decline as customers postpone orders in
anticipation of further price decreases. In response to changes in demand levels, our competitors may price their
products more aggressively in order to retain market share, which can result in an adverse market environment
for us in the short-term until the market reaches a new equilibrium. There may be other unforeseen effects, which
we cannot predict given the volatility of raw or energy material prices.

**_We could continue to be affected by the possibility of disruption in our supplier relationships which could affect_**
**_our ability to source raw materials and meet the demands of our customers._**

We purchase raw materials from a diverse range of sources. However, there is always a risk that any disruption
or delay in the supply of materials from a particular supplier (including as a result of global supply disruptions)
may impact our ability to source raw materials of appropriate quality. Further, the loss of a supplier where we are
unable to find a suitable alternative, could hinder our ability to fill customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective
basis or in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenue or loss of market
share and damage to our reputation. In addition, volatility in supply and demand, costs and pricing can result in
contractual disputes with suppliers or an inability to contract on mutually satisfactory terms. Adverse resolution
of any such disputes or contract negotiations could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

35


-----

Security of energy and raw material supplies, in addition to plant availability and reliability, are critical to
maintaining supplies to our customers. These may be affected by external factors, including market shortages
(including shortage of or disruptions to container freight or other logistics modes), short and/or long-term physical
climate related disruption (including weather events and natural disasters), pandemics, global macroeconomic and
geopolitical events, terrorism, or internal events that affects plant availability, reliability or safe operations. Each
of these factors could lead to a disruption in supply to our customers and consequentially have an adverse effect
on our reputation. See “—Fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our financial
_condition, cash flows and results of operations and we may lose the ability to pass along fluctuations in raw_
_materials and energy prices.” While the supply chain disruptions resulting from Russian military action in Ukraine_
and related sanctions and the Res Sea freight disruptions have had no material impact on the security of our
existing supply chains, further disruptions or any future supply chain disruptions could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of the principal raw materials that are used in our business are derived from petrochemicals and chemical
feedstocks, which are only available from a single source. This is due to either limitations in the supply base or
logistics such as direct pipeline supply. While we use a limited number of raw materials which are available only
from a single source and despite contingency planning, the loss of any of these raw materials could significantly
impact our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized businesses. Accordingly, sole
source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply leverage. If any of our suppliers
were unable or unwilling to supply us with the raw materials required, we could experience disruptions in
production. Such disruptions could result in substantial delays if we are not able to find suitable replacement raw
materials on commercially viable terms.

The supply contracts for the major raw materials that we acquire are typically twelve-month delivery agreements
for raw materials, the majority of which are global commodities with short lived price differences between regions
due to the logistics, cost and time to store and ship products from one region to another. As a result, while we
target monthly flexibility to buy spot and contract volumes, our ability to influence the pricing mechanisms in our
supply agreements may be limited.

Many of our suppliers have operations that are subject to the SHE risks associated with the use of hazardous
materials. Any SHE related incidents affecting these suppliers may result in significant regulatory actions, fines
and other penalties, including restrictions, prohibitions or sanctions on their operations. Such consequences in
turn could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us under present or future supply agreements.

The key terms of the supply contracts for the raw materials that we acquire generally include hardship clauses and
provide some flexibility to negotiate, and although we can modify such terms to better reflect current business
conditions under certain contracts, there is a risk that this flexibility will be insufficient to adapt our contracts to
prevailing business conditions, or in a way that is suitable to us, or at all. As a general matter, if a supplier is
unable to meet our obligations under present delivery agreements, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain
the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, may not be able to obtain the raw materials at
all. Further, such incidents could also impact the ability of other suppliers to run their operations – for example, a
road traffic incident relating to a supplier of one raw material could impact the ability of other suppliers to transport
the same raw material. All of the above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We operate in highly competitive markets._**

The global chemicals and polymers markets in which we operate is highly competitive and there is significant
competition from large international producers, as well as from smaller regional competitors who may improve
their competitive position in the core end-uses by successfully introducing new products, improving their
manufacturing processes or expanding their capacity or manufacturing facilities. We may be unable to keep pace
with competitors’ product and manufacturing process innovations and efficiencies. For example, we have recently
experienced increased competition in China and the rest of Asia, as a result of increased capacity from competitors
looking to benefit from close access to those growing markets.

Competition between producers of chemicals and polymers can result in significant pressure on prices which may
adversely affect sales volumes, revenues and margins. Moreover, in response to changes in demand for products
in a declining price environment, our competitors may price their products more aggressively in order to retain

36


-----

market share, which can result in an adverse market environment in the short-term until the market reaches a new
equilibrium. All of this may in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating or financial
results. In addition, if the markets for our products expand, there may be an increase in new competitors and
existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we will operate, further enhancing
existing competition. The resulting pressure of increased competition on margins could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition, operating or financial results and cash flow.

Furthermore, a number of our customers are participants in markets that are undergoing consolidation. We could
lose individual customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or consolidated with, other companies that have
relationships with our competitors.

**_If we are not able to continue the technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new_**
**_products, our customers may turn to other producers in order to meet their requirements._**

Our ability to compete is, and will remain, highly dependent on our ability to develop technological innovations
and to introduce new products to satisfy the demands of our customers. In future, alternative materials and
technologies could be developed, or existing materials and technologies improved, which could be used in place
of the products and technologies supplied by us.

If new types of materials or technologies with favorable characteristics are developed or existing materials or
technologies are improved by other producers, or if technological developments or improvements in processes
result in competitors being able to offer products at lower prices than the products we offer, there is a risk that
customers could replace products with materials or technologies offered by competitors. If, in this case, we are
not in a position to compete on the basis of quality, product features and/or price, this could lead to substantial
declines in sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

In addition, our customers may introduce new generations of their own products or require new technological and
increased performance specifications that would require the development of customized products.

Innovation or other changes in customers’ product performance requirements may also adversely affect the
demand for the products. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial
and technological progress in all key end-use markets, and upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture
and market products in such changing end-use markets.

We need to continue to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to replace existing
products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position and to meet our customers evolving
environmental goals and requirements. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to
modify products in response to customers’ needs (including as a result of changing environmental requirements),
then our business, financial condition and operating or financial results could be materially adversely affected as
a result of the associated reduction in sales and profitability.

**_Adverse and uncertain global economic and geopolitical conditions, including factors affecting our, and our_**
**_customers’ and suppliers’ access to credit, could negatively impact our business and ability to borrow or raise_**
**_capital._**

Our business and the products that we sell may be impacted by fluctuations in consumer demand in the endmarkets where our customers operate, the global economic environment, geopolitical conditions, changes in
interest rates and instability in securities markets around the world, among other factors. Adverse economic
conditions can affect consumer and business spending generally. In particular, a worsening economic climate can
result in a decreased demand in the markets in which our products are used.

The supply-demand balance in the markets where we compete and prices for raw materials are strongly influenced
by the overall economic conditions in Europe, North America and Asia. Global financial markets and economic
conditions have been severely disrupted and volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant
vulnerabilities, such as the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt, continued
leverage and liquidity issues in the banking sector (including the risk of bank failures, insolvencies or government
regulatory interventions) and a limited supply of credit. The industry in which we operate has experienced
challenging conditions recently, including high inflation, as a result of global geopolitical and macroeconomic

37


-----

events. This has led to weaker overall demand in our end-markets, especially in segments for durable end-use
products. An extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or in any of
the markets in which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect
our business.

Moreover, Russian military action in Ukraine has exacerbated the above challenges due to, among other things,
the impact on supply chains, concerns over European energy supply, increased energy costs and higher inflation
rates among other macroeconomic developments in many of the markets where we are active. Russia’s recognition
of separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and subsequent military action against
Ukraine have led to an unprecedented expansion of sanction programs by the UK, the European Union, the US,
Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus and such separatist republics, which in
turn has reduced gas pipeline supply to Europe from Russia. While such volumes may be compensated for through
liquid natural gas imports, this is subject to global pricing, and depends on the availability of infrastructure, levels
of gas storage and demand, which is primarily driven by weather conditions. Although we have reduced our gas
demand through the use of alternative fuels either directly or working with site utility service suppliers where
possible, further increases in the cost of energy could reduce the competitiveness of our business, and in particular,
our European operations, as a result of increased production costs and our inability to pass on these costs to
customers, given increased competition from other regions.

Similarly, a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial position, as a result of adverse economic
conditions or otherwise, could increase our credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability
to collect accounts receivable from that customer. Continued weakness in the global economy for a significant
period of time, or a further deterioration of global economic conditions, could result in our customers experiencing
less profitability in their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty in obtaining financing, which may
ultimately lead to liquidations or bankruptcies. Any of these occurrences could cause us to limit or discontinue
business with those customers. Our suppliers may also experience similar conditions, which could impact their
ability to fulfil their obligations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Furthermore, a number of our customers and suppliers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations,
which may be limited due to adverse economic conditions. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities,
including as a result of global economic volatility or tightening credit markets, may adversely affect our business
by reducing sales and increasing exposure to bad debt, therefore reducing profitability. In addition, the inability
of our suppliers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our business by increasing prices for raw material
and transportation, which could have an adverse effect on margins.

In addition, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing or
credit at favorable terms in order to fulfil our financing needs (including the need to refinance or repay debt
obligations, including the Notes). If we are unable to refinance or repay our debt obligations or access the credit
and capital markets, we may not be able to pursue certain aspects of our business plans, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—We may not be able to
_implement our business strategy or fully capitalize upon our investments in progress” and “Risks Relating to our_
_Financial Position—We may not be able to refinance maturing debt on terms that are as favorable as those from_
_which we previously benefited or on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.”_

**_We are subject to the risks associated with international trade, including various geopolitical events and_**
**_fluctuations in the global economy._**

The sale, purchase and shipment of components and products across international borders subject us to extensive
governmental trade regulations.

We are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional
costs, penalties or liabilities. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies, as well as changes in export and
other incentives given by various governments or import or tariff policies to restrictions in trade, could adversely
affect our results. Imposition of any additional taxes and levies could adversely affect the demand for our products.
These may be affected by geopolitical events, including instability within the Eurozone, uncertainty as to the
global effect of the current US trade and tariff policies, strained international relations (including Russian military
action in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East) and widespread increases in global tariffs.

38


-----

Additional developments may also occur that we cannot currently know about or anticipate, or that may be
impossible to plan for or protect against. The effects of such geopolitical events may include further financial
instability and slower economic growth, significant regulatory changes, currency fluctuations and inflation in the
global economy. Inability to manage these risks could harm our growth prospects.

**_We are exposed to local business and political risks in the countries in which we operate._**

We sell and market our products in the UK, Europe, North America, Asia (including China), and to a lesser extent,
other parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. We also currently have active manufacturing
facilities located in a number of locations, including the UK, the United States, Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain,
France, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Vietnam, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. We
employ sales staff and agents strategically located around the world to serve our global customer base, as well as
maintaining foreign R&D facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations. Our business is therefore
subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:
unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions, including their
interpretation; adverse changes in the general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which
we operate; difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights; compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in
various jurisdictions becoming burdensome; increasing transportation and other shipping costs, delays or
interruptions, including as a result of geopolitical developments; variations in business practices; the imposition
of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other restrictions on foreign
trade or investment, including currency exchange controls; instability and disruptions caused by actual or
threatened export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses; staffing difficulties,
national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes; the threat of government expropriation; region to region
fluctuations in key raw material costs; difficulties in staffing and managing operations; the imposition of any price
controls or anti-dumping rulings; litigation risk and possible loss contingencies arising from the aftershocks of the
COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects, including commercial contract disputes, employee matters, contract
counterparty insolvency, force majeure, insurance claims and other arrangements; the imposition of government
restrictions on movement or gatherings; and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables.

We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors
in a timely and effective manner at each location where we do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or
more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our
business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

We have operations in developing countries such as Malaysia and may expand our business and operations into
other high growth emerging markets, including other parts of Asia. Our operations in developing countries are
subject to the risks inherent in operating in developing countries, including legal and regulatory uncertainties
(such as difficulties in securing intellectual property rights), political instability or conflict, as well as rapid
changes in economic or political conditions in emerging markets, which may result in greater risks of inflation,
fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, and a negative impact on the demand for our products.

**RISKS RELATING TO REGULATION AND LEGISLATION**

**_Compliance with safety, health and environment (“SHE”) laws and regulations and the retention of requisite_**
**_permits related to our facilities and operations could result in significant ongoing costs and may result in_**
**_further obligations and liabilities associated with our business._**

We are subject to a wide range of SHE laws and regulations that govern our facilities and operations, including
those introduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such regulations govern activities including the
manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,
wastewater discharges, greenhouse gas emissions, noise emissions, operation and closure of landfills, human
health and safety, process safety and risk management and the clean-up of contaminated sites and are present in
all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our operations also require permits and controls to monitor
or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities
and are frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of improvement works at the relevant
sites. Typically, these permits require continuous compliance with certain conditions in order to maintain the
permit, and they may include requirements and conditions which have not yet been finally determined, which
could result in significant additional costs or environmental obligations for us. We may periodically also not be

39


-----

in compliance with certain permit requirements while it takes time for us to get back into compliance. We have
incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance
with current and future SHE laws and regulations.

In addition, in connection with the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business, we have inherited certain
environmental liabilities connected to the Jefferson Hills Site (as a result of contamination and non-compliance
with certain SHE laws and regulations (the “Jefferson Hills Environmental Liabilities”)). During the due
diligence stage of acquisition, it was disclosed that the US Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) had
identified these issues and required a consent order to be made to address them. The Consent Decree was signed
and entered as a final judgment on July 24, 2023 and outlined external audit requirements, compliance plans and
the payment of a civil penalty of $2.4 million. Although we have secured certain protections from Eastman (for
example, Eastman has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain expenditure arising out of EPA enforcement
action and will pay all related fines and penalties, including the initial civil penalty of $2.4 million), we have made
provisions for the Jefferson Hills Environmental Liabilities over a ten-year period. The balance of such provisions
as of December 31, 2023 was $7.7 million. However, it is not possible to estimate with accuracy the quantum of
costs likely to be incurred in complying with the terms of the Consent Decree.

The SHE laws, regulations and permits that govern our operations also tend to become increasingly stringent over
time, and we could in the future assume additional obligations and therefore incur substantial incremental costs
to ensure our continued regulatory compliance. If we do not accurately predict and adequately provision for the
amount or timing of costs of any future compliance or if we misinterpret our obligations under any of these
regulatory changes, we may find ourselves in violation of SHE laws, regulations or permits. Given the nature of
our business, violations of SHE requirements, whether current or future, may result in substantial fines or
penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs and other remediation or restoration
requirements, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control
equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities. The impact on our business,
financial condition or results of operations in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_Compliance with extensive and evolving SHE laws and other regulations relating to the manufacture and_**
**_production of our products may require substantial expenditures and may impact demand for such products._**

We use large quantities of hazardous substances and generates hazardous wastes in its manufacturing operations.
Consequently, our operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at
both the national and local level in multiple jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating or financial results and cash flows. In particular jurisdictions, including the UK, the
US and the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly
demanding and it is expected that this trend will continue.

Our products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into and/or sold in the European Union
are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety
analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation concerning the Registration,
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006) (“REACH”) (as
amended and updated from time to time), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole
with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and the registration of building block and semi-speciality
chemicals. REACH is reviewed annually and as a result, new regulations that further impact our businesses and
operations may be proposed and implemented in the future. Following Brexit, the regulatory requirements under
REACH have been substantially integrated into United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of REACH etc.
(Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“UK **REACH”), which has applied since January 1, 2021. UK**
REACH operates independently from REACH, and operators in the chemicals industry must therefore comply
with their obligations under both regimes. In the future, the framework of UK REACH may diverge significantly
from REACH, in which case we would be required to comply with additional requirements. In addition, the
European Union Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) (“CLP”),
imposes further obligations in relation to the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals. Following
Brexit, the regulatory requirements under CLP have been substantially integrated into United Kingdom domestic
law by virtue of Retained CLP Regulation (EU) No. 1272/2008 as amended for Great Britain (“GB CLP”), which
has applied since January 1, 2021. GB CLP operates independently from CLP and operators in the chemicals
industry must therefore comply with their obligations under both regimes. In the future, the framework of GB

40


-----

CLP may diverge significantly from CLP, in which case we would be required to comply with additional
requirements.

As of December 31, 2023, we have registered 141 substances currently required to be registered under EU
REACH. Under UK REACH, we have grandfathered 48 registrations and declared 515 substances on our
Downstream User Import Notification (“DUIN”). However, we still expect to incur certain ongoing compliance
costs as well as costs associated with the registration of any applicable new products. In connection with REACH,
UK REACH, CLP and GB CLP requirements, any raw material, chemical or substance, including our products,
as well as being subject to the registration, classification, labelling and packaging requirements that these
regulations impose, could be classified as having a toxicological or health related impact on the environment,
users of our products or employees. In particular, REACH requires a costly and time-consuming authorization
process for any chemical that has been deemed to be a Substance of Very High Concern and which has been listed
by the European Commission in Annex XIV of REACH, in order for that chemical to remain on the market.
Inclusion of a product in Annex XIV of REACH triggers various obligations to produce information on the product
and its properties to customers and downstream users. As part of the authorization process, we would have to
demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated with uses of this substance are adequately
controlled or that the socio-economic benefits of its use outweigh the risks. We must also analyze whether there
are safer suitable alternatives or technologies available. If authorization is obtained, it will only be for a limited
period after which there is a risk that such authorization will not be renewed or that an alternative would have
been found.

In the US, our operations are subject to federal and state regulation of chemicals, including the TSCA. In recent
years, there have been a number of proposals to amend significantly or reform the TSCA that have been introduced
in the US, including via federal legislation and EPA-managed initiatives. On June 22, 2016, legislation
significantly amending TSCA was enacted into law. TSCA allows screening of our products by the EPA, which
increases the risk of screening that may lead to a range of regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including a
possible prohibition on manufacture and sale. In addition, certain of our feedstock products, such as butadiene
and formaldehyde, are also subject to the EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluation.

Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our
respective products, could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. In addition, changes in regulations,
health and safety concerns could increase the costs incurred by customers to use our products and otherwise limit
the use of these products, which could lead to decreased demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand
likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results. As
outlined above, the process of seeking regulatory approval of certain new products and production processes can
be time consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant delays, and such approvals may ultimately not be
granted at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect
our ability to introduce new products, to continue distributing existing products, and to generate net sales from
those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Moreover, many of our
customers are subject to similar regulations. If a significant customer or group of customers were to have an
important permit, license, registration or authorization revoked, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

The factors mentioned above could, either individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and operating or financial results and could, in addition, harm our reputation and customer
relations. If we do not accurately predict and adequately provision for the amount or timing of costs of any future
compliance or if we misinterpret our obligations under any of these regulatory changes, we may find ourselves in
violation of laws, regulations or permits. Given the nature of the business, violations of environmental, health and
safety requirements, whether current or future, may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of other
civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs and other remediation or restoration requirements, claims for personal
injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the
suspension of, operating permits or activities. The impact on our business or our financial condition or results of
operations in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, regulators and our employees with_**
**_respect to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices may impose additional costs on us or_**
**_expose us to new or additional risks and the ESG metrics we use to gauge compliance may not prove to be_**
**_effective measures of ESG compliance._**

There is increasing focus, including from governmental and regulatory organizations, investors, employees and
customers, on ESG issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity and inclusion, racial
justice and workplace conduct. Negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social
media could damage our reputation if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these ESG issues.
Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of our customers
and our partners to do business with us.

In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have
developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Unfavorable ratings of
the Group or our market may lead to negative investor, customer or employee sentiment, which could lead to the
diversion of investment or business to other companies or industries. Further, we could fail to achieve targets set
as part of the “Vision 2030” plan or have our ESG ratings downgraded, including our “AA” ESG rating from
MSCI, our CDP Climate score of A- (Leadership Category), our “Green Economy” mark (which is awarded by
the London Stock Exchange to companies that earn more than 50% of our revenue from products that contribute
to environmental objectives), or our silver rating from EcoVadis (a provider of business sustainability ratings).

Moreover, ESG ratings, including the MSCI, CDP, “Green Economy” and EcoVadis ratings described above, may
vary among the different ESG ratings organizations and are subject to differing methodologies, assumptions and
priorities used by such organizations to assess ESG performance and risks. There is no guarantee that the
methodology used by any particular ESG rating provider will conform with the expectations or requirements of
any particular investor or customer, or any present or future applicable standards, recommendations, criteria, laws,
regulations, guidelines or listing rules. ESG rating providers may revise or replace entirely the methodology they
apply to derive ESG ratings or they may employ methodologies which are not transparent, any of which could
cause confusion among investors and customers. Such methodologies may have difficulties in comparing
information on our ESG performance with other industry participants. As a result, our ESG ratings are not
necessarily indicative of our past, current or future commitment to, or performance in respect of, ESG topics.
Further, ESG ratings may have limited, if any, utility for investors in assessing our past, current or future financial
performance. As a result, any negative ESG related attention, a failure to live up to current standards, achieve
ESG targets or negative reports around the metrics we use to assess our ESG performance, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating or financial results.

**_We may be subject to ongoing costs and regulations related to contamination or exposure impacts from our_**
**_operations or products._**

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities. Some
environmental laws, regulations and court decisions impose liability on present and former owners, operators or
users of, or the generators of waste disposed at, facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites
without regard to causation, negligence or knowledge of contamination. Historically, environmental assessments
of certain of our sites have revealed recognized environmental conditions and from time to time, our internal
audits have shown instances of regulatory noncompliance and recommendations of remediation. There are
significant costs associated with such remediation as well as with general compliance with increasingly stringent
environmental regulations. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new
obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at or in connection with our facilities, could result in
substantial costs. For example, as a result of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business from Eastman, and
in order to comply with the Consent Decree, as of December 31, 2023, we have made provision for the Jefferson
Hills Environmental Liabilities for liabilities associated with the Jefferson Hills Site over a ten year period, the
majority of which we expect to utilize within the next three years. The provision balance as of December 31, 2023
was $7.7 million. However, it is not possible to estimate with accuracy the quantum of costs likely to be incurred
in complying with the terms of the Consent Decree. See “—Compliance with safety, health and environment
_(“SHE”) laws and regulations and the retention of requisite permits related to our facilities and operations could_
_result in significant ongoing costs and may result in further obligations and liabilities associated with our_
_business.”_

42


-----

While we are protected by contractual indemnities from prior owners or operators against some environmental
liabilities related to known contamination or have insurance coverage relating to such costs, there is a risk that we
will be unable to recover all potential costs under such indemnity provisions or insurance contracts in all cases.
See “—Uninsured losses, losses in excess of our insurance coverage for certain risks and unanticipated changes
_in our insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of_
_operations.” We could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or_
liabilities and, if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impacts on our
business, financial condition and results of operations in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could
be material.

**_Conducting operations and sales in several different countries exposes us, and our facilities to various_**
**_regulatory risks within each jurisdiction._**

Our operations in emerging markets could expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks that are greater
than those we may face in established markets. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations,
such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 (“Bribery Act”), the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and
applicable laws and regulations. Any failure by us to ensure that our employees, intermediaries or any third party
acting on our behalf to comply with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign
jurisdictions, including those relating to anti-competitive behavior and breaches of trade sanctions, could result in
substantial civil and criminal penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign
jurisdictions and reputational damage, and our business, financial condition and operating or financial results
could be materially adversely affected.

From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries and joint ventures have engaged in limited sales to countries subject
to sanctions laws, including Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, the Ivory Coast, Myanmar, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Russia and
Belarus (the “Sanctioned Countries”). Such sales represented an insignificant amount of our total revenues sales
in 2023 and we: (i) have not engaged in sales to Iran since the reintroduction of sanctions in 2018; and (ii) in
September 2022 suspended all sales to Russia and Belarus. Where sales have been (before a change in our policy)
or are made into Sanctioned Countries, these sales have not violated restrictions, and are in compliance with, any
applicable economic sanctions or export controls.

While we operate a due diligence process and offer dedicated sanctions guidance to our internal stakeholders with
respect to the Sanctioned Countries, laws, regulations or licensing policies on economic sanctions or export
controls, these could change in a way that could affect our business, exports or sales in such countries and/or could
result in restrictions, penalties or fines. Non-compliance with current or future applicable laws or regulations could
result in civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may not be able to carry out acquisitions or mergers due to regulatory restrictions on business acquisitions_**
**_and mergers or we may become subject to antitrust regulations as a consequence of our position in certain_**
**_markets._**

Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust authorities under antitrust
regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of jurisdictions. If such approvals of a proposed acquisition
or merger prove necessary, approval may require, based on the relevant antirust authority’s evaluation of
prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that we divest certain businesses in order to carry out
the transaction or we may be prohibited from carrying out the transaction.

Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and our business, financial
condition and operating or financial results. For example, as a condition to clearance of our acquisition of
OMNOVA by the European antitrust regulatory authorities, we were required to divest our small VP latex business
in Germany. Our participation in the international marketplaces for raw materials and speciality chemicals may
be subject to scrutiny by antitrust regulators and other regulatory bodies under antitrust legislation.

**_We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities._**

Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Significant
judgement and estimation are required in determining worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary

43


-----

course of our business there are various transactions and calculations, including intercompany transactions and
cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to
interpretation. We are regularly audited by tax authorities, who may disagree with tax estimates or judgements.
The final determination of any such tax audits could differ from historical income tax provisions and accruals and
any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating or financial results. It is difficult to assess in advance the likelihood of
any adverse final judgments or outcomes arising out of any proceedings with national or regional tax authorities
to which we are or may in the future be subject.

Legislation has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions to adopt and
implement “Pillar Two” of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project, which was initiated by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) to introduce a global minimum tax rate of
15% for certain multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) with a global consolidated revenue of at least €750 million.
In December 2021 and March 2022, the OECD published model rules and related commentary to support member
jurisdictions of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (including the United Kingdom) to implement the
Pillar Two framework. The United Kingdom has legislated to implement the Pillar Two income inclusion rule by
introducing a “multinational top-up tax” and a “qualified domestic top-up tax” for certain “qualifying
multinational groups” for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The new rules are complex
and the Issuer would need certain financial and tax data from all relevant constituent entities, which may not be
readily available. As such Legislative changes related to Pillar Two may increase our liability to taxes.

In addition, changes in tax legislation or guidance could affect our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax
assets or the deferred tax liabilities. Any tax audit, tax proceeding or changes in tax legislation or guidance could,
as a result of any of the above risks, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating or
financial results.

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION**

**_We may operate with a level of leverage that could affect our ability to implement our strategy and, as a result,_**
**_adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

During the last two years, several factors have significantly increased our leverage. We completed a major
acquisition in early 2022, predominantly financed from debt, which was subsequently followed by a rapid
deterioration in market conditions, which has significantly, but temporarily, weakened our recent performance.
To navigate the current challenging environment, we have taken substantial and decisive actions to preserve cash
and manage debt. In October 2023, we completed the Rights Offering and raised approximately £276 million in
gross proceeds and approximately £261 million in net proceeds (after deduction of estimated commissions, fees
and expenses). The net proceeds were initially utilized to reduce borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility
and provide flexibility to deliver our strategy and manage balance sheet leverage. In addition to the rights offering,
we completed the strategic divestment of our non-core Laminates and Films and Coated Fabrics Business in
February 2023, as announced in December 2022, for $269 million (including $262 million (£218.5 million) of
cash consideration after transaction costs received at completion and utilized to repay existing debt, a further $5
million receivable in cash on the 13-month anniversary of completion and other working capital settlement related
receivable and remaining transaction costs payable). In addition, in March 2024, we agreed with our lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities to extend the period of temporary covenant relaxation to
ensure appropriate headroom was maintained. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

Notwithstanding the successful execution of these mitigation actions, our covenant leverage position remains
elevated compared to historical levels. Pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, we are
required to comply with certain financial covenants which include the requirement that our ratio of net debt
divided by EBITDA shall not exceed (i) 6.00x as of June 30, 2024; (ii) 5.75x as of December 31, 2024; and (iii)
conditional on the refinancing of not less than €300 million of Existing Notes, 5.0x as of June 30, 2025, 4.75x as
of December 31, 2025, 3.5x as of June 30, 2026 and 3.25x at each six month interval thereafter. As at December
31, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, our as adjusted net borrowings (including lease liabilities) would
have been £561.0 million and our ratio of _as adjusted_ net borrowings (including lease liabilities) to EBITDA
would have been 3.9x. For computation of our ratio of as adjusted net borrowings to EBITDA, see “Summary
_Financial and Other Information.” We intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance_

sheet, to (i) repurchase or redeem certain of the Existing Notes and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related
to the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

We have, and will continue to have, interest-bearing debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we have
a net debt of £499.7 million. Furthermore, we may incur additional debt, including in connection with a
refinancing of existing debt for general corporate purposes or in connection with the balancing of our portfolio.

Our leverage can have important consequences for our business and operations, including:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to
cash flow;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

  - restricting us from investing in strategic initiatives, growing our business and exploiting certain business
opportunities; and

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs
of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness that could further increase our leverage and may have terms that are_**
**_more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt, for
general corporate purposes or, to the extent permitted under our existing debt agreements, to fund any future
acquisition. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and
we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from
time to time. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form
of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document.
The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such
debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt,
including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect
on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will
be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the
Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant
lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes or our other existing
indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to
raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence,
the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt and the Notes,
the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this
“Risk Factors” section, could intensify.

45

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Among other things, the Indenture will limit our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

  - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

  - make certain other restricted payments;

  - create or permit to exist certain liens;

  - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

  - transfer or sell assets;

  - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and

  - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, we are subject to certain covenants and events of default under the terms of its debt arrangements. In
particular, pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, we are required to comply with
certain financial covenants which include the requirement that our ratio of net debt divided by EBITDA shall not
exceed (i) 6.00x as of June 30, 2024; (ii) 5.75x as of December 31, 2024; and (iii) conditional on the refinancing
of not less than €300 million of Existing Notes, 5.0x as of June 30, 2025, 4.75x as of December 31, 2025, 3.5x as
of June 30, 2026 and 3.25x at each six month interval thereafter (the “Debt Covenants”). In addition, there are
also a number of covenants that restrict some of our corporate activities, including restrictions on mergers and
demergers, paying dividends and granting security. These covenants are, in most cases, subject to certain
exceptions and qualifications. However, despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we
are subject could materially adversely affect our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may
be in our interest.

According to projections of our financial position in our "base case" scenario (as opposed to "reasonable worst
case" scenario detailed above), including certain cash saving measures, comprising employee incentive
reductions, growth capex reductions and working capital management, we would not expect to breach Debt
Covenants during the working capital period. However, these cash saving measures are likely to restrict our ability
to implement our strategy and/or limit the benefits realized from any successful partial implementation.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” These covenants could limit our_
ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business
activities that may be in our interest.

If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, we will be in default under the Indenture, the Existing Indenture
the Revolving Credit Facility, the UKEF Facilities and/or the relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and
the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or the applicable creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest
on the Notes or the applicable amounts due and payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such
default could lead to an event of default and acceleration under our other debt instruments that contain crossdefault or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. These restrictions could materially adversely
affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in
our best interest. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.”_

**_Any impairment of our ability to draw funds under the Revolving Credit Facility or the UKEF Facilities could_**
**_materially adversely affect our business operations._**

Our operations have been primarily financed using cash generated in our operations and debt financing. Following
the Transactions, we will rely on existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and any
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or the UKEF Facilities for our general and working capital
purposes. Further, if we were unable to draw funds under the Revolving Credit Facility or the UKEF Facilities,
we may need to find alternative sources of funds, which may be at higher interest rates. There also can be no
assurance that we will have sufficient cash resources on hand at any given time to meet our expenses or debt
servicing requirements. Our ability to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities depends on,
among other things, our ability to satisfy certain financial covenants. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and
other required conditions to drawing could be affected by a number of factors, including by events beyond our
control. In addition, our inability to maintain these financial ratios may also result in an event of default under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the UKEF Facilities Agreement, which would prohibit us from
drawing funds under those facilities and potentially trigger a cross-default under the Indenture or our other debt
instruments. See “—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future
_operations and capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities” above. This inability to draw funds_
under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the UKEF Facilities or to maintain our operations due to a lack of cash
flow could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate
cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service
our debt.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital and to make
capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends on the success of our business strategy and on economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, as well as the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are
beyond our control.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future
debt or equity financings will be available to us to pay our debt, including payments due under the Notes and the
Guarantees, or to fund our other capital requirements or any operating losses. If our future cash flows from
operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF
Facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced
to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures;

  - sell assets;

  - suspend shareholder dividends;

  - obtain additional debt or equity capital;

  - restructure or refinance all or part of our debt, including the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the
UKEF Facilities, on or before maturity; or

  - forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

We can provide no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business and adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of can

47


-----

be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale will be
acceptable.

**_We may not be able to refinance maturing debt on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously_**
**_benefited or on terms that are acceptable to us or at all._**

The Notes will mature in 2029 and the Existing Notes mature in 2025 and each of the UKEF Facilities and the
Revolving Credit Facility matures in 2027. See “Description of Other Indebtedness and Financing
_Arrangements.” At the respective maturity dates of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes, the UKEF_
Facilities or any other debt which we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other
capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance
or restructure our indebtedness. Our ability to refinance our debt depends on a number of factors, including the
liquidity and capital conditions in the credit markets, and we may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, or at
all. In the event that we cannot refinance our debt, we may not to be able to meet our debt repayment obligations.
In addition, the terms of any refinancing indebtedness may be materially more burdensome to us than the
indebtedness it refinances. Such terms, including additional restrictions on our operations and higher interest rates,
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “—We may operate with a
_level of leverage that could affect our ability to implement our strategy, and as a result, could materially adversely_
_affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.”_

Furthermore, our inability to meet repayment obligations under the existing agreements could trigger various
cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, resulting in the acceleration of a substantial portion (if not all) of
our debt, including the Notes, and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies and are dependent upon cash flow from_**
**_subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies with limited business operations and are dependent
upon the receipt of sufficient funds from their subsidiaries in the form of dividends or distributions to meet their
obligations, including obligations under the Notes and Guarantees, as applicable. The amounts of dividends and
distributions available to each holding company will depend upon the profitability and cash flows of its
subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law.

Although the Indenture will restrict the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries from entering into certain future
consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant
qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. However, various agreements governing our debt may restrict
the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject
such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will
be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or as loans or as payments under profit
and loss pooling agreements, or even prevent such payments. In addition, financial assistance or corporate benefit
restrictions may prevent upstream payments being made to the Issuer by its subsidiaries to enable the Issuer to
service its obligations under the Notes. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no
obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their
respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, have sufficient resources to
meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted
group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_We are subject to currency and interest rate risks._**

We are also subject to interest rate risks as we have certain interest determined on a variable basis, either through
unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the UKEF Facilities Agreement are indexed to variable rates and expose us to direct interest rate
risks that could lead to a material increase in our obligations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will,
or will be able to, hedge our full exposure or that our hedging transactions will be effective. The use of derivatives
is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with
our ordinary business. Depending on market conditions and movements in interest rates, our use of hedging
transactions could enhance or harm our overall performance compared to our competitors. In addition, are subject

48


-----

to the creditworthiness of the counterparties under our hedging transactions, and we will be exposed to the risk of
insolvency or default on the part of our hedge counterparties. We are subject to certain limited currency exchange
rate risks because a majority of our revenues and operating expenses are paid in currencies other than the pound
sterling, including euro, US dollars, and the Malaysian ringgit. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Synthomer—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on_
_Market Risk.”_

**_We are subject to credit risks._**

We are exposed to various credit risks and other financial risks that may have a negative impact on our operating
results. Due to the nature of our operations, we are creditors to numerous counterparties, including our customers,
investments in joint ventures, which subjects us to credit risk associated with those counterparties. These
contractual arrangements, deposits or other financial instruments expose us to credit risk on the amounts due from
such counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk could materially affect our financial condition and results of
operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
_Synthomer—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES AND THE GUARANTEES**

**_The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of our_**
**_non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, on the Issue Date, the Notes will be jointly and
severally guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to
applicable laws, the Guarantors also guarantee the obligations under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility and the UKEF Facilities, in each case, on a senior basis. The Guarantees will be subject to certain material
limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.” Only the Guarantors will provide the_
Guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the Notes on the Issue Date. Other subsidiaries of the Issuer may
guarantee the Notes in the future, but until then, any claim by us or any of our creditors, including the holders of
the Notes, against any such non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of
creditors of such subsidiaries. The Indenture will not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments
in, any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein), including our subsidiaries that do not provide guarantees
for the Notes, which subsidiaries could account for a higher portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and net
results in the future.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Guarantors generated 65.2% of our EBITDA. As of December 31,
2023, the total borrowings of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, on as pro forma basis giving effect to the Offering,
including the application of the net proceeds therefrom, and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under
"Use of Proceeds," were nil. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of these nonguarantor subsidiaries, creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full
from their respective assets before the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is entitled to receive any distribution from
such assets as equity holders. Except to the extent that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors may itself be a creditor
with recognized claims against a non-guarantor subsidiary, claims of creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims of the Issuer or the
Guarantors as equity holders, although there is no assurance that the claims of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
as a creditor against a non-guarantor subsidiary may not be reduced, limited, subordinated or extinguished as a
result of applicable insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of equitable subordination or the rules regarding the
potential avoidance of transactions concluded with related persons within a certain hardening period). Our nonguarantor subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business, which liabilities are also effectively senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors will have priority with respect to their collateral_**
**_over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets_**
**_securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets. As a result,
claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors will have priority with respect to the assets securing

49


-----

their indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness
or other obligations (except to the extent such assets in the future also secure the Notes and the Guarantees on an
equal and rateable basis or priority basis). In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at a
time when it has secured obligations, holders of secured indebtedness will have priority claims to the assets of the
Issuer or such Guarantor that constitute their collateral (other than to the extent such assets in the future also secure
the Notes and the Guarantees on an equal and rateable basis). The holders of the Notes will participate rateably
with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and potentially with all their other
respective general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be. The claims of holders of the Notes and other unsecured
creditors will also depend on whether there is any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets.
If any of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed
against the operating assets that secure such indebtedness, our assets remaining after repayment of that secured
indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders of
Notes may receive less, rateably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer or the Guarantors.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade by at
least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Inc., provided
at such time no default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants will be suspended
for the duration of the period during which the Notes maintain an investment grade rating and include covenants
that restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, to incur debt and to enter into certain other
transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated
investment grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. Suspension of these covenants, however, would allow us
to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force, and such
transactions will not result in a breach of the Indenture if the Notes fail to maintain an investment grade rating.
See "Description of the Notes—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status."

**_Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes._**

The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as more fully described in "Description of the Notes." In
the event that the Issuer exercises the option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer a lower than
expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.

**_Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_**
**_or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limit validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However,
the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor,
voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantor to incur
personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses and laws. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit and
uncommercial transactions, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, transaction at undervalue,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no
liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and
applicable law. Further, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Malaysian Guarantor has not yet obtained
approval from the Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) (“BNM”) to provide its Guarantee. In the
absence of BNM’s written approval, and to the extent that amounts guaranteed by the Malaysian Guarantor exceed
MYR50 million equivalent in a calendar year, such Guarantee may only be enforced upon a declaration of an
event of default under the Notes. The Guarantee and any other guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability
granted or undertaken by the Malaysian Guarantor, or over any of the shares or quotas of, or any credit rights
over, the Malaysian Guarantor, shall be limited to a global maximum amount (that will not be higher, but may be

50


-----

lower, than €10 million (which is, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately MYR50 million)),
and, as a result, the Malaysian Guarantor will not have an obligation to repay any amounts to the holders of the
Notes under such Guarantee and any other guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability once the relevant
maximum amount has been reached, as applicable. See "Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations."

As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending
on the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general under bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance
and similar laws in England and Wales, Germany Italy and Malaysia, Guarantees can be challenged and a court
could (i) declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void any legal act
performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Guarantees) and/or subordinate
the Guarantee, (ii) require, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee, that the recipient (and possibly,
subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor and (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found, inter alia, that:

  - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference over another when the
Guarantors contemplated filing for insolvency or the Guarantors subsequently entered an insolvency
process or when the recipient was (or should have been) aware that the Guarantor was insolvent or it
would be rendered insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

  - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or consideration of equivalent value in money or money’s
worth or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of
the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity;

  - the Guarantor incurred debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature;

  - the relevant Guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency varies depending in the law applied, see "Certain Insolvency and Enforceability
_Considerations."_

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee
not constituting a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. See "Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations." However,
we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was "insolvent" at
the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was
insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

If a court decided that a guarantee or payment under a guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance and voided such guarantee or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any
claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any
other Guarantor under the relevant guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is
invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations
apply, the Notes, would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and if we cannot
satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can repay in full the amounts outstanding
under the Notes.

51


-----

These or similar laws may also apply to any other guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries under the Indenture.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts could limit the enforceability of any
Guarantee against any Guarantor. See "Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations."

**_The granting of the Guarantees or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart_**
**_hardening periods and the Guarantees may be challenged or voidable in accordance with the laws applicable_**
**_in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of Guarantees may create hardening periods for such Guarantees in certain jurisdictions. The
applicable hardening period for new Guarantees would typically run from the moment each new Guarantee has
been granted or perfected and/or any new indebtedness guaranteed by such Guarantee has been incurred.

The Guarantees may be voidable by the relevant Guarantors or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or
administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances
exist or occur, including, amongst others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the
grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an
insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified hardening period
following the grant. At each time, if a Guarantee is to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
period applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible
to enforce it. To the extent that any Guarantee is voided, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of such
Guarantee. The holders of the Notes may also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such
Guarantee or release such Guarantee.

In order to effectively secure future indebtedness, including Additional Notes under the Indenture it may be
necessary to create additional Guarantees or amend the relevant Guarantee at the time such indebtedness is
incurred. Any such Guarantee or amendments and any Guarantee in relation to any future indebtedness will likely
be subject to new hardening periods and, consequently, to potential insolvency challenges as described under
"Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations."

If the Issuer issues Additional Notes with the same securities identification numbers as the Notes offered hereby,
a receiver, insolvency administrator or similar person may seek to challenge the enforceability of the Guarantees
securing both the Additional Notes and the initial Notes even if the hardening period with respect to the Guarantees
securing the initial Notes has expired, based on the fact that the initial Notes and the Additional Notes are fungible
and not distinguishable. Any such successful challenge would further reduce the proceeds available to the holders
of the Notes.

Moreover, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, including Italy, claims of certain categories of creditors
(creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to
the claims of other creditors. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees.”_

**_Corporate benefit and financial assistance laws and other limitations on the obligations under the Guarantees_**
**_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees._**

The Guarantees for the Notes provide the holders of the Notes with a right of recourse against the assets of the
relevant Guarantors. Each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates
to that Guarantor, unlawful, voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, i.e., to the extent that the grant
or the enforcement of the Guarantee, would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws
or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene its duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to
contravene any legal prohibition. Enforcement of the obligations under the Notes against the Issuer and
enforcement of a guarantee against a Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, or, in some cases, to limitations designed to ensure full compliance with
statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, voidable preference, unfair consideration, corporate
benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more
of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Issuer or a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability
under the Notes or its Guarantee or the Guarantees may be unenforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor

52


-----

of a Guarantor or the bankruptcy trustee, in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and
enforceability of the Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited
or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is no longer valid or enforceable, in whole or in part, the Notes would
effectively be subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such
Guarantor. See "Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations."

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a "change of control" in relation to the Issuer.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer is required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding
Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any. If a change of control were to occur, we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to pay
the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with similar provisions.

In addition, our other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to certain
events or transactions that could constitute a "change of control" under the terms of the Indenture, the Existing
Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The inability to purchase the Notes, the Existing
Notes or repay the Revolving Credit Facility upon the occurrence of a change of control would constitute an event
of default under the terms and conditions governing the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, which would trigger a cross-default under the Notes and vice versa. See "Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control."_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. In addition, the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and Wales,
the United States, the jurisdiction of incorporation or the center of main interest of a Guarantor or in more than
one such jurisdiction. Any multi-jurisdictional proceeding is likely to be complex and costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under
the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws, and there
can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany, and
Malaysia may be materially different from, or be in conflict with those of the United States and other jurisdictions
with which you may be familiar, including in the areas of the rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings. The application of
these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should
apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in the relevant
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of incorporation of certain Guarantors may limit the ability of those Guarantors to guarantee debt of
other companies. As a result, a court in those jurisdictions may deem the Guarantees to be invalid or reduce the
amount of guaranteed obligations available to satisfy claims under the Notes. See "Certain Insolvency and
_Enforceability Considerations."_

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. It is anticipated that some or all of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will be non-residents of the United States
and that some or all of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or its or their
respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon
civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. As a result, service of process within the United States upon

53


-----

the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their directors and executive officers, or enforcement against them,
judgements of U.S. courts would be possible only under certain conditions. In addition, neither the Issuer nor the
Guarantors assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be
enforceable in any of the above mentioned jurisdictions, other than the United States of America. There is also
doubt that a court in any of the above mentioned foreign jurisdictions would have the requisite power or authority
to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such foreign jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities
laws violations. See "Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments."

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as_**
**_those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
England and Wales, Italy, the United States, Germany and Malaysia. The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are
familiar. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and
those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors,
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuer, the Guarantors (or any other future Guarantors which may be required to grant a Guarantee under the
Indenture) or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of
analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). In particular, the Indenture could be limited in
scope and effect by the relevant courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under the
applicable case law, including Italian law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of the laws
of such jurisdictions. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could adversely affect your ability
to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may
receive. As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes and the Guarantees (and any other future
Guarantees which may be required to be granted under the Indenture) in an insolvency situation may be delayed
and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations” with respect
to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks
related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors
that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions._**

The Issuer has not agreed to register and does not intend to register the Notes under the Securities Act or any
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not offer
to sell the Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United
States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the
future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes under any other
country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion in the section entitled
"Notice to Investors" for further information about these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors

54


-----

in the Notes to ensure that their subscription for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with
any applicable securities laws.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if our creditworthiness worsens._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives us to be less likely to fully perform all obligations
under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the materialization of any of the
risks listed in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section. Even if our ability to fully perform all obligations under the Notes
when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception.
In addition, market participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors
operating in the same business as us could adversely change, causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If any
of these events occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the
materialization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could decrease.

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able_**
**_to sell them._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the Notes
to be admitted to the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, but cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of the holders of the Notes to sell such Notes or the price at which they may be
able to sell such Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Notes depend on many factors, including, among
other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar securities and general economic
conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing
the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do so. Any market-making that is commenced may be halted at
any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our financial
performance in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading market in the
Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Notes. As a result, we cannot ensure that an active
trading market will actually develop for the Notes.

Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject to similar
disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of our financial
performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes. In addition, the Indenture
will allow us to issue Additional Notes in the future, which could adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes.

**_The Notes may not remain listed on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM._**

Although we intend to maintain the listing of the Notes on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, as long as the
Notes are outstanding, we cannot assure prospective investors that the Notes will remain listed. If we cannot
maintain the listing of the Notes on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain
such listing, we may cease to maintain such listing on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM, provided that we will
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing of the Notes on another "recognised stock exchange"
(within the meaning of Section 1005 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007), although there can be no assurance that
the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing
on the London Stock Exchange’s ISM or a recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with
the Indenture, the delisting of the Notes from the London Stock Exchange’s ISM or another stock exchange in
accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the
secondary market.

**_Prospective investors may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If prospective investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange related risks due
to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro, relative to the currency by reference
to which such prospective investors measure their returns because of economic, political or other factors over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro, against the currency by reference to which prospective
investors measure their respective investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return of the Notes is translated

55


-----

into the currency by reference to which such investors measure their investment returns. There may be tax
consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in
the Notes. See "Tax Considerations."

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form, or the Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book-entry
interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or
holders of the Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole
registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the New Notes will be made to the paying agent, which
will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the New Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the
Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners
of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on
the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of
a noteholder under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon
the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from noteholders. Instead, if an investor
owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do
so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be
sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an "Event of Default" under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted
to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and
Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the New Notes. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form.”_

**_There may be risks related to payments made by an Italian resident guarantor._**

There is no authority directly regarding the Italian tax regime of payments on notes made by an Italian resident
guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative
treatment of such payments than that set forth herein.

With respect to payments on the Notes made to Italian resident noteholders by an Italian resident guarantor, in
accordance with one interpretation of Italian tax law, any such payments may be subject to Italian withholding
tax at the rate of 26% levied as a final tax or a provisional tax ("a titolo d’imposta" or "a titolo di acconto")
depending on the "status" of the noteholder, pursuant to Presidential Decree 29 September 1973, No. 600, as
subsequently amended. In the case of payments to non-Italian resident noteholders, the withholding tax should be
final. Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may apply allowing for a lower (or, in certain cases, nil) rate
of withholding tax in case of payments to non-Italian residents, subject to compliance with relevant subjective
and procedural requirements.

In accordance with another interpretation, any such payment made by the Italian resident guarantor should be
treated, in certain circumstances, as a payment by the relevant Issuer.

**_The independent auditors reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP included in this Offering Memorandum_**
**_include statements purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such report and the opinions contained_**
**_therein._**

In accordance with guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, each of the
independent auditors reports included in this Offering Memorandum of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP states:
“This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.”
Prospective investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditors
confirmed that they do not accept or assume any responsibility to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes)
other than to Synthomer’s members as a body with respect to their reports and to the independent auditors audit
work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement
or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act or in a report
filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language,
the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on its report or the
consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering to be €350,000,000 (assuming the Notes are issued at par).

On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i)
repurchase or redeem certain of the Existing Notes and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the
Offering.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds relating to the Offering. Actual amounts
are subject to adjustment and may differ significantly from estimated amounts, depending on several factors,
including the amount of accrued interest, fluctuations in the exchange rates among the euro and the pound sterling
and the amount of Existing Notes repurchased.

**(£ in**

**Sources** **millions)** **Uses** **(£ in millions)**

Notes offered hereby[(1)] ............................. 303.5 Repurchase of Existing Notes[(3)] ............ 320.8
Cash on balance sheet[(2)] ............................ 23.3 Estimated fees and expenses[(4)] .............. 6.0

**Total Sources ..........................................** **326.8** **Total Uses.............................................** **326.8**

(1) We have assumed that the Notes will be issued at par. Represents the pound sterling equivalent aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated Notes offered hereby, converted into pound sterling using the pound per euro exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00
= £0.8671. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576 were to be used, the principal amount of the Notes
would be approximately £300.1 million.

(2) Represents cash on balance sheet expected to be used in connection with the repurchase or redemption of the Existing Notes.

(3) Represents the estimated cash consideration to be used in connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes at par assuming that
principal amount equal to the Maximum Tender Amount of €370.0 million is tendered and accepted for purchase, excluding any accrued
interest. In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted for purchase is less than the Maximum
Acceptance Amount, the Issuer intends to redeem a portion of the Existing Notes equal to the difference between such tendered amount
and the Maximum Acceptance Amount. The Issuer intends to effect such redemption at par following July 1, 2024. The principal amount
of Existing Notes to be repurchased has been converted into pound sterling using the pound per euro exchange rate on December 31,
2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576 were to be used, the amount would be
approximately £317.3 million.

(4) Represents our estimate of the fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with or otherwise related to the Offering and the Tender
Offer, including financing fees, professional and legal fees, financial advisory fees and other transaction costs but excluding accrued but
unpaid interest in respect of the Existing Notes repurchased in connection with the Tender Offer or redemption. Actual fees and related
expenses may differ from these estimates. This amount does not give effect to any capitalization of debt issuance costs.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our consolidated capitalization, along with our consolidated cash and cash
equivalents, as of December 31, 2023, (i) on a historical basis, which is derived from our 2023 Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum; and (ii) on an as adjusted basis to give
effect to the Transactions.

This table is subject to the various assumptions regarding amounts as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

This table should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Data,” “Use of Proceeds,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Description of the
_Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,” as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements_
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(1) Represents cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.

(2) Represents the pound sterling equivalent aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated Notes offered hereby, converted into pound
sterling using the pound per euro exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671, and excludes associated capitalized debt
issuance costs. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576 were to be used, the principal amount of the Notes
would be approximately £300.1 million. Assumes that the Notes will be issued at par.

(3) Represents the estimated cash consideration to be used in connection with the repurchase of the Existing Notes at par assuming that
principal amount equal to the Maximum Tender Amount of €370.0 million is tendered and accepted for purchase. This adjustment
excludes the impact associated with the write off of capitalized debt issuance costs that would be required in connection with the
repurchase or redemption of the Existing Notes. In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered and accepted
for purchase is less than the Maximum Acceptance Amount, the Issuer intends to redeem a portion of the Existing Notes equal to the
difference between such tendered amount and the Maximum Acceptance Amount. The Issuer intends to effect such redemption at par
following July 1, 2024. The principal amount of Existing Notes to be repurchased has been converted into pound sterling using the pound
per euro exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671. If a pound per euro exchange rate on April 3, 2024 of €1.00 = £0.8576
were to be used, the amount would be to approximately £317.3 million.

(4) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have €300 million in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, which
remains undrawn.

(5) Represents euro term facilities in an aggregate amount of €287.5 million (the “Euro **UKEF Facilities”) and unsecured dollar term loan**
facilities in an aggregate amount of $230 million (the “Dollar **UKEF Facilities” and, together with Euro UKEF Facilities, the “UKEF**
**Facilities”). As of December 31, 2023, the UKEF Facilities were fully drawn. Using the euro per pound exchange rate on December 31,**
2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671 and the US dollar per pound exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of $1.00 = £0.7854. Pursuant to the terms of
the UKEF Facilities, UK Export Finance has provided a partial guarantee of up to 80% of the UKEF Facilities.

(6) Represents bank overdrafts as of December 31, 2023.

(7) Includes current lease liabilities of £13.8 million and non-current lease liabilities of £41.5 million.

(8) Total equity does not include any impact on retained earnings related to the repurchase or redemption of the Existing Notes.

(9) Total capitalization comprises total borrowings (including lease liabilities) plus total equity.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to convey_
_management’s perspective on our operating performance and financial condition during the periods under_
_review._

_This disclosure is intended to assist readers in understanding and interpreting our consolidated financial_
_information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The discussion should be read in conjunction with_
_the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Data” and “Selected Financial Information.” We are required to comply with IFRS, and our accounting_
_policies have been established accordingly._

_The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on_
_our current projections and expectations which we consider reasonable about future events. Our actual results_
_may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many important_
_factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section in this Offering Memorandum. See “Cautionary Note_
_Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_This section includes certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS_
_because we believe they provide investors with useful additional information to measure our performance,_
_liquidity or capital expenditures. These non-IFRS financial measures have important limitations as analytical_
_tools. We believe that these non-IFRS measures are a useful indicator of our ongoing performance and our ability_
_to service our indebtedness and can assist certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties in_
_evaluating us. You should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS measures as reported by us to non-IFRS_
_measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not_
_consider them in isolation. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

_Unless otherwise indicated or implied by the context, references in this section to “we,” “our,” “us,”_
_“Synthomer,” the “Company” and the “Group” are to Synthomer plc together with its subsidiaries on a_
_consolidated basis. Certain figures contained in this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of_
_operations, including financial information, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain_
_instances, (i) the sum or percentage change of the numbers may not conform exactly with the total figure given;_
_and (ii) the sum of the numbers in a column or row in certain tables may not conform exactly with the total figure_

**OVERVIEW**

We are a high-performance, highly specialized polymers and ingredients company with strong geographic
diversity and product differentiation focused on a wide range of markets through our three end-customer facing
divisions: coatings and construction; adhesives; and health and protection. Speciality chemicals are value-add
products manufactured using polymerization and other reactive processes to transform commodity raw materials
into polymers and other complex chemical outputs that are used by customers in a variety of downstream

underlying operating profit of £20.6 million from continuing operations.

As of December 31, 2023, we served over 6,000 customers through our three divisions, currently supported by
the operation of 36 manufacturing sites (with another announced closure underway) in 17 countries, including
four innovation Centers of Excellence that form part of the broader network of 12 technical centers, and
approximately 4,200 employees globally.

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DISCUSSED**

The following discussion is based on (i) the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (including the comparative
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022); and (ii) the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements
(including the comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021), each included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. Following the completion of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business, the
2022 Consolidated Financial Statements consolidated the financial information of the Adhesive Resins Business
from April 1, 2022, and the Adhesive Resins Business is consolidated into the financial information of the Group
for the full year ended December 31, 2023. On December 31, 2022, we announced that we had entered into an
agreement to sell our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses to Surteco North America, Inc and the
Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses, as of February 28, 2023, is no longer consolidated into the
financial information. On September 29, 2023, we announced our intention to shut down our North America Paper
and Carpet Business before the end of 2023, which triggered the classification of the North America Paper and

61


-----

Carpet Business as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements
(including the 2022 comparative financial information presented therein) under IFRS 5.

As a result of the foregoing acquisitions and disposals, our results of operations may not be directly comparable
with prior or subsequent periods. The following discussion and analysis do not otherwise present the historical
financial condition, changes in historical financial condition and historical results of operations for the Adhesive
Resins Business. The discussion below is primarily based on our “Underlying performance,” which represents the
statutory performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding the effects of Special Items.

The definition of Special Items has been consistently applied across the periods presented in this Offering
Memorandum. Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in the assessment of the business’
performance would lead to a distortion of trends or are technical adjustments which ensure our consolidated
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of the business in
the year, or both. The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special Items in order to provide a more
clear indication of our Underlying performance:

- restructuring and site closure costs;

- sale of a business or significant asset;

- acquisition costs;

- amortisation of acquired intangible assets;

- impairment of non-current assets;

- fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments where hedge accounting is not
applied;

- items of income and expense that are considered material, either by their size and/or nature;

- tax impact of above items; and

- settlement of prior period tax issues.

We believe that presenting “Underlying performance” as an alternative performance measure provides additional
clarity for our investors and stakeholders on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses and it is the
primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Caution should be exercised in the comparison of the non-IFRS
measures as reported to non-IFRS measures of other companies. Non-IFRS measures have limitations as an
analytical tool, and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Group’s
operating results as reported under IFRS.

**PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

Our operating and financial results are affected by a number of factors. These factors have materially influenced
our financial condition and results of operations during the periods under review and are expected to influence
our future financial condition and results of operations. These factors are not exhaustive, and the entirety of this
Offering Memorandum should be reviewed, particularly the “Risk Factors” section.

**_General economic and geopolitical conditions and demand in our end markets_**

The chemicals industry generally and, to a lesser extent, the speciality chemicals segment in which we operate, is
impacted by general economic conditions. Historically, demand has been generally correlated to GDP growth, or
growth at a rate higher than GDP, in our markets both regionally and globally. In particular, the volatility of raw
material prices is driven by the volatility in oil prices, which have been and may continue to be affected by
geopolitical events, with higher oil prices generally leading to higher costs of energy and raw materials, although
some raw materials are impacted less than others.

62


-----

We produce a diverse array of product types—NBR, SBR, polymer modifiers, acrylic and vinyl acrylic
dispersions, tackifying resins, additives and amorphous polyolefins for adhesive products, acrylate monomers and
specialities. Our products have applications in a variety of end markets, including coatings, construction, fiber
bonding, energy, speciality additives, tires, hygiene, packaging, tapes and labels, gloves, speciality paper coatings,
polymer additives, inorganic additives, and acrylate monomers. While the level of demand for each of our product
types and in each of our end markets is affected by factors specific to that product type and that particular end
market, certain overarching global trends have an impact across our product types and end markets. These include
demographic changes such as population growth, ageing populations and urbanization as well as the impact of an
increasing global focus on energy reduction and more sustainable products. Demand for our customers’ end
products is also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as the correlation between demand for construction
products and infrastructure spending with economic conditions. The fluctuations in demand for our customers’
end products in turn affects the demand for our products. For example, in 2021, with the COVID-19 pandemic
driving increased demand for medical gloves, our NBR plants ran at maximum capacity, with certain plants hitting
record capacity driving increased revenue and EBITDA growth across the business. Conversely, 2022 and 2023
were challenging years for our NBR business, as high levels of existing inventory of medical gloves and reduced
demand created a prolonged period of destocking and, in turn substantially depressed demand for our NBR
products. In the absence of growth, our NBR plants ran at lower than anticipated utilization rates during the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 and overcapacity remains in the market.

Demand for our products also varies in the geographic regions that we serve. Historically, demand in Europe and
North America has been driven by changes in demographics, customer requirements for high-quality products
and stringent health and safety regulations. Demand in developing regions has been driven by demographic factors
such as population growth (in particular, through a growing middle class), ongoing industrialization and
urbanization as well as infrastructure spending.

**_Raw material and energy prices and product pricing_**

Raw material and energy prices can be volatile and comprise the largest portion of our costs of goods sold,
contributing approximately 89% of variable costs for the year ended December 31, 2023. The nature of our
markets, as well as our market positions and differentiated product offerings, allow us to manage the majority of
our exposure to raw material price fluctuations by generally passing through increases in the prices of raw
materials to our customers. For example, while the after-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine and attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have disrupted supply chains globally, including within our
industry, we have generally been able to pass through most of these costs, particularly in our speciality business.

Key raw materials are based on petrochemical feedstocks, predominantly butadiene, styrene, butyl acrylate,
methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile. Many suppliers operate globally, with some focusing on a regional
approach. Prices of the majority of raw materials (by cost) are in part dependent on crude oil prices but are also
influenced by supply and demand of each product and the associated cost of transporting each product. Supply
contracts are normally entered into on an annual basis, with price adjustments on a monthly or quarterly basis.
We buy raw materials either under these supplier contracts or via the spot market, depending on which is more
favorable.

Substantially all of our customer agreements have no pricing commitment beyond one month, with approximately
one third of such agreements being formulaic with the remainder being generally negotiable on a monthly basis.
As a result, we are generally able to modify the pricing of our products in line with increases in the prices of raw
materials, resulting in corresponding increases in selling prices although there is typically a one-month to threemonth time lag in our ability to do so.

While we sometimes enter into forward contracts or derivative agreements to hedge the risk of fluctuations in
energy prices, we do not use commodity derivatives to hedge the risk of fluctuations in raw materials prices and
instead rely on our ability to reflect raw material price volatility in our pricing. However, from time-to-time we
enter into swaps for our raw materials and sell our purchased raw materials to other buyers in order to manage our
quantities of raw materials.

**_Acquisitions and disposals_**

Our strategy has historically involved opportunistic “bolt-on” acquisitions in businesses operating in similar
chemistries and market segments, as well as transformational step change transactions. We have focused the
expansion of our business through the acquisition of complementary “bolt-on” speciality chemicals businesses or
production assets that offer product portfolios based on similar chemical reactions, processes or supply chains. In
these situations, we aim to leverage our expertise and existing technical knowledge, as the product offerings of
these acquired companies may involve similar raw materials to those we use, involve similar types of chemical
process (such as polymerization of monomer chains) or use processes which result in similar kinds of products to
those we already produce. In addition, we have in the past, pursued acquisitions to expand into new geographies,
acquire new technologies, strengthen our supply chains and consolidate our market position in existing geographic
and end markets.

From time to time, we have also opportunistically considered investments in larger speciality chemicals
companies. However, the delivery of such potential acquisitions is subject to such acquisitions enhancing our
overall value and aligning with our strategic and financial objectives.

In October 2021, we announced the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business, which develops, manufactures
and sells tackifying resins and additives for adhesive products, with a strong focus on attractive end markets such
as hygiene, packaging and high-performance tire additives. The acquisition was completed on April 1, 2022, for
a total consideration of £779.1 million, allowing us to build on our significant portfolio and geographic growth
alongside the diversification of our portfolio, end-markets and geographies through a complementary business
offering. Following completion of the acquisition, the Adhesive Resins Business became our new Adhesive
Technologies division, which delivered revenues of £391.3 million and EBITDA of £39.5 million during the nine
month period following acquisition on April 1, 2022. On January 1, 2023, following our divisional reorganization,
the Adhesive Technologies division was integrated into our newly formed Adhesive Solutions division. Trading
in the first two quarters of ownership of the Adhesive Resins Business was in line with management’s
expectations. However, in the fourth quarter of 2022, volume and EBITDA deteriorated due to a number of
macroeconomic and company-specific factors, contributing to a non-cash impairment of the acquisition goodwill.
See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business and industry— _Potential future impairments of intangible assets_
_could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.”_

We also evaluate the performance of our existing businesses on a continuing basis and, during the period under
review, have divested certain businesses and assets in order to streamline the business. As part of our “Focus,
Strengthen and Grow” strategy announced in October 2022, we announced an intent to rationalize our portfolio
through the divestment of non-core businesses. During our strategic review, a number of non-core businesses
were identified that have limited synergies with the rest of our identified growth platforms and which we believe
are less attractive areas to deploy capital. As a result, on December 13, 2022, we agreed to sell our Laminates,
Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses to Surteco North America, Inc., and completed the sale on February 28,
2023, raising total net proceeds of $269 million (including $262 million (£218.5 million) of cash consideration
after transaction costs received at completion and utilized to repay existing debt, a further $5 million receivable
in cash on the 13-month anniversary of completion and other working capital settlement-related receivable and
remaining transaction costs payable). On September 29, 2023, we announced our intention to shut down our North
America Paper and Carpet Business before the end of 2023, as part of our previously announced strategy to exit
a number of non-core businesses, including the paper and carpet businesses globally. In addition, we are formally
exploring additional divestment processes for our non-core businesses in Europe, currently incorporated within
the Health & Protection and Performance Materials division. There is no assurance that any such divestment
process will conclude.

**_Investments_**

Investing in innovation, R&D and operational excellence is important to succeed in the speciality chemicals
industry. As customers’ needs evolve and the competitive outlook and regulatory environment changes, it is
important to remain agile and to adapt in order to meet market demands. We recognize the importance of
innovation to our success and to that of our customers and we have an impressive track record and pipeline of
new product development through customer-focused R&D. Over the past three fiscal years, we have maintained
our sales volume derived from products launched in the previous five years at or above our target levels, deriving

64


-----

24%, 20% and 22% of our sales volume from products that were launched in the previous five years in 2021, 2022
and 2023 respectively. The decrease in 2022 compared to prior periods was primarily due to the ongoing effects
of COVID-19, which slowed the commercialization of some new products in early 2022, although we saw
increased momentum in the second half of the year as more customers were able to test and validate our new
products. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2023, we introduced 14 new products and since 2020, we
have filed patent applications on 30 new inventions.

With regard to innovation and R&D, we maintain a network of 12 innovation sites around the world, including
four centers of innovation excellence in the U.K., Malaysia, Germany and the United States, along with a fifth
which we have announced will be established in Shanghai, China. Our commitment to R&D and product
development has been maintained, despite our announced cash saving measures and a challenging macroeconomic
backdrop, with research and development expenditures during the period increasing to £34.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, from £33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and £28.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021.

We have also made a number of investments in our manufacturing capabilities to raise production capacity,
streamline operations, drive cost efficiency, enhance SHE processes and improve sustainable practices. In 2023
we introduced a new sustainability pillar into our Manufacturing Excellence program, with the aim of helping
each site develop – and act on – decarbonization and resource use roadmaps, with energy efficiency as an
immediate focus, while in 2022, we completed our JOB6 NBR capacity expansion project in Pasir Gudang
(Malaysia), commissioned in 2020, and delivered additional production capacity through debottlenecking projects
and operational efficiency initiatives, including the successful debottlenecking project at our Stallingborough
(UK) site. In August 2023, we took the decision to mothball our NBR facility in Kluang, Malaysia, which is
expected to reduce our NBR production capacity by approximately 20% and support better utilization levels across
the Group.

Discipline in capital allocation remains a key focus of ours, with hurdle rates for capital expenditure growth
projects requiring an internal rate of return higher than the cost of capital. In May 2022, we launched a working
capital and capital expenditure review across our business, which was further accelerated and extended in
September 2022. Following the review, we announced cash saving targets and a focus on disciplined capital
allocation, including the allocation of approximately 75% of capital being deployed to our Coatings &
Construction Solutions and Adhesive Solutions divisions over the medium term, with the remaining 25% to Health
& Protection and Performance Materials.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations_**

_Translation Effect_

Our reporting and functional currency is the pound sterling, while we generate sales, incur costs and have assets
and liabilities at our various subsidiaries in other currencies, particularly the euro, US dollar and Malaysian ringgit.
Therefore, a weakening of the pound sterling against the euro, US dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result in an
increase in our revenues and costs as reported in pound sterling and, conversely, a strengthening of the pound
sterling against the euro, US dollar or Malaysian ringgit will result in a decrease in our revenues and costs as
reported in pound sterling. As many of our operations are in markets other than the U.K., these effects may be
significant. Profit translation exposures from overseas operations are not hedged.

The balance sheets of our overseas subsidiaries may include monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the subsidiary’s reporting currency, which exposes the subsidiaries, and accordingly the
Group, to another type of translation effect. In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies,
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the transaction dates. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in
a foreign currency are not retranslated.

The table below illustrates the effect on the Group’s consolidated income statement and items for each of the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 which are recognized directly in equity that would result from reasonably

possible movements in euro, US dollar and Malaysian ringgit to pound sterling exchange rates, before the effect
of tax.

_Transactional effects_

Due to the international nature of our operations, we frequently conduct transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency of the Group. Transactions in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency are
recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions and as a result, we may have an exposure
to transactional risks. Our policy is, where practicable, to hedge exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. In
regard to transactions with suppliers and customers in currencies other than the pound sterling, our policy is to
hedge significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at the operating company level using forward foreign
exchange contracts.

_Indebtedness_

The majority of our outstanding indebtedness is denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, serving as
a hedge against our assets denominated in those currencies. The amount of reported indebtedness is therefore
subject to currency-related fluctuations when translated into pound sterling for inclusion in our financial
statements at period-end exchange rates. Therefore, a weakening of the pound sterling against the euro or US
dollar, for example, will result in an increase in the pound sterling value of our euro or US dollar-denominated
indebtedness while a strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro and the US dollar will result in a decrease
in the pound sterling value of respective euro or US dollar-denominated indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2023, our borrowings were primarily denominated in euro and US dollars, with total
borrowings denominated in euro amounting to the pound sterling equivalent of £700.8 million and borrowings
denominated in US dollars amounting to the pound sterling equivalent of £180.7 million.

**_Environmental Considerations_**

Our results of operations are subject to extensive and continuously evolving environmental laws and regulations.
These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and
disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges and air emissions including greenhouse
gases. We have invested, and will continue to invest, financial and technical resources in order to achieve and
maintain compliance with environmental requirements. Environmental considerations can also impact the markets
in which we operate, including our position with respect to other competitors.

The main regulations relating to the safe use of substances and chemicals affecting our industry are the REACH
regulation in the European Union, UK REACH in the UK and the TSCA in the United States, which impose
significant obligations on the chemicals industry with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and
registration of substances. The obligations imposed by these and other regulations are expensive and timeconsuming and lead to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. In
addition, costs may be incurred in connection with the restoration and decommissioning of former manufacturing
sites. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Compliance with safety, health and environment
_(“SHE”) laws and regulations and the retention of requisite permits related to our facilities and operations could_
_result in significant ongoing costs and may result in further obligations and liabilities associated with our_
_business.”_

-----

Our product line consists of a wide range of speciality polymers which are used as the base component or as a
performance enhancing ingredient in materials such as coatings, adhesives, construction materials, rubber, and
plastics. The majority of these products are water-based systems which are produced and used without the need
for volatile organic solvents. For example, we produce the polymers which are the base material in water-based
paints which replace less sustainable solvent-based coatings. The balance of our product portfolio consists of
resins and polymers which are “100% active” in use, meaning they are used in applications such as hot melt
adhesive without the need for solvents or water carriers. In all, our products enable the elimination of the use of
solvents, thus eliminating emissions of volatile organic compound (“VOCs”) to the environment, some of which
can have harmful effects on human health and the environment.

**_Product and end market mix_**

We produce and sell a wide range of speciality chemical products in different geographic regions and for a variety
of end markets.

The products we offer have applications in a range of end markets. As of January 1, 2023, we reorganized our
divisional structure along three new, market-focused divisions, to better serve our end-market customers,
comprised of (i) Coatings & Construction Solutions (with end-markets uses including architectural and masonry
coatings, mortar modification, waterproofing and flooring, fiber bonding and energy solutions), (ii) Adhesive
Solutions (with end-markets uses including tapes and labels, packaging, hygiene, tires and plastic modification)
and (iii) Health & Protection and Performance Materials (with end-markets uses including medical glove
manufacturing, speciality paper, food packaging, carpet and artificial turf, gel foam elastomers and vinyl-coated
seating fabrics).

Overall, we believe that our product mix is well-balanced, with 41.4% 29.5% and 29.1% of our worldwide
revenues from continuing operations (excluding intersegmental revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2023
generated from sales of Coatings & Construction Solutions, Adhesive Solutions and Health & Protection and
Performance Materials, respectively.

The composition of our sales to each end market is affected by market dynamics, whether due to long-term end
market trends, such as expected future growth in the Nitrile disposable glove market, evolving customer needs or
due to competitive pressure such as shorter-term customer stocking and destocking. The demands for our products
in the end markets we serve are also affected by overarching factors such as demographic changes – including
population growth, urbanization and an ageing population, as well as the impact of an increasing global focus on
energy reduction and more sustainable products.

Overall, while we believe our product mix is well-balanced, over the medium-term, our goal is to further rebalance
our geographic distribution through increased weighting of revenues in the United States and Asia, and a stronger
weighting of higher-margin speciality products relative to base products.

To maintain an appropriate product mix for each market, we continue to monitor and respond to industry trends
and market developments, in order to tailor our R&D processes to develop innovative products and solutions that
anticipate market and customer needs, and to acquire and integrate companies that complement our existing
product mix.

**_Seasonality_**

Our operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in demand as customers in many of the end markets we serve
slow down operations during certain months of the year. These fluctuations affect both our sales volumes and the
prices of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing processes. Generally, and absent the impact of major
demand recovery, supply shocks or cost reduction programs, we expect approximately 55% of underlying
operating profit to be generated in the first half of each calendar year, and approximately 45% of underlying
operating profit to be generated in the second half of each calendar year due to the slowdown around the summer
holidays in July and August and the Christmas holidays in December. Changes in demand based on seasonal
fluctuations can also affect our working capital requirements. We continually monitor seasonal changes in demand
in order to mitigate possible effects on our business.

**FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

As a result of certain events, such as adoption of material new accounting standards and amendments or major
acquisitions and disposals, year-on-year comparisons of financial results may not be fully comparable. Our
revenue, operating profit and other financial results may be affected by such factors as changes in accounting
standards or changes in the scope of our business between financial periods.

**_Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions_**

We consummated the following acquisitions and dispositions:

2023

On September 29, 2023, we announced our intention to shut down our North America Paper and Carpet Business
before the end of 2023, as part of our previously announced strategy to exit a number of non-core businesses,
including the paper and carpet businesses globally. This triggered the classification of the North America Paper
and Carpet Business as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in the 2023 Consolidated Financial
Statements (including the 2022 comparative financial information presented therein) as the approved plan and
announcement to divest the North America Paper and Carpet Business represented a major line of business
discontinuation under IFRS 5. See Note 30 (Discontinued operations) to the 2023 Consolidated Financial
Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, the results of operations as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2021 may not be directly comparable with subsequent periods.

On December 13, 2022, we announced an agreement to divest our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Business
to Surteco North America, Inc. and completed the disposal on February 28, 2023. The final net cash proceeds
received at completion amounted to $262 million and were used to repay existing debt, together with a further $5
million receivable in cash on the 13-month anniversary of completion and other working capital settlement related
receivable and remaining transaction costs payable amounting to a total net proceeds of $269.0 million. This
triggered the classification of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses as discontinued operations and
assets held for sale in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements (including the 2021 comparative financial
information presented therein) as the approved plan and announcement to divest the Laminates, Films and Coated
Fabrics Businesses represented a major line of business discontinuation under IFRS 5. See Note 31 (Discontinued
_operations) to the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 30 (Discontinued operations) to the 2023_
Consolidated Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

2022

In October 2021, we announced the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business, which developed, manufactured
and sold tackifying resins and additives for adhesive products, with a strong focus on attractive end markets such
as hygiene, packaging and high-performance tire additives. The acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business was
completed on April 1, 2022, for a total consideration of £779.1 million, allowing us to build on our significant
portfolio and geographic growth, while simultaneously diversifying our portfolio, end-markets and geographies
through a complementary business offering. The results of the Adhesive Resins Business have been consolidated
within the Group financial information from April 1, 2022, the completion date of the acquisition of the Adhesives
Resins Business. As a result, the operational and financial information presented as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 does not account for the full year trading impact of the Adhesive Resins Business. The results
of the Adhesive Resins Business are not consolidated in periods prior to April 1, 2022, and therefore the
operational and financial information presented as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 may not be
directly comparable with subsequent periods presented in this Offering Memorandum. See Note 30 (Acquisition)
to the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.

2021

On April 7, 2021, we disposed of 100% of our shareholding in Synthomer (Thailand) Limited to Rimrise FZE for
consideration of £2.9 million. The disposal did not have a material impact on the comparison of our financial
results for the periods under review.

operating profit of £22.5 million. Following completion of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins
Business, the Adhesive Resins Business became the new Adhesive Technologies division, which
delivered revenues of £391.3 million and EBITDA of £39.5 million during the nine-month period
following acquisition on April 1, 2022 and accordingly, the results for the year ended December 31, 2022
reflect nine months of trading and no comparative information is provided for the prior period. On
January 1, 2023, following our divisional reorganization, the Adhesive Technologies division was
integrated into the newly formed Adhesive Solutions division

A segmental analysis of IFRS measures, Underlying performance and Special Items is shown below for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, as derived from our 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (including the

**KEY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS**


The following is a description of certain line items as discussed in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”:_

**Revenue**

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived revenue from our three customer focused segments: Coatings
& Construction, Adhesive Solutions and Health & Protection and Performance Materials. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we derived revenue from our five global operating segments: Performance Elastomers,
Functional Solutions, Industrial Specialities, Acrylate Monomers and Adhesive Technologies. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, we derived revenue from four global operating segments: Performance Elastomers,
Functional Solutions, Industrial Specialities and Acrylate Monomers. We earn revenues from the sales of a variety
of products, including: NBR, SBR, elastomeric modifiers, aqueous dispersions, tackifying resins, acrylate
monomers and specialities.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in a contract with a customer
when performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control of the product
is transferred from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant asset in line with the international commercial terms
developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (“incoterms”) under which it is sold. The significant
majority of Synthomer’s products are sold under carriage paid to (“CPT”) and carriage and insurance paid
(“CIP”) incoterms. Under these terms, control of the product is transferred when the goods reach their destination.
At this point the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred and there is no unfulfilled obligation that
could affect the customer’s acceptance of the product.

**Cost of Sales**

Cost of sales includes raw materials and other fixed and variable production costs associated with producing the
products for sale. Fixed costs included in the cost of sales are the wages and salaries of plant workers, rent, repairs
and maintenance, while variable costs include the costs of raw materials, freight, utilities, packaging and
consumables.

71


-----

**Gross Profit**

Gross profit is calculated as revenue less the cost of sales.

**Sales and Marketing Costs**

Sales and marketing costs primarily relate to costs incurred in respect of sales personnel, including wages and
salaries and travel expenses, in addition to marketing, advertising and subscriptions to associated trade bodies.

**Administrative Expenses**

Administrative expenses typically include indirect wages and salaries associated with our employees, as well as
indirect overheads. Indirect overheads would include such items as R&D expenses, insurance costs, legal and
professional fees, office supplies, marketing and promotional expenditure and costs associated with a listed public
company.

**EBITDA**

EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation and amortisation and Special Items. A reconciliation
between EBITDA and IFRS operating profit from continuing operations is provided below:

**For the year ended**

**December 31,**

**2021** **2022**

**_Continuing operations_** **(represented)** **(represented)** **2023**

**£ millions**
**EBITDA ..........................................................................................** 498.0 253.8 142.1
Depreciation and amortisation - underlying performance ............... (65.2) (84.3) (104.4)
Special items .................................................................................... (136.3) (183.0) (73.1)

**Operating profit / (loss) - IFRS ....................................................** **296.5** **(13.5)** **(35.4)**

**Depreciation and amortisation**

Depreciation and amortisation includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the production, sales
or distribution of products, as well as amortisation of intangible assets.

**Underlying Operating Profit**

Underlying operating profit represents profit before finance costs, taxation, and Special Items.

**Finance Costs**

Finance Costs is calculated as interest payable on borrowings and overdrafts less interest receivable, the
amortisation of set-up costs for facilities, plus interest charges payable on pension liabilities which are recognized
and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, fair value of unhedged interest derivatives and
interest element of lease payables.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is
based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

72


-----

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities
are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilized.

**Underlying Performance**

The IFRS profit measures show our performance as a whole and as such includes all sources of income and
expenses, including both irregular items and those that do not relate to our ongoing businesses. To provide
additional clarity on the ongoing trading performance of our businesses, management uses “Underlying
performance” as an alternative performance measure to plan for, control and assess the performance of the
business. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS measures, as it excludes Special Items. For further
information regarding Underlying performance, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non_IFRS Financial Measures” and “Summary Financial and Other Information.”_

**RESULTS OF UNDERLYING OPERATIONS**

**Comparison of underlying performance for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023**

_Revenue – Continuing operations_

Revenue from continuing operations decreased by £361.4 million, or 15.5%, to £1,970.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, from £2,332.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to reduced
volumes, driven by subdued end-market demand and increased competition across some base chemicals, as well
as pass through of lower raw material input prices, partially offset by a full year of sales from the Adhesive Resins
Business.

Revenues from continuing operations from the Coatings & Construction Solutions segment decreased by £180.6.
million, or 18.1%, to £815.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £996.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to volume reductions, reflecting customer de-stocking, reduced demand
and pass through of lower raw material input prices.

Revenues from continuing operations from the Adhesive Solutions segment increased by £8.8 million, or 1.5%,
to £581.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £572.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, primarily due to the full year inclusion of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business, offsetting an underlying
volume decline, driven by lower demand and reliability and supply chain issues, and pass through of lower raw
material input prices.

Revenues from continuing operations from the Health & Protection and Performance Materials segment decreased
by £189.6 million, or 24.8%, to £573.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £763.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to volume reduction and significantly lower prices, particularly
within NBR, and the pass through of lower raw material input prices.

_Cost of Sales – Continuing operations_

Cost of sales from continuing operations decreased by £255.1 million, or 13.3%, to £1,663.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, from £1,918.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to reduced
volumes, offset by moderating raw materials prices.

_Gross Profit – Continuing operations_

Gross profit from continuing operations decreased by £106.3 million, or 25.7%, to £307.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, from £413.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower
pricing and volume decline, particularly within Adhesive Solutions and Health & Protection and Performance
Materials, offset by the move to a more speciality weighting within the product portfolio.

_Sales & Marketing Costs – Continuing operations_

Sales and marketing costs from continuing operations increased by £2.1 million, or 2.9%, to £74.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2023, from £72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the
full year inclusion of the acquired Adhesive Resins business and inflation, offset by operating cost reduction
programs.

_Administrative Expenses – Continuing operations_

Administrative expenses from continuing operations increased by £3.0 million, or 3.4%, to £92.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2023, from £89.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the
full year inclusion of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business and inflation, offset by operating cost reduction
programs.

_EBITDA – Continuing operations_

EBITDA from continuing operations decreased by £111.7 million, or 44.0%, to £142.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, from £253.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to volume and
pricing pressure, driven by lower levels of demand, mitigated by a strong focus on cost and the full year inclusion
of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business.

74


-----

EBITDA from continuing operations from the Coatings & Construction Solutions segment decreased by £20.7.
million, or 17.1%, to £100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £120.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to lower volumes, offset by improvements in margin, reflecting the
significant speciality weighting within the division.

EBITDA from continuing operations from the Adhesive Solutions segment decreased by £36.0 million, or 53.6%,
to £31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
primarily due to significant market challenges within base product offerings, offset by synergies and other cost
reduction programs, and the full year inclusion of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business.

EBITDA from continuing operations from the Health & Protection segment and Performance Materials decreased
by £55.5 million, or 64.2%, to £31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £86.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the negative impact of lower volumes within base chemicals
businesses, offset by cost initiatives which drove improved EBITDA margins in the second half of 2023.

_Depreciation and Amortisation – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying depreciation & amortisation from continuing operations increased by £20.1 million, or 23.8%, to
£104.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £84.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
primarily reflecting a full year of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business and a reprofiling of the depreciation rate
of those fixed assets under IAS 16.

_Operating Profit – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying operating profit from continuing operations decreased by £131.8 million, or 77.8%, to £37.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £169.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the
reduction in EBITDA and increase in depreciation and amortization from continuing operations for the reasons
noted above.

The table below outlines the Special Items for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 and provides
a reconciliation between IFRS operating profit and underlying performance of operating profit from continuing
operations for each the following years:

-----

_Operating Loss—IFRS – Continuing operations_

Operating loss from continuing operations increased by £21.9 million, or 162.2%, to a loss of £35.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023, from a loss of £13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating
loss attributable to Special Items decreased by £109.9 million, or 60.1%, to £73.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, from £183.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The amortisation of acquired intangibles relates to acquired customer relationships. Amortisation of acquired
intangibles increased by £4.5 million, to £49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from £44.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the full year inclusion of the acquired Adhesive Resins
Business. The fair value of the intangible assets arising on acquisitions are being amortized over a period of 5-20
years.

Impairment charge for the year December 31, 2023 related to a £5.6 million charge provided on the mothballing
of our NBR plant in Malaysia. Impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to a £133.7
million non-cash impairment charge was taken in the year, relating to the Adhesives Technologies division. This
reflected reliability and supply chain issues, which we have improved and are working to further resolve, and
lower-than-expected capacity acquired, reducing the forecast earnings from the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins
Business used for impairment testing.

Restructuring and site closure costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 comprised a £3.3 million charge in
relation to the ongoing integration of the acquired Adhesive Resins Business into the Adhesive Solutions division,
£3.8 million of costs in relation to the strategy change and alignment of the business into its new divisions effective
from 2023, £5.9 million of costs for ongoing functional and site rationalization in US and Europe, as a result of
divisional realignment and the sale of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics business and a £1.7 million charge
in relation to demolition and site rationalization activity in Malaysia. Restructuring and site closure costs for the
year ended December 31, 2022 comprised £9.6 million in charges related to the ongoing integration of the
Adhesive Resins Business, a £3.2 million charge in relation to site closure of one of the smaller sites in Malaysia
and a further £6.7 million, in relation to further demolition and site rationalization costs, as well as costs in relation
to our strategy change and alignment of our business into its new divisions effective in 2023.

Acquisition costs and related gains for the year ended December 31, 2023 include £2.0 million of costs for the
acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business, related to obligations to the US pension schemes. Acquisition costs
and related gains for the year ended December 31, 2022 include £6.5 million of costs related to the acquisition of
the Adhesives Resins Business, which primarily consist of professional adviser fees, and are offset by a £5.4
million gain on a foreign exchange derivative entered into in October 2021 to hedge the acquisition price.

Loss on the sale of business for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the proceeds net of costs, primarily
professional fees, incurred in conjunction with the sale of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics business to
Surteco.

Regulatory fine relates to the impact of the European Commission’s investigation initiated in 2018 into styrene
monomer purchasing practices of a number of companies, including Synthomer, operating in the European
Economic Area. We fully cooperated with the Commission throughout the investigation. In 2022, the European
Commission concluded its investigation, resulting in a fine of 38.5 million. We had a related provision of €43
million (£38 million as of December 31, 2022 and £38.4 million as of December 31, 2023), with the final amount
being €44.3 million, paid in January 2024.

_Finance Costs – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying finance costs from continuing operations increased by £19.1 million, or 41.7%, to £64.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023, from £45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to
increases in base borrowing rates for our main currencies, plus the full the full year impact of the acquisition of
the Adhesive Resins Business in April 2022, offset by the benefit of the divestment of our Laminates, Films and
Coated Fabrics business in February 2023 and the impact of equity securities issued in October 2023.

_Profit/(Loss) Before Tax – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

As a result of the foregoing, underlying profit/(loss) before tax from continuing operations decreased by £150.9
million, to a loss of £27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from a profit of £123.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022.

_Taxation – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying taxation from continuing operations decreased by £29.1 million, to a net benefit of £1.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023, from taxation of £27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
effective tax rate on Underlying performance decreased to 6% for the year ended December 31, 2023, from 22%
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Comparison of underlying performance for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022**

Our consolidated results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 (represented) and 2022 are
reported in the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements (including the comparative financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2021 as presented therein) which are prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial
_Information for Synthomer” and “Selected Financial Information.”_

11.2%, to £1,001.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £900.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, primarily due to the significant increase in raw material costs, which were passed on to
customers. This was partially offset by lower volumes, particularly in the coatings business.

Revenues from the continuing operations from the Industrial Specialities segment increased by £36.7 million, or
18.6%, to £233.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £197.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved profitability and strong mix across its high-margin businesses.

Revenues from the continuing operations from the Acrylate Monomers segment (excluding inter-segmental
revenue) increased by £2.5 million, or 2.6%, to £97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £95.2
million for the year ended, December 31, 2021, primarily due to better product mix and the pass-through of higher
raw material prices, partially offset by lower volumes.

Adhesive Technologies was a newly formed division for the year ended December 31, 2022, with no reported
revenues in the prior period.

_Cost of Sales – Continuing operations_

Cost of sales from continuing operations increased by £492.2 million, or 33.3%, to £1,971.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, or 82.7% as a percentage of revenue, from £1,479.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, or 69.0% as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to significant cost inflation for raw
materials feedstocks across the portfolio.

_Gross Profit – Continuing operations_

Gross profit from continuing operations decreased by £252.5 million, or 38.0%, to £412.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, from £665.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to

Administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by £29.5 million, or 24.4%, to £91.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, from £121.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to
a reduction in staff bonuses, and reclassification of costs to sales and marketing costs.

_EBITDA – Continuing operations_

EBITDA from continuing operations decreased by £248.8 million, or 50.0%, to £249.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from £498.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the significant
reduction in profits in the NBR gloves business, partially offset by the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business
and smaller movements in other divisions.

EBITDA in the Performance Elastomers segment decreased by £271.6 million, or 84.7%, to £49.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022, from £320.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the
significant reduction in profits in the NBR gloves business.

-----

EBITDA in the Functional Solutions segment decreased by £11.4 million, or 8.2%, to £127.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, from £139.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to reduced
volumes in the Coatings business, partially offset by increased volumes in the Energy Solutions business.

EBITDA in the Industrial Specialities segment increased by £8.4 million, or 35.9%, to £31.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, from £23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due improved
profitability and strong mix across its high-margin businesses.

EBITDA in the Acrylate Monomers segment decreased by £13.6 million, or 38.5%, to £21.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022, from £35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower sales
volumes and higher energy costs.

Adhesive Technologies was a newly formed division for the year end December 31, 2022, with no reported
EBITDA in the prior period.

_Depreciation and Amortisation – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying depreciation & amortisation from continuing operations increased by £21.5 million, or 33.0%, to
£86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,
primarily due to depreciation associated with the acquired Adhesives Resins Business.

_Operating Profit – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying operating profit from continuing operations decreased by £270.3 million, or 62.5%, to £162.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £432.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due
to the significant reduction in profits in the NBR gloves business, partially offset by the acquisition of the
Adhesives Resins Business and smaller movements in other divisions.

The table below outlines the Special Items for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and provides
a reconciliation between IFRS operating profit and underlying performance of operating profit from continuing
operations for each the following years:

(1) The financial information is derived from the comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in the
2022 Consolidated Financial Statements, which has been represented to give effect to the classification of the Laminates, Films and
Coated Fabrics Businesses as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 in accordance with IFRS 5. See Note 31
(Discontinued operations) to our 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) For further discussion of Special Items, refer to “—Operating Profit—IFRS” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”

_Operating Profit/(loss)—IFRS – Continuing operations_

Operating profit/(loss) from continuing operations decreased by £317.0 million, or 106.9%, to a loss of
£20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from a profit of £296.5 million for the year ended

79


-----

December 31, 2021. Operating loss attributable to Special Items increased by £46.7 million, to £183.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, from £136.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The amortisation of acquired intangibles relates to acquired customer relationships. Amortisation of acquired
intangibles increased to £44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from £30.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as a result of the amortisation on the customer lists, patents, trademarks and trade secrets
arising as a result of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business. The fair value of the intangible assets
arising on the acquisition, amounting to £273.2 million, are being amortized over a period of 8-20 years.

Impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to a £133.7 million non-cash impairment charge
taken in the year relating to the Adhesives Technologies division. This reflected reliability and supply chain issues,
which we are working to resolve, and lower-than-expected capacity acquired, reducing the forecast earnings from
the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business used for impairment testing.

Restructuring and site closure costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 comprised £9.6 million in charges
related to the ongoing integration of the Adhesive Resins Business into the newly formed Adhesive Technologies
division, a £3.2 million charge in relation to site closure of one of the smaller sites in Malaysia and a further £6.7
million, in relation to further demolition and site rationalization costs, as well as costs in relation to our strategy
change and alignment of our business into its new divisions effective in 2023.

Acquisition costs and related gains for the year ended December 31, 2022 include £11.9 million of costs related
to the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business, which primarily consist of professional adviser fees, and are
offset by a £5.4 million gain on a foreign exchange derivative entered into in October 2021 to hedge the acquisition
price. Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 are also related to costs associated with the
acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business.

Loss on the sale of business for the year ended December 31, 2021 related a £7.1 million loss on an onerous
contract arising on the disposal of the European Tyre Cord business in 2020, required by the European
Commission Competition Authority in order to obtain clearance for the acquisition of OMNOVA.

Regulatory fine relates to the impact of the European Commission’s investigation into styrene monomer
purchasing practices of a number of companies, including Synthomer, operating in the European Economic Area.
We fully cooperated with the Commission throughout the investigation. For the year ended December 31, 2021,
based on the information available and the resulting assessment of the expected outcome of the investigation, we
made a provision of £57.2 million. In 2022, the European Commission concluded its investigation, resulting in a
fine of £38.5 million. We had a related provision of €43 million (£38 million as of December 31, 2022 and £38.4
million as of December 31, 2023), with the final amount being €44.3 million, paid in January 2024.

_Finance Costs – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying finance costs from continuing operations increased by £15.4 million, or 50.7%, to £45.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, from £30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was primarily
due to an increase in interest payable as a result of additional debt utilized to finance the acquisition of the
Adhesives Resins Business, which completed in April 2022, as well as the effect of higher base rates.

_Profit Before Tax – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

As a result of the foregoing, underlying profit before tax from continuing operations decreased by £285.7 million,
or 71.0%, to £116.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from £402.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021.

_Taxation – Underlying Performance – Continuing operations_

Underlying taxation from continuing operations decreased by £66.0 million, or 70.5%, to £27.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022, from £93.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate
on Underlying performance remained relatively stable, increasing to 23.6% for the year ended December 31,
2022, from 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated
from operations and any borrowings under our financing arrangements (including the Factoring Facilities (as
defined herein)). Our liquidity needs consist primarily of funding operating expenses, capital expenditures,
strategic acquisitions, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time.

We regularly review performance against budgets and forecasts to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet
our contractual obligations and liquidity requirements. We believe that following the Offering, and the use of
proceeds therefrom, our operating cash flows, borrowing capacity under our financing arrangements and the
proceeds of the Notes offered hereby will be sufficient to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements
and commitments. Our actual financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, however, some of which
may be beyond our control. See “Risk Factors” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**Cash flow and net debt analysis**

The following table sets out our consolidated cash flow and net debt information for each of the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:

**Year ended December 31,**
**2021** **2022** **2023**
**£ millions**
**Net cash inflow from operating activities ...................................** **273.5** **133.9** **150.0**
**Net cash (outflow)/inflow from investing activities ...................** **(78.6)** **(848.2)** **107.7**

assets ................................................................................ (82.2) (90.8) (84.0)
Purchase of business ............................................................... — (759.6) (18.4)
Proceeds from sale of business ............................................... 1.7 (0.3) 208.2
**Net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities ...................** **118.5** **414.5** **(90.9)**
**Increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and bank**

**overdrafts during the period ....................................................** **313.4** **(299.8)** **166.8**
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts at January 1 .............. 191.3 505.3 209.2

**Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts at December 31 ..** **505.3** **209.2** **370.6**

**Net debt[(1)] ......................................................................................** **114.2** **1024.9** **499.7**

(1) We define net debt as total current borrowings (including bank overdrafts) and non-current borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

Net debt exclude lease liabilities.

**_Operating activities_**

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £16.1 million, to £150.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, from £133.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to tax refunds for
overpayments in prior years in certain jurisdictions and reduced pension deficit payments, offset by increased
financing costs and reduced EBITDA.

Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £139.6 million, to £133.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from £273.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to reduced
EBITDA and extra borrowing costs from the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business, and partially offset
by lower tax paid and working capital inflows from receivables financing.

**_Investing activities_**

Net cash outflow from investing increased by £955.9 million, to a net cash inflow £107.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, from a net cash outflow of £848.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
primarily due to the sale proceeds from the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses and the prior year
acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business.

81


-----

Net cash outflow from investing activities increased by £769.6 million, to £848.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from £78.6 million for year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of
the Adhesives Resins Business.

**_Financing activities_**

Net cash inflow from financing activities decreased by £505.4 million, to a net cash outflow of £90.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2023, from a net cash inflow of £414.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, primarily due to the impact of increased borrowings to support the purchase of the Adhesive Resins Business
in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of equity securities issued in the current year.

Net cash inflow from financing activities increased by £296.0 million, to £414.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, from £118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased
borrowings to support the purchase of the Adhesive Resins Business, and partially offset by the impact of equity
securities issued in the prior year.

**Capital expenditure**

Capital expenditure, which represents purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as recorded
in our consolidated cash flow statement, decreased by £6.8 million, or 7.5%, to £84.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, from £90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased
constraints on discretionary spend.

Capital expenditure increased by £8.6 million, or 10.5%, to £90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
from £82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to investments in our
Pathway Program systems transformation project, the integration of SHE standards across our business targeted
at improvement projects and SHE compliance issues, investments in plant sustenance and the effect of nine months
of trading for the Adhesive Resins Business, partially offset by increased constraints on discretionary spend.

We divide our capital expenditures into two categories: maintenance and growth. Maintenance capital
expenditures are classified as those capital expenditures which are needed for plant sustenance and to support
current operations and capital expenditures related to safety, health and environment-related updates. Growth
capital expenditures are classified as capital expenditure which are used to fund expansion, debottlenecking and
other similar investments to facilitate the growth of revenues or improvement of our margins and our systems,
including our Pathway Programme. We have historically had relatively low maintenance capital expenditure
requirements of approximately £45 million to £55 million, which has given us the flexibility to invest in growth
capital expenditure to enhance our operations and systems.

Our growth capital expenditure and maintenance capital expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2023
amounted to £53.3 million and £30.7 million, respectively, of our total capital expenditure of £84.0 million for
the same period.

**Working capital**

We define working capital as inventories plus trade and other receivables less trade and other payables. Our
working capital requirements are affected by seasonality which affects our sales volumes and movements in the
prices of raw materials. Working capital levels typically develop in line with changes to raw material prices,
although timing factors can affect flows of capital.

**Contractual obligations**

We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

The following table details our contractual obligations for financial liabilities, including our main contractual
obligations after giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, but excluding interest payments.
The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which we may be required to repay amounts outstanding.

(1) Represents the aggregate principal amount in pound sterling of the €350.0 million Notes offered hereby as determined using the closing
exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671.

(2) Represents an estimated €150.0 million aggregate principal amount in pound sterling of the Existing Notes, assuming that principal
amount equal to the Maximum Tender Amount of €370.0 million is tendered and accepted for purchase, as determined using the closing
exchange rate on December 31, 2023 of €1.00 = £0.8671. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Summary—The Transactions.”

(3) On October 10, 2022, the Issuer, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the UKEF Facilities Agreement, which provides
for unsecured euro term facilities in an aggregate amount of €287.5 million and unsecured dollar term loan facilities in an aggregate
amount of $230 million. The UKEF Facilities mature on October 11, 2027 and are available for drawing until the earlier of October 10,
2024 or the date that the facility is drawn in full. As of December 31, 2023, the UKEF Facilities were fully drawn.

(4) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have €300 million in borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, which
remains undrawn. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement must be repaid in full on the termination date,
which, as extended pursuant to the RCF Amendments, is July 31, 2027.

(5) Represents bank overdrafts as of March 31, 2020.

**Pension liabilities**

We have funding requirements relating to defined benefit pension scheme obligations, the value of which are
dependent on fluctuating financial markets. As of December 31, 2023, our net pensions deficit totaled £64.7
million, of which £60.4 million related to pensions in Germany, £8.2 million, related to pensions in the United
States and £12.6 million related to pensions other countries (excluding the UK, which had an overfunded balance
of £16.5 million).

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of
the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates
of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Our UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the Group in separate
trustee-administered funds. We also operate a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany, which are closed
to new members. In line with common practice, our German schemes are unfunded, with liabilities settled on a
cash basis by the respective companies as they fall due. The assets of our other overseas schemes are held
separately from those of the Group.

In 2009, the UK scheme was closed to new participants and also to future accrual for existing participants.
Through commitments to our pension deficit recovery plan, announced in 2015, we eliminated our UK pension
shortfall (as calculated in accordance with IFRS) in 2022. Our US defined benefit pension scheme has been closed
to all new hires and, since 2011, future service benefits have been frozen and fully vested for all participants.

Our pension contributions and liabilities are subject to changes in the discount rates and mortality actuarial
assumptions applied, movements in the financial markets, including inflation, as well as movements in exchange
rates. For example, our net retirement benefit obligations decreased by £8.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2023, as compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to an £11.1 million gain from changes in demographic
assumptions, with changes in discount rates driving both a £16.2 million increase in expected return on plan assets
and £22.7 million increase in plan liabilities.

**OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

On December, 15 2022, Synthomer Deutschland GmbH as German originator and OMNOVA and Synthomer
Adhesive Technologies LLC as US originators entered into the Factoring Agreements, pursuant to which the
purchaser made available the factoring facilities (the “Factoring Facilities”). On June 27, 2023, the Factoring
Facilities were amended to include Synthomer Trading Ltd, Synthomer (UK) and Synthomer Middelburg BV as
originators, and on December 15, 2023, the Factoring Facilities were further amended to include Synthomer USA
LLC as an originator. In addition, we had contracted capital expenditure commitments of £8.8 million as of
December 31, 2023.

As mentioned below under “—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk,”
we have a policy of hedging all significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at the operating company
level. We borrow a proportion of our funding in overseas currencies to hedge the net assets held in those
currencies.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ON MARKET RISK**

We are, in the normal course of business, exposed to a variety of financial risks, including market risks and interest
rate risks. For additional information, see Note 22 (Financial instruments) of the 2023 Consolidated Financial
Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

A significant proportion of our revenue and assets are in currencies other than pound sterling and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates may significantly impact our results. We have a policy of hedging all significant foreign
exchange transactional exposure at operating company level and borrow a proportion of our funding in overseas
currencies to hedge the net assets held in those currencies.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Our balance sheet and cash flow position, and credit market conditions and credit ratings, may restrict our ability
to obtain credit facilities or to refinance existing debt facilities in the longer term. We closely monitor our
operating cash flow and capital expenditure on a monthly basis and regularly reviews covenant compliance.

**_Pension Funding Risk_**

We have funding risks relating to defined benefit pension scheme obligations, the value of which are dependent
on volatile financial markets. The UK scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009 and additional contributions
and careful asset management should reduce the deficit over the longer term. The timescale will be affected by
movements in the financial markets and the discount rate.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We finance our operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. We monitor interest rate
trends regularly, through discussion with our banks, and fix interest rates when it is prudent to do so. The following
table illustrates the effect on the consolidated income statement and items that are recognized directly in equity
for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 that would result from reasonably possible movements

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**Our Industry Overview**

We operate at the speciality chemicals stage in the chemicals value chain, which involves taking raw material
inputs and building complex chemical outputs utilized by customers in a variety of end products and downstream
industries.

Since January 2023, our new divisional structure increases our end market orientation, as indicated below.

_Source: Company information_

The growth drivers of each of our product types across end markets and geographic regions are supported by mega
trends including: (i) accelerating urbanization resulting in migration from urban areas to cities and an increase in
infrastructure developments, (ii) demographic changes and social changes, such as an ageing population and a
growing middle class in certain emerging markets, (iii) increased focus on climate change and sustainability,
including the impact of an increasing global focus on energy reduction and more sustainable products, which in
turn increases demand for lower carbon products more circular products as well as adaptive products for a wider
variety of weather conditions, and (iv) a shifting economic center of gravity toward Asia. Due to our balanced
product mix and our global asset footprint, with exposure to both emerging and developed markets, we are well
placed to capture market growth.

**End Markets, Market Share and Outlook for Our Divisions**

We benefit from providing goods to a diverse range of end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 30%
of our sales went to Adhesives, 18% to coatings, 10% to consumer materials, 9% to construction, 8% to health &
protection, 8% to paper and carpet, 5% to energy solutions and 12% to other performance materials. The following
paragraphs provide further details into our end markets, market shares and our divisions.

**_Coatings and Construction Solutions (Aqueous – acrylic and vinylic – dispersions)_**

Dispersion products are sold predominantly to paint and coatings manufacturers and formulators of adhesives and
construction products (such as sealants, fillers and caulks) with exposure to globally growing market segments.
Strong application know-how is required to support this commercial offering.

86


-----

There are continued significant regulatory drivers that support water-based technologies across end markets, since
water-based products tend to have lower levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOCs”) than solvent-based
products. There is a general trend in the industry towards producing more sustainable products including the
elimination of VOCs from coatings and adhesives formulations, since VOCs can contribute to climate change and
have unfavorable toxicological and odor characteristics. Acrylic, styrene-acrylic and vinyl dispersions contain
significantly lower levels of VOCs than solvent borne coatings formulations.

Our range of acrylic dispersions includes products for use in emulsion surface coatings, primers, interior and
exterior wood varnishes, floor paints and roof coatings.

Our range of styrene-acrylic dispersions is focused on products for use in interior and exterior emulsion paints
and roof coatings and also has applications in packaging adhesives. Our range of vinyl acetate dispersions includes
products for applications in interior and exterior emulsion coatings and adhesives for packaging, tiles & wood and
sealants for construction applications.

The European dispersions competitive landscape is fragmented, and according to Kline, we have the secondlargest market share in Europe and the Middle East for acrylic and vinylic dispersions, with approximately 13%
of the market as of March, 2024. Our largest competitors, BASF and Dow, have approximately 18% and 8%
respectively. The global market for coatings and construction is estimated to grow at a CAGR of approximately
3% per annum from 2022 to 2026.

The outlook for demand in Europe and North America is positive and growing with environmental regulations
driving an industry shift toward water-based products, which further strengthens their underlying growth trends.
In Southeast Asia, the market growth forecast remains strong, while the Middle East construction sector remains
subdued.

This sector is characterized by innovation and the development of bespoke solutions for customers with products
specified for particular use. Given the bespoke nature of many of our customers specialty products, we benefit
from long-standing customer relationships as customers face high costs for switching suppliers.

**_Adhesive Solutions (Tackifying resins and additives for adhesive products)_**

With 6 manufacturing sites across North America, Europe and Asia, along with access to additional sites hosted
by other Synthomer divisions, to service our emulsion polymers customers, we have leading market positions
(first and second in EMEA and the Americas, respectively) in an addressable market of approximately $12 billion.
With the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business, we now have a differentiated and diversified platform
with strong R&D and technical capabilities and a large and growing portfolio of products in hygiene, packaging
and high-performance tire additives.

Innovation is supporting extra growth and price differentiation in attractive end markets with resilient and GDP+
growth fundamentals.

_Source: Company Filings_

Tackifying resins are key adhesive components providing sticky properties made from hydrocarbons or pine
chemicals mixed with polymers for hot melt adhesives used in hygiene adhesives, packaging, rubber and tapes
and labels. The global tackifying resins market is estimated to be approximately 3.1 megatonnes, of which
approximately 62% consists of hydrocarbon resins. Hydrocarbon based tackifiers are seeing an increased market
share in specific applications due to pricing, stability.

Pure Monomer Resins (“PMRs”) are mainly used for adhesives in packaging and book binding due to their tack
properties, but are also used in thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) over-molding and tires. PMRs are used as an
additive in tire treads to improve performance, and demand for high-performance tires is growing as governments
impose more stringent performance regulations. Overall, the growth rate of the global market for PMRs is
expected to be a CAGR of approximately 2% per annum from 2022 to 2027.

Specialty rosin resins are natural tackifying resins with a wide range of characteristics used to provide stickiness
to the final product, with main end markets being adhesives, inks, pavement marking, chewing gum, synthetic
rubbers and tires. Overall, the growth rate of the global market for specialty rosins is expected to be a CAGR of
approximately 3% per annum from 2022 to 2027.

Amorphous polyolefins (“APOs”) have three main applications: hot melt adhesives (packaging, hygiene, building
and construction and automotive end markets), rheology modification (bitumen roofing and road markings) and
sealing (windows and cables used in construction). APO demand was estimated by us to be approximately 150
kilotonnes in 2023, with hygiene being the largest segment and expected to grow the fastest. Overall, the growth
rate of the global market for APOs is expected to be a CAGR of approximately 5% per annum from 2022 to 2027.

The overall market demand for adhesive solutions is estimated to grow at a CAGR above GDP in the medium
term.

**_Health & Protection_**

_Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR)_

Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (“NBR”) products are used in the manufacture of dipped products for medical, industrial
and household applications, the largest being protective gloves. We offer a range of NBR products for use in the
manufacture of thin-walled gloves for medical and laboratory use and heavy-duty gloves for household and
industrial applications. NBR latex products are sold globally to gloves manufacturers, including both large
diversified medical and consumer goods companies and smaller niche manufacturers.

88


-----

NBR competes with Polyvinyl Chloride (“PVC”) and natural rubber in this market. The potential for natural
rubber to cause allergies due to a naturally occurring protein among some glove wearers is leading to increased
substitution by NBR. NBR is expected to continue to gain share over PVC and natural rubber with estimated
CAGR of more than 6% over the coming years. Southeast Asia will remain the hub for gloves with over 80% of
global production and major investments in manufacturing capacity, even with Europe and North America
investments accelerating supported by government incentives to secure local supply.

NBR was the leading synthetic latex polymer used in Southeast Asia in 2023, representing 45% of the market by
volume, followed by styrene acrylics (dispersions) and pure acrylics (dispersions) at 17% and 11%, respectively.

We have developed innovative self-cross linking nitrile latex that eliminates the need for accelerators, which
improves the benefit and reduces any risk in use for glove wearers. In 2023 the Group recently developed and
commercialized the Group’s patented SyNovus™ Plus alternative to conventional NBR latex for nitrile gloves,
which provides medical glove makers with the same high performance barrier protection while being recyclable
and reducing GHG emissions.

We have the second-largest market share globally, with approximately 15% market share as of 2023. Our largest
competitors are Kumho Petrochemicals, LG and Nantex, which had 24%, 12% and 9%, respectively, of the global
market as of 2023. NBR market growth from 2010 to 2020 averaged greater than 8% per annum due to superior
chemistry and performance compared to natural latex and PVC.

The exceptional global demand for NBR gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a record performance
for NBR in 2021. After 2021, destocking of nitrile gloves caused substantial softening of demand, resulting in
lower NBR volumes in 2022, while China became a significant producer of gloves and NBR, resulting in
additional oversupply. While underlying end-customer demand for medical gloves remains similar to pre-COVID
levels and we see favorable growth trends in the medium term, the destocking impact was still persistent in 2023.

However, the outlook for underlying demand remains in line with strong growth due to the hygiene megatrend
and growth in use of emerging markets, with growth forecast to more than 6% per annum. The business is wellpositioned to capture this long-term opportunity.

Our goal is to grow sales into higher margin customer segments by offering best in class technical support,
leveraging long term contracts and investing in innovation, with the Asia Innovation Center (the “AIC”) as the
center of excellence for global glove innovation.

_Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR)_

Styrene Butadiene Rubber (“SBR”) is sold primarily to the speciality segments of the paper, construction, textile
and floor coverings markets, as well as adhesives and foams.

In coated paper applications, the addition of a latex coating contributes to the quality of the end product by
providing gloss, smoothness, fiber coverage, stiffness and brightness for various types of paper and board.
Furthermore, latex assists the processability and/or runability of the coating color. SBR is the dominant binder in
the paper industry.

In construction applications, SBR is used as an additive in cement and asphalt to improve tensile strength and
ductility and enhance resistance to water and other solvents, thereby prolonging the useful life of the asphalt or
cement.

In textile applications, SBR is used as a binder for non-woven fabrics such as those used in filters, wipes and
home furnishings. SBR provides the fabric with added softness, stiffness and strength. In addition, SBR is used
in upholstery back-coatings to improve shape and strength.

In the floor coverings market, SBR is widely used in the back-coating of carpets where the latex acts as an adhesive
for a secondary backing, holding the fibers in place and giving stability and strength to the carpet. Products for
the carpet industry are sold both directly to carpet manufacturers (a large number of which are located within the
Benelux region) and to intermediaries who provide ready-to-use blends to smaller customers.

89


-----

Latex foam is mainly used in mattresses, pillows and manifold cushioning materials, with the entire spectrum of this
varied product largely addressed through the use of different high solid SBR grades (HS-SBR latex), in order to
apply different degrees of firmness and elasticity to these products to suit consumer’s needs. Other applications
include uses in footwear, such as for inner soles.

The market growth for SBR approximately reflects growth in GDP, with uses in particular end markets reflecting
the growth of those end markets. SBR uses in paper latex markets have declined by approximately 1% to 4% per
annum since 2010, as consumers shift from paper-based to electronic media. This has been partly offset by growth
in foam, construction, compounds, packaging and cardboard markets.

We are focused on high value segments within the SBR business, as well as driving network efficiencies, which
will enable us to mitigate the effects of these sector tailwinds. We have the largest market share in Europe with
37% of the market as of 2023. Our nearest competitors are Trinseo and BASF, which have 25% and 18%,
respectively, of the SBR market in Europe as of 2023 according to Kline and internal company estimates.

Overall the growth rate of the global market for SBRs is expected to be a CAGR of approximately 1.9% per
annum from 2022 to 2026.

**_Performance Materials (Chemical additives and non-aqueous based chemistry)_**

Performance materials include several smaller niche performance materials businesses focused on markets
including paper, carpet, acrylate monomers, specialty vinyl polymers, elastomeric modifiers and inorganic
specialties. While these are attractive businesses where we have leadership positions, they have been assessed as
non-core to the wider Group strategy.

Our broad range of performance materials enable existing technologies to move up to the next level by improving
materials processability, decreasing carbon emissions and electricity consumption in the value chain, improving
recyclability of materials, reducing waste, or by helping customers creating light-weight materials. These
materials are used in high performance markets such as the automotive sector, PVC manufacturing, construction
and polymer manufacturing.

**_Attractive end markets aligned to long term growth megatrends_**

While the level of demand for each of our product types and in each of our end markets is affected by factors
specific to that product type and that particular end market, certain overarching global trends have an impact
across our product types and end markets. These include (i) accelerating urbanization resulting in migration from
urban areas to cities and an increase in infrastructure developments, (ii) demographic changes and social changes,
such as an ageing population and a growing middle class in certain emerging markets, (iii) increased focus on
climate change and sustainability, including the impact of an increasing global focus on energy reduction and
more sustainable products, which in turn increases demand for lower carbon products more circular products as
well as adaptive products for a wider variety of weather conditions and (iv) a shifting economic center of gravity
toward Asia.

We believe that these global macroeconomic trends, when combined with specific growth drivers within each of
our end markets and the nuanced strategic initiatives within each of our three divisions, contribute to the expected
growth of our business in excess of GDP.

_Coatings & Construction Solutions_

We expect both of the coating and construction end markets we serve from our Coatings & Construction Solutions
division to grow in excess of global GDP, as our focused strategy allows us to access end-markets growing in
excess of global GDP, supported by specific end-market growth drivers. Within the coating end market, we see
both an increased customer appetite for water-based coatings that replace or remove the need for harmful organic
solvents as well as revenue synergies derived from our previous acquisitions. Within the construction end market,
favorable global macroeconomic trends, such as increased urbanization and a growing middle class within urban
areas, as well as the professionalization of the construction business are driving long-term increases in demand
for our products. Further, this increase in demand is augmented by a healthy innovation pipeline of new products
to provide a wide range of solutions for our customers.

We aim to leverage these growth drivers as part of our division-wide strategy to (i) improve our geographical

**_Long standing, collaborative relationships with blue chip customer base_**

As of December 31, 2023, we have 36 manufacturing sites (with another announced closure underway) across 17
countries in the Europe, North America and Asia, resulting in a balanced geographic footprint with 49.8% of
revenues generated in Europe, 25.3% in North America, 17.4% in Asia and 7.5% in the rest of the world.

We served approximately 6,000 customers across the world in the year ended December 31, 2023, including many
global blue-chip companies. We believe we have strong and long-term customer relationships, with an average
length of 13-15 years. Our customer base is diversified and well-balanced across geographies and end markets.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, our largest customer represented approximately 3% of revenues from
continuing operations while revenues from our twenty largest customers represented approximately 24% of
revenues from continuing operations.

Some examples of key customers include: (i) with respect to Coatings & Construction Solutions, PPG Industries,
Inc., Baker Hughes, Akzo Nobel N.V., Sika AG, Proctor & Gamble Company and Haliburton Company; (ii) with
respect to Adhesive Solutions, Henkel Ltd, HB Fuller Company, Sherwin Williams Company, Pirelli & C. S.p.A.
and Continental AG; and (iii) with respect to Health & Protection and Performance Materials, Top Glove
Corporation Bhd, Sappi Limited, Riverstone Holdings Limited, Fomosa Plastics and the Condor Group.

**_Global manufacturing footprint with further simplification of asset base underway_**

We have a global manufacturing footprint utilizing state-of-the-art technology underpinned by our long-term
investment program in strategic sites. We have 36 manufacturing plans across EMEA, North America and Asia,
with 20 production facilities across Europe and the Middle East, nine production in North America and seven sites
in Asia. Given that many of our products are water-based, with approximately 50% or higher water content,
transportation and storage of these products can be costly due to the size and weight of water-based products as
well as the hazards inherent in transporting and storing chemicals. We therefore benefit from our asset base being
located in close proximity to many of our customers.

94


-----

Our asset base enables us to optimize production across our facilities, such as transferring products from one plant
to another to better match customer requirements, without the need to invest in significant capital expenditure. In
recent years we have invested capital expenditure into growth projects intended to expand and enhance our
production capabilities and make our processes more efficient. For example, in January 2024, in order to bolster
our supply chain, increase reliability and improve our cost position for hydrocarbon resin production in Europe,
we purchased certain raw material production assets from Arakawa, which will be managed under contract at the
Dow ValuePark in Germany. In addition, through non-core divestments and rationalization, including the decision
to mothball our NBR facility in Kluang, Malaysia, which is expected to reduce our NBR production capacity by
approximately 20%, and support better utilization levels across the Group, we are focusing on reducing
complexity and optimizing our site footprint under our strategy to “Focus, Strengthen and Grow”.

**_Impressive track record of new product innovation through sustainability and customer focused R&D_**

We have an impressive track record and pipeline of new product development through customer-focused R&D
which supports our strong cash profile. We maintain four Centers of Excellence as part of an innovation network
comprising 12 sites. Our four Centers of Excellence include sites in Germany and the U.S., as well as our industryleading Asia Innovation Centre and our state-of-the-art U.K. Innovation Centre established in 2019. In 2024, we
broke ground on a new innovation center in Shanghai, China, designed to support our customers. The China
Innovation Center will focus on the development of products that meet new environmental requirements,
including high-performance adhesives for lithium batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, water-based
coatings and adhesives, and plastic modification and recycling. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we
invested £34 million in R&D and launched 14 new products. These investments in R&D continue to have a
significant effect on our revenues, with 22% of our sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2023 derived
from products that we developed in the previous five years or are protected by patent or other intellectual property
protections. We currently employ approximately 380 professionals in R&D-focused roles.

An increasing focus on sustainability is a key trend that, we believe, will increase customer demand as regulation
is driving the requirement for lower-carbon, bio-based and circular products. Our portfolio is positioned to help
drive circular solutions (for example, recyclable packaging) and our high-performance water-based polymers can
displace solvent-borne polymers, leading to further demand for the our products. As a recognized leader in waterbased and emission reducing polymers, this creates a huge opportunity for us. Our “Vision 2030” plan is a longterm, embedded part of our business strategy, which we expect to be a value driver and a key principle in our
responsible approach to doing business. Our “Vision 2030” plan includes targets for the areas where we can have
the most material impact, including:

  - at least 60% of new products having enhanced sustainability benefits by 2030 (64% as of December 31,
2023);

  - reducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 47% relative to 2019 baseline levels, which
have been adjusted to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (42% reduction
as of December 31, 2023);

  - reducing Scope 3 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 28% relative to 2019 baseline levels, which have
been adjusted to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (14% reduction as of
December 31, 2023); and

  - at least 40% women in senior management roles (30% as of December 31, 2023).

We have a long track record of helping customers towards their own sustainability goals. Our emission-reducing
solutions and lower-carbon intensity operations all make a positive contribution towards customers’ Scope 3
carbon footprints. Our capabilities and products can help customers in multiple areas, whether that is replacing
solvent-based coatings with water-based alternatives, developing water-based polymers and re-dispersible
powders for construction customers, or innovating bio-based, low-carbon footprint and circular solutions for
adhesives.

**_Clear direction to increase specialization, grow global position and streamline operations_**

We have developed a well-balanced and diversified portfolio through a combination of organic and inorganic
growth and a continued repositioning towards specialty and complex formulations, supported by our robust R&D
activity, which helps to make our revenue more resilient to negative fluctuations in the demand for any particular
product or from any specific customer or geography. As we grow and capitalize on the underlying macroeconomic
trends in the speciality chemical industry, we have a clear path to increasing our product mix towards speciality
chemicals as we balance the geographic distribution of our end markets and streamline operations. A diverse
portfolio lends itself toward an increasing focus on high-value specialty chemical products for attractive and
resilient niche markets characterized by growth in excess of GDP.

Over the past year, we have increased our proportion of speciality chemicals from roughly 50% of our production
in 2022 to approximately 55% in 2023, as we look to drive this percentage higher toward 70% speciality chemical
weighting in the future. Our focus on the key value drivers for the speciality chemical market, including high
customer intimacy, value-based pricing, application innovation and flexibility in production in logistics, provides
a clear path to achieve this weighting.

Further, we aim to balance our geographic revenue distribution between EMEA, the United States and Asia. We
derived approximately half of our revenues in 2023 from EMEA, with the remaining half split between the United
States and Asia. As we seek to optimize our geographic footprint, we intend to increase our presence in the United
States while maintaining our presence in Asia, such that approximately 40% of our revenues are from EMEA,
approximately 35% from the United States and the remaining quarter from Asia. The following figure illustrates
our evolving geographic footprint, speciality chemical weighting and number of sites:

We aim to accomplish this geographic rebalancing while we streamline our operations, such that we move from
more than 40 sites in 2022 to less than 30 sites in strategic locations in the future.

**_Experienced management team with impressive track record_**

Our senior management team has strong industry experience with a demonstrated track record of achieving
profitable growth in the speciality chemical industry, successfully managing business portfolios through
acquisitions and divestments, disciplined capital investment plans and optimizing our fixed cost base. Michael
Willome, our chief executive officer, has led us since November 2021 after previously having served as chief
executive officer of another public global industrial company. Following the key acquisitions of OMNOVA in
2020 and the Adhesive Resins Business in 2022, our management team has effectively integrated these
acquisitions and we have been able to achieve synergies above initial projections in both acquired businesses.
Our management team has extensive experience in the speciality chemical industry, including working for leading
companies such as Conzzeta AG, Essentra plc, Chemtura, GE Speciality Chemicals and Clariant, and a proven
ability to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and working capital. We believe the
experience of our management team is a distinct competitive advantage. In addition, our senior management team
has demonstrated the ability to streamline our businesses by focusing on core competencies and divest of noncore businesses, as evidenced by the divestment of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses in
February 2023. The divestment of non-core businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core

**_Well-established financial policy with clear plan underway to further deleverage._**

We aim to maintain a conservative and sustainable capital management strategy with clear policies with respect
to our balance sheet leverage, and investments and shareholder returns in order to maintain an efficient and flexible
capital structure over a longer term. We take a disciplined approach to investment opportunities including mergers
and acquisitions and growth capital expenditure.

While our ambition historically has been to maintain a net leverage to EBITDA ratio, on an ongoing basis, of
approximately 1.0–2.0x, which we view as sustainable, our leverage is currently at higher than average levels,
due primarily to historically low NBR prices and demand as a result of destocking following the COVID-19
pandemic, combined with increased debt taken on to finance the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business.

We have responded to this challenge and in October 2023, completed a £276 million rights issue (net proceeds of
£266 million), demonstrating our commitment to reducing our leverage alongside other targeted actions,
including:

  - _Dividend suspension: In October 2022, we announced the suspension of all dividends for the year ended_
December 31, 2023 and an ongoing suspension until our net leverage is at least below 3.0x.

  - _Non-core divestment: The divestment of our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Business on February_
28, 2023 raised net cash proceeds of $262 million (with a further $5 million receivable in cash on the
13-month anniversary of completion), while supporting our ongoing drive to increase the speciality
weighting of the Group. Our non-core portfolio rationalization program remains ongoing, with three
further formal divestment processes currently underway.

  - _Cost savings: We reduced our capital expenditures in 2023 to £84 million (£91 million in 2022) and have_
deployed a discretionary cost-savings program that successfully saved the Group £18 million in 2023,
further targeting savings of £30-40 million annually from our new procurement program and
approximately £20 million from our Adhesive Solutions program over 2024 and 2025.

  - _Working capital improvements: We identified opportunities to optimize working capital, in particular for_
our Adhesives Solutions business, with an overall reduction in inventory of £46 million in 2023. In
addition, we instituted a receivables financing program, with a £27.9 million increase in receivables
financing to £110.6 million.

**Our Strategy**

Our growth strategy is driven by global megatrends and we are focused on driving sustainable growth through
business efficiency, R&D and capital investment projects. Our strategy is composed of the following key pillars:

**_Organic growth in attractive end markets_**

Our core strategic growth markets, comprising coatings, construction, adhesives, and health and protection, each
benefit from robust sectoral growth dynamics in excess of baseline GDP. These markets are driven by accelerating
global megatrends including accelerating urbanization, demographic and social change, climate change and
sustainability and shifting economic power. In October 2022, as part of its new strategy, we announced a new
divisional organizational structure aligning our organization with our core end-markets. This alignment of
operational segments and end-markets is expected to assist us in anticipating and meeting customers’ needs at
pace and deliver better products with improved margin and product differentiation.

Innovation and more sustainable products, such as water-based solutions displacing solvents in the construction,
coatings and adhesives markets, are key drivers of growth across the Group’s core markets and developing
products through focused customer-centric R&D is a key component of the Group’s strategy. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, 22% of our sales volumes were derived from products that we launched in the previous five
years or are protected by patent or other intellectual property protections. In the year ended December 31, 2023,
we launched 14 new products across multiple application areas.

**_Rigorous and consistent portfolio management to build focused, leading positions_**

As part of focusing the business, we intend to increase the weighting of speciality chemicals versus base chemicals
in our portfolio, create a more balanced geographic footprint, streamline our operations and apply more efficient
capital allocation across our businesses. During our strategic review in 2022, we identified our core markets,
which combine the most attractive growth prospects and where we are most differentiated. We are focusing our
resources on these segments and our new divisional structure enables differentiated steering in the allocation of
financial and operational resources in line with this strategy.

In addition, we identified a number of non-core businesses which have limited synergies with the rest our
identified growth platforms and which are less attractive areas for us to deploy capital. In line with our strategy,
on February 28, 2023, we completed the divestment of the Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses.
Moving forward, we will continue to assess our strategic position in terms of disposing of non-core businesses to
rationalize our portfolio, reduce complexity and increase our focus on attractive end-markets and speciality
products.

Our divisional structure enables a differentiated steering of the allocation of financial and operational resources,
including capital allocation. We aim to allocate approximately 75% of our capital to the Coatings & Construction
Solutions and Adhesive Solutions divisions and approximately 25% to the Health & Protection and Performance
Materials division over the medium-term.

While our primary focus is on furthering our non-core divestment program, alongside this we are actively
considering a number of low-capital growth opportunities, such as potential partnerships. We are also identifying
potential accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities in strategically attractive end markets and geographies for the
future, when our financial circumstances allow.

**_Operational and commercial excellence in how we run our business_**

We are focused on continuous improvement across our operations to advance production efficiency, sales
effectiveness and functional excellence while remaining committed to our sustainability standards. To achieve
these aims, we seek to identify good practice in all areas of the business and ensure that relevant learnings are
disseminated across the business.

We aim to drive profitability through maximizing the utilization of our assets. To achieve this, we focus on
identifying the root causes of production bottlenecks and finding innovative solutions. For example, a project at
our Longview site in Texas will debottleneck production and is expected to increase capacity by 10% to take
advantage of growth in the amorphous polyolefin market in North America.

For decades, we have been a world leading supplier of water-based polymers that avoid the use of solvents and
keep harmful VOCs out of the atmosphere. We have also become a global innovator in driving the use of waterbased technology. Over the last few years, we have worked to embed environmental sustainability into our
products and operations while remaining committed to driving efficiency. Sustainability now plays a major role
in our innovation agenda for customers, as well as our ongoing work to address our own greenhouse gas emission
footprint, as measured by our _“Vision 2030” roadmap and near-term milestone targets, as overseen by the_
Executive Sustainability Steering Committee established in 2022.

**_Diversity, equity and inclusion and holistic people development_**

Across all of our businesses, our employees execute our strategy and deliver for all stakeholders and we continue
to develop them to be prepared for the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. To support this, we are
implementing four strategic employee priorities: (i) promoting holistic people development; (ii) strengthening our
leadership capability; (iii) embracing Synthomer excellence; and (iv) establishing an innovative workplace
culture.

**Our History**

Our history can be traced back to 1863 to the founding of George Yule & Co., the predecessor of the Group, in
London. The Company was initially incorporated and registered in England and Wales with the name Malaya

99


-----

General Company Limited on June 16, 1908 as a private company limited by shares with registered number
00098381. The Company’s name was subsequently changed to Yule Catto & Co. Limited on September 16, 1971,
and on October 14, 1971, was listed on the London Stock Exchange.

By 1980, the Company was engaged in the operation of marinas, rubber and oil palm plantations, and had
investments in oil exploration. In that year, we acquired Revertex Chemicals Limited, an international group
engaged in the processing of natural rubber latex and the manufacture of synthetic rubber lattices, resins and
emulsions. In 1981, the Company changed its name to Yule Catto & Co. plc.

In 1998, the Company acquired Holliday Chemical Holdings plc, a manufacturer of a wide range of chemicals,
including active pharmaceutical chemicals, pigments, dyes and metal salt compounds. From 2006 to 2008, we
disposed a range of businesses to become a focused supplier of water-based polymers. In 2011, we acquired
PolymerLatex GmbH, headquartered in Marl, Germany, with operations in Europe and Asia, a manufacturer of
speciality polymers including SBR and NBR lattices and a range of acrylic dispersions.

In 2012, the Company changed its name to Synthomer plc, and in 2016, we completed the acquisition of PAC
from Hexion Inc. and sold Revertex South Africa (Pty.) Limited. In 2017, we acquired all of the issued share
capital of Speciality Additives, a niche performance additives business serving the decorative and industrial
coatings industries while in 2018 it acquired BASF Pischelsdorf. On April 1, 2020, we acquired OMNOVA, a
leading developer and manufacturer of emulsion polymers, speciality chemicals and decorative products. On April
1, 2022 we completed the acquisition of the Adhesive Resins Business, which develops, manufactures and sells
resins and polymers for adhesive products.

In February 2023, we completed the divestment of our Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics Businesses (which
included business lines previously acquired in the OMNOVA acquisition) to Surteco North America, Inc.

**Our Products**

We operate in the speciality chemicals stage of the chemicals value chain, which involves taking raw material
inputs and building complex chemical outputs utilized by customers in a variety of end products and downstream
industries.

Speciality chemicals are value-add products manufactured using polymerization and other reactive processes to
transform commodity raw materials into complex polymer chemicals. Speciality chemicals are then utilized in a
wide variety of downstream end-markets, including the healthcare, consumer goods and construction markets.
Some of the end-uses for speciality chemicals include, but are not limited to, medical gloves and fabric supported
gloves, coated paper and carpet backing, foams for mattresses and pillows, adhesives and cement modifiers.

We primarily produce water-based polymers through an emulsion polymerization process, which removes the
requirement for large amounts of organic solvents during production and use. These polymers are made up of
different chemical building blocks, or monomers, that lead to the different chemistry platforms in our portfolio.
The resultant water-based polymers have very low levels of VOCs, some of which can have harmful effects from
a health and wider environmental impact.

100


-----

We believe that we offer the widest range of chemistry platforms available in the market, and our product
development processes enable us to deliver the best value solutions to customers across the various types of
chemicals we offer. Our innovation model leverages our expertise across core chemistries and applications to
effectively deploy our core know-how in into a diverse portfolio of end-uses. For example, chemistry solutions
initially focused on improving the coating performance of water-based paints have been adapted to give enhanced
performance in nitrile glove applications, while other coatings products have been applied into oil and gas drilling
uses. Products which were originally developed for paper coating have been modified for use as a binder for the
anode of lithium batteries, opening a new growth market. Other polymers developed for use in paper have also
been introduced to modify cement admixtures to improve workability, flexibility and mechanical strength of a
construction mortar.

The growth drivers of each of our product types across end-markets and geographic regions are supported by
accelerating urbanization, demographic and social change, climate change and sustainability and shifting
economic power mega-trends. Due to a balanced product mix and global asset footprint, with exposure to both
emerging and developed markets, we believe that we are well placed to capture market growth.

**_Our Divisions_**

With effect from January 1, 2023, we implemented a new organizational structure, comprising three global
divisions through which the different product categories are developed and produced: (i) Coatings & Construction
Solutions; (ii) Adhesive Solutions; and (iii) Health & Protection and Performance Materials.

Our speciality growth platforms (Coatings & Construction Solutions and Adhesive Solutions) benefit from robust
growth dynamics, have strong and stable leadership positions within their markets and offer products that are
distinct from our competitors. Across these platforms, we are actively looking to strengthen innovation and our
technological position, broaden our offering of core products and enter attractive new speciality niches while
maintaining disciplined capital allocation.

The Health & Protection platform benefits from the attractive growth dynamics of the underlying medical glove
market but is generally more cyclical. We are currently seeking to enhance this platform through organic means
only, supported by expected sector growth in excess of global GDP.

Performance Materials are the non-core elements of our portfolio and include legacy non-core businesses from
the Performance Elastomer and Industrial Specialities divisions. This used to include the Laminates, Films and
Coated Fabrics Businesses, but these were sold to Surteco North America Inc. in a sale which completed on
February 28, 2023 for a total net proceeds of $269 million.

The divisions have a clear end-market focus:

   - **Coatings & Construction Solutions: speciality coatings, construction, fiber bonding, foam, energy,**

speciality additives.

   - **Adhesive Solutions: tires, hygiene, packaging, tapes and labels.**

   - **Health & Protection and Performance Materials: gloves, speciality paper coatings and carpet backing.**

_Coatings & Construction Solutions_

The Coatings & Construction Solutions division brings together a number of our prior business segments to focus
on end-markets where we have leadership positions and potential for growth. For the year ended December 31,
2023, the Coatings & Construction Solutions division generated revenue of £815.5 million (representing 41.4%
of revenue from continuing operations), EBITDA of £100.1 million (representing EBITDA margin of 12.3% from
continuing operations) and underlying operating profit of £73.3 million. The Coatings & Construction division
has approximately 2,100 employees across 18 manufacturing sites.

The Coatings & Construction Solutions division serves a diverse range of sectors and customers within its target
end-markets, with a focus on architectural and masonry coatings (27% of the division’s revenue from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2023), consumer materials (24% of the division’s revenue from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023), construction (21% of the division’s revenue from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023), industrial coatings (16% of the division’s revenue
from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023) and energy solutions (12% of the division’s
revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023).

Our Coatings & Construction Solutions division leverages our competitive advantage gained by the sustainability
benefits of water-based technologies in applications such as architectural coatings, coatings for wood and metal,
and automotive coatings. We also have strengths in the energy sector, where our advanced liquid and dry
cementing products as well as our high-performance drilling fluid additives are used in challenging operational
environments around the world (covering conventional and unconventional drilling and completion
requirements). In addition, we produce water-based anode binders, most notably SBR, that help deliver high
charge capacity, reliability and long life in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, energy storage and other
devices – supporting the transition to a decarbonized world. The key chemistries and product markets captured
by the activities of this division are set out below.

_(i)  Aqueous (acrylic and vinylic based) dispersions_

Dispersions products are sold predominantly to paint and coatings manufacturers and formulators of adhesives
and construction products with exposure to globally growing market segments. Strong application know-how is
required to support this commercial offering, as this market is characterized by innovation and the development
of bespoke solutions for customers. We benefit from this dynamic due to our longstanding customer relationships
reinforced by the high supplier switching costs for our customers.

There are continued significant regulatory drivers that support water-based technologies across end-markets, since
water-based products tend to have lower levels of VOCs than solvent-based products. There is a general trend in
the industry towards producing more sustainable products including the elimination of VOCs from coatings and
adhesives formulations, since VOCs can contribute to climate change and have unfavorable toxicological and

102


-----

odor characteristics. Acrylic, styrene-acrylic and vinyl dispersions contain significantly lower levels of VOCs
than solvent borne coatings formulations.

Our range of acrylic dispersions include products used in emulsion surface coatings, primers, interior and exterior
wood varnishes, floor paints and roof coatings. Our range of styrene-acrylic dispersions include products used in
interior and exterior emulsion paints and roof coatings and also has applications in packaging adhesives. Our
range of vinyl acetate dispersions includes products used in interior and exterior emulsion coatings and adhesives
for packaging, tiles and wood as well as sealants for construction applications.

We are the second largest producer in a fragmented landscape of acrylic and vinylic dispersions in Europe and
the Middle East by revenue and volume. Globally, we expect the market growth for acrylics dispersions to be
approximately 3% per annum from 2022 to 2026 according to Kline.

We believe that our position as a leading producer of water-based dispersions is supported by regulatory drivers,
since our water-based products remove the requirement to use harmful organic solvents in manufacture and use,
thus reducing environmental burden and potential health impacts. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Group sold 286 kilotonnes of dispersions products, constituting 22% of the Group’s revenues. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, sales of our dispersions products comprised a significant portion of the of our Coatings &
Construction Solutions division, in addition to a material portion of our Adhesive Solutions division. See “—
_Adhesive Solutions.”_

We produce dispersions at the Group’s manufacturing facilities in the US, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the UK,
the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Vietnam, Portugal and Saudi Arabia.

_(ii)  SBR latex_

SBR latex polymers are water-based synthetic polymers that are manufactured by a process called emulsion
polymerization. SBR latex is sold primarily to the speciality segments of the paper, construction, technical textile
and floor coverings markets, as well as adhesives and foams.

Latex foam, a high solid SBR, is mainly used in mattresses, pillows and manifold cushioning materials, with the
entire spectrum of this varied product largely addressed through the use of different high solid SBR grades, in
order to apply different degrees of firmness and elasticity to these products to suit consumer’s needs. Other
applications include uses in footwear, such as for inner soles. As part of our ongoing reorganization and
optimization efforts, in January 2024, we transferred our foam business to the Health & Protection and
Performance Materials division, and will be presented as such going forward.

We are the leading producer of High Solid & Carboxylated SBR in Europe by volume. The products have excellent
properties as binders in multiple industrial end-uses. We primarily produce SBR to be used in coated paper and
packaging; carpet backing; foam markets for use in mattresses, pillows and shoes; cement mortar; insulation
systems; waterproofing; and diaper components.

Our manufacturing centers for SBR products utilize our advanced manufacturing technology and are closely
integrated with our key raw material suppliers to ensure security of our raw material supply. In turn, our
manufacturing centers are also typically located close to our core customer base in order to support our customers’
logistical requirements. We produce SBR at our manufacturing facilities in Germany, Austria, Italy, the US and
China, with additional sites in the Netherlands and Egypt. We are continually evaluating and developing our
product offerings in order to meet customer needs and our SBR products have recently been used in a wide range
of products that support the energy transition.

We are focused on high value segments within our SBR business, as well as driving network efficiencies, which
we expect will enable us to mitigate the effects of these sector headwinds. We have a strong market position in
Europe.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold approximately 360 kilotonnes of SBR products constituting 19%
of the Group’s revenues. In the near-to-medium term, we expect growth in construction facing end-markets, with
a slight decline in the graphic paper market as customers continue to move to electronic media. We are also
continuing business development in high value applications of SBR, including oil fields and batteries. For the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, sales of our SBR products were primarily accounted for as part of our
Performance Elastomers segment and also accounted for a material amount of our Functional Solutions segment.

103


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2023, SBR products comprised a material portion of each our Coatings &
Construction Solutions division and our Health & Protection and Performance Materials division. See “—Health
_& Protection and Performance Materials.”_

_Adhesive Solutions_

The Adhesive Solutions division, which represented 29.5% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2023
(excluding inter-segmental revenue), is largely the successor of our former Adhesive Technologies segment, but
also includes elements of our former Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialties divisions. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, the Adhesive Solutions division generated revenue from continuing operations of £581.7
million, EBITDA of £31.2 million (representing EBITDA margin of 5.4%), and an underlying operating loss of
£7.5 million from continuing operations. The Adhesive Solutions division has over 700 employees across 6 plants
across North America, Europe and Asia.

The Adhesive Solutions division serves a diverse range of sectors and customers, with a focus on tapes and labels
(27% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023), plastic modification (16% of the division’s
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023), packaging (15% of the division’s revenue in the year ended
December 31, 2023), tires (13% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023) and hygiene
(12% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023). Other product markets comprise the
remaining 17% of the Adhesive Solutions division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023.

With six manufacturing sites across North America, Europe and Asia, and access to multiple sites of other
divisions, the Adhesive Solutions division has leading positions across all tackifier markets in an addressable
market of approximately $12 billion and one of the broadest offerings in the industry in terms of number of
products. Much of the division is formed from our purchase of the Adhesive Resins Business, which was
completed on April 1, 2022. We believe that adhesives is an attractive growth market, in which we are able to
offer a differentiated and diversified platform tailored to the needs of our customers and strong R&D and technical
capabilities. Our offering includes a large and growing portfolio of products in the tapes and labels, hygiene,
packaging, plastics and high-performance tire additives markets. For example, in 2023, we had two significant
product launches, including Plextol XA 2565, which allows tape manufacturers to achieve the adhesive
performance level of solvent-based adhesives with a water base, and Plastvance TR&E, which allows for reducing
the thickness of plastic packaging, and designing flexible and rigid packaging from only one recyclable material.
In addition, in 2022, we launched our amorphous poly-olefin (“APO”) polymer, the Aerafin 230, which allows
carmakers to formulate hot melt laminating adhesives for automotive interior applications, replacing Polyurethane
reactive adhesives (“PUR”). Aerafin-based adhesives eliminate the use of isocyanate crosslinkers that have to be
used with the PUR, a substance that is increasingly regulated. In the area of automotive sustainability, we also
developed a new modified silane resin which helps a tire making customer improve wet and dry grip for tires
while reducing rolling resistance, improving fuel efficiency.

The Adhesive Solutions division also offers increased specialization and attractive EBITDA margins, while
supporting our sustainability goals by offering renewable products and circularity options. This is supported by a
strong and embedded customer base of over 700 customers in more than 1,000 locations across the world.

The key chemistries and product markets captured by the activities of this division are set out below.

_(i)  Adhesive resins and polymers_

Adhesive, or tackifying, resins are key adhesive components providing tack and adhesion made from
hydrocarbons or pine chemicals. They are mixed with polymers for hot melt adhesives used in hygiene adhesives,
packaging, tapes and labels, and for modification of rubber and plastics. We develop, manufacture and sell
tackifying resins for adhesive products, for uses in end-markets such as packaging, hygiene and high-performance
tire additives. The majority of the tackifying resins for adhesive products that we produce are developed and
manufactured at sites that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business. For the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, sales of tackifying resins, polymers and additives for adhesive products were
accounted for as part of our Adhesive Technologies segment, and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
comprised the significant majority of our Adhesive Solutions division. For the year ended December 31, 2023,
we sold approximately 174 kilotonnes of adhesive products constituting 22.2% of the Group’s revenues.

104


-----

The global tackifying resins market in 2023 was estimated to be approximately 3.1 megatonnes, of which
approximately 62% consists of hydrocarbon resins. Hydrocarbon-based tackifiers based on C5 and C9 cracker byproduct streams are experiencing a solid market share in most applications due to pricing, stability, and
availability, with overall market demand for hydrocarbon tackifying resins estimated to grow in line with global
GDP growth. We maintain a strong market share within the global hydrocarbon resins market.

Pure Monomer Resins (“PMRs”) are used for hot melt adhesives in packaging and hygiene due to their tack
properties, but the largest market today is in rubber modification for tires and thermoplastic elastomer compounds.
PMRs are used as an additive in tire treads to improve performance, and demand for high performance tires is
growing as governments impose more stringent performance regulations, and electrical vehicles are growing.
Overall, we expect the global market for PMRs will grow in excess of global GDP. We have the leading position
within the global PMR market.

Speciality rosin resins are natural tackifying resins based on stabilized gum rosin harvested from living trees. With
a wide range of characteristics, rosin resins are used to provide adhesion to the final product, with main endmarkets being tapes, coatings, hot melt adhesives, food and beverage, tires and electronics. Overall, we expect the
global market for speciality rosins will grow in excess of global GDP. While our market share within the overall
global rosins market is small, we are amongst the top three businesses capturing market share in the more highly
specialized hydrogenated rosins market.

APOs have three main applications: hot melt adhesives (packaging, hygiene, building and construction and
automotive end-markets); rheology modification (bitumen roofing and road markings); and sealing (windows and
cables used in construction). APO demand was approximately 150 kilotonnes in 2023, with hygiene being the
largest segment and expected to grow the fastest. Overall, the growth rate of the global market for APOs is
expected to be approximately 3-4% per annum from 2022 to 2027. We are amongst the top three businesses
capturing market share within the global APO market.

_(ii)  Adhesive emulsions_

The second family of polymers we produce for application in the adhesives and sealants industry are adhesive
emulsions, which are part of the water-based dispersions category of product described above. Adhesive
emulsions are mainly pure acrylics or vinylics, and Emulsion polymers are primarily used for PSAs and release
coatings for the tape and label market, as well as polymeric binders for caulks and sealants. In June 2016, we
acquired PAC, which also gave us access to acrylic platforms in the PSA market. We project that pressure sensitive
tapes and label markets will both grow consistent with global GDP. We have a strong market share with respect
to water-based PSA, with clear differentiation from competitors.

_(iii)  Lithene polybutadiene_

The third polymer family serving the adhesives and sealants market are liquid polybutadiene polymers, including
LITHENE[TM]. Liquid polybutadiene polymers are used as modifiers in vulcanized rubber systems, and particularly
in sound dampening, bonding and sealing applications. We expect the market for liquid polybutadienes will grow
in excess of global GDP. We are among the top three businesses capturing market share within the liquid
polybutadiene market.

_Health & Protection and Performance Materials_

The Health & Protection and Performance Materials division, which represented 29.1% of our revenue from
continuing operations in 2023, combines the Health & Protection product portfolio (comprised mainly of NBR)
with the Performance Materials product portfolio (which includes SBR, chemical additives and non-aqueous
based chemistry products). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Health & Protection and Performance
Materials division generated revenue from continuing operations of £573.7 million, EBITDA of £31.0 million
(representing an EBITDA margin of 5.4%, and an underlying operating loss of £0.7 million from continuing
operations). The Health & Protection and Performance Materials division has 1,300 employees across 12 plants.

The Health & Protection and Performance Materials division serves a diverse range of sectors and customers,
with a focus on health & protection (24% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023), paper
(14% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023), rubber and plastic additives (17% of the
division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023), acrylic monomers (14% of the division’s revenue in
the year ended December 31, 2023), carpet (14% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023)

and compounds (8% of the division’s revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023). The remaining 9% of
revenue comes from sales to William Blythe Limited, a speciality chemical solutions company based in the UK.
In January 2024, the majority of our rubber and plastic additives businesses moved from the Health & Protection
and Performance Materials division to Coatings & Construction Solutions, while we transferred our foam business
from our Coatings & Construction Solutions division to the Health & Protection and Performance Materials
division.

The Health & Protection and Performance Materials division enhances protection and performance in a wide
range of industries, including medical glove manufacture, speciality paper, food packaging, carpet and artificial
turf and gel foam elastomers. We are a global leader in the NBR market, which our healthcare, food preparation
and hospitality customers use for glove dipping. The growth in urbanization and healthcare in emerging markets
is a particular opportunity. Around 400 billion gloves are used each year globally, but these are disproportionately
used in developed markets. Per capita use in the USA is 200 compared to 100 in Europe, and much lower in
developing regions. We believe that gap will close over time. While the NBR market can be volatile, it is a $2,000
million addressable market as of 2023, and we believe it is set to continue to grow due to the above market trends.

Health & Protection is the largest part of the Health & Protection and Performance Materials division, but we
operate a number of smaller, niche businesses under Performance Materials which focus on markets including
paper, carpet, acrylate monomers, speciality vinyl polymers, elastomeric modifiers and inorganic specialities.
While these are attractive businesses where we have leadership positions, we believe them to be non-core to our
wider strategy.

The key chemistries and product markets captured by the activities of this division are set out below.

_(i)  NBR latex_

NBR latex polymers are water-based synthetic polymers that are manufactured by an emulsion polymerization
process. The products have excellent barrier and tear-resistance properties and are resistant to oils and chemicals.
As NBR products do not contain the proteins which occur in natural rubber, they can also offer a hypoallergenic
alternative to natural rubber.

NBR latex products are used in the manufacture of dipped products for medical, industrial and household
applications, the largest being protective gloves. We offer a range of NBR products for use primarily in the health
and protection end-markets for use in the manufacture of thin-walled gloves for medical and laboratory use and
heavy-duty gloves for household and industrial applications. NBR latex products are sold globally to gloves
manufacturers, including both large diversified medical and consumer goods companies and smaller niche
manufacturers.

Globally, we are the second largest producer of NBR latex by volume. We have also made significant R&D
investment in NBR products in recent years which have driven our development of market leading products. Our
NBR products serve a fast-growing market which is expected to grow at a rate in excess of 6% during the coming
years. We have expanded our manufacturing capacity of NBR products in recent years, including a 60,000 tonne
per year capacity expansion at our existing manufacturing site in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia, during 2022. The Pasir
Gudang facility is the largest NBR manufacturer in Malaysia. In August 2023, we took the decision to mothball
our NBR facility in Kluang, Malaysia, which is expected to reduce our NBR manufacturing capacity by
approximately 20%, and support better utilization levels across the Group.

Our position as a supplier of NBR products is further strengthened by our geographic proximity to major glove
producers. We focus on NBR production primarily in Southeast Asia. In Europe, NBR is produced at our
manufacturing facility in Italy. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, sales of our NBR products were
primarily accounted for as part of our Performance Elastomers segment, and for the year ended December 31,
2023, comprise a significant portion of our Health & Protection and Performance Materials division.

Further, NBR latex competes with Polyvinyl Chloride (“PVC”) and natural rubber in this market. NBR is expected
to continue to gain share over PVC and natural rubber with estimated growth of 6%+ CAGR according to the
Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association over the coming years. Asia is expected to remain the hub
for gloves with over 80% of global production and major investments in manufacturing capacity, even with Europe
and North America investments accelerating supported by government incentives to secure local supply.

The exceptional global demand for NBR gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a record performance
for Performance Elastomers in 2021. After 2021, destocking of nitrile gloves caused substantial softening of
demand, resulting in lower NBR volumes in 2022. While underlying end customer demand for medical gloves
remains has remained similar to pre-COVID-19 levels for the past two years, the current divergence between
capacity and demand for NBR has been slowly abating, with volumes modestly improving in the third and fourth
quarters of 2023, although with low unit profit margins persisting. The following figure illustrates signs of abating
destocking across certain of our key customers.

The outlook for underlying demand remains in line with strong growth due to the hygiene megatrend and growth
in use of emerging markets. The business is well positioned to capture this long-term opportunity.

Our goal is to now grow sales into higher margin customer segments by offering best in class technical support,
leveraging long-term contracts and continuing to invest in innovation, with the Asia Innovation Centre as the
center of excellence for global glove innovation.

_(ii)  SBR latex_

The Health & Protection and Performance Materials division is also involved in the production of SBR latex,
particularly with respect to the production of speciality paper coatings and carpet backing. Our overall production
of SBR latex is described in greater detail above.

_(iii)  Specialties_

We produce polymers and speciality chemicals that are used in high performance markets such as the automotive
sector, PVC manufacturing, construction and polymer manufacturing. We have a highly diversified technology
base for speciality products which enables us to serve a range of high-performance applications segments. We are
a leading supplier of suspending agents used in the production of PVC with ALCOTEX[TM] polyvinyl alcohols.
Other applications include catalysts and flame retardants and a range of high-performance coating additives.

Specialities are used as key formulating components in certain of our core markets which allow us to cross-sell
our speciality products to existing customers. For example, certain of our specialities products are used to enhance
the performance of decorative and industrial paints, which is one of the core end-markets served by our dispersions
business. Our long-standing customer relationships enable us to develop bespoke solutions for our customers.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, sales of our specialities products were primarily accounted for
as part of our Industrial Specialties division, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, are included in our Health
& Protection and Performance Materials division and also our Coatings & Construction Solutions divisions.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 44 kilotonnes of industrial specialities products and derived 8%
of revenues from continuing operations from sales of industrial specialities products. We hold leading positions
in select niche specialities markets globally. Demand for more sustainable products, adoption of more sustainable
manufacturing practices by manufacturers, and emissions regulations provide our specialities businesses with

107


-----

opportunities for growth. For example, our powder coatings business, which manufactures solvent free products,
is well suited to grow due to demand from environmentally conscious customers.

We produce speciality polymers at our manufacturing facilities in the UK, Italy and Belgium.

_(iv)  Polymer modifiers_

Consisting of elastomeric modifiers and reinforcing resins, our polymer modifiers are used in a wide range of
plastic and rubber components, across an array of end-uses including automotive, wire and cable, belts and hoses,
construction, hose and tubing and footwear. In these product markets our expertise in NBR, SBR and acrylic
polymers have been applied to create solid, powder products to enable mixing with base polymers including
polyolefins, thermoplastic urethanes (“TPUs”), engineering thermoplastics, rubber and PVC to enhance
properties such as flexibility, toughness, durability and aesthetics. Because of the complex nature of the products,
the resulting performance of the end product is differentiated, typically higher value, and difficult for competitors
to replicate.

In some applications our polymer modifiers allow plastics and rubber producers to increase the performance and
value of lower cost polymers by making them more flexible, softer, lower gloss, or more durable. Other
applications include use in high value, engineering thermoplastics, such as polyacetal or TPUs to modify and
toughen them for specific application needs. These products also improve the processability of many polymer
systems, offering polymer compounders improved manufacturing productivity.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, sales of our polymer modifier products were primarily
accounted for as part of our Performance Elastomers segment, and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
comprise a portion of our Health & Protection and Performance Materials division. As of January, 1, 2024,
Polymer Modifiers are part of our Coatings & Construction Solutions division, and will be presented as such going
forward.

_(v)  Acrylate Monomers_

We produce all of our acrylate monomers from a single site at Sokolov, Czech Republic, which are in turn sold
externally to customers in European markets, as well as internally to our European Functional Solutions
dispersions business. While these are attractive businesses where we have leadership positions, we believe they
are non-core to our wider strategy.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold approximately 52.1 kilotonnes of acrylate products. We are
continuing to review potential options for new products, as our site is ISCC+ certified, allowing us to procure
biorecycled feedstock for low carbon products. We are also exploring collaboration with potential partners on
developing new bio-based products which would support our customers in achieving their net zero aspirations.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, sales of acrylate monomer products were accounted for as part
of our Acrylate Monomers segment, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, comprise part of our Health &
Protection and Performance Materials division.

**Customers And End Markets**

**_Customers_**

We have a diversified blue-chip customer base with long-term established relationships. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, we had approximately 6,000 customers worldwide. Our customer base has grown over time,
having increased by approximately 50% since 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our largest customer
represented approximately 3.1% of total revenues from continuing operations while revenues from our twenty
largest customers represented 23.7% of total revenues from continuing operations. Across each of our global
operating divisions are products that are typically integral components of our customers’ end products, resulting
in high switching costs for existing customers.

We monitor global trends, including demographic and political and economic trends, as well as market
developments to anticipate and meet our customers’ needs. We aim to design our chemical formulations to ensure
they not only meet the requirements of our customers but also those of the end-users of our customers’ products.

108


-----

Our technical services teams work with customers to ensure that we are providing the right formulation for their
needs.

One example of our product penetration, brand recognition, and integration with customers’ supply chains is our
PMR product line within the Adhesive Solutions division. We are viewed in the global adhesive industry as a
trusted long-term partner and the market leading supplier of high-quality speciality resins used in multiple
applications from tire tread compounds to pressure sensitive adhesives and medical packaging. Our broad product
portfolio, innovation, global manufacturing network, technical support and proximity to customers supports our
leading position. We have a decades-long history of supplying PMR across the globe, and our recent related
product launches of highly purified PMR for direct food contact applications and of reactive PMRs for high
performance tires have further strengthen our relationship with our customers.

The majority of customer contracts are structured to enable pass-through of raw material costs, enabling us to
support stable and sustainable margins. A significant proportion of our customer contracts typically have no
pricing commitment beyond one month, allowing us to modify pricing in line with raw material costs. Our
products are generally priced in accordance with one of two different types of agreements: (i) formulaic
agreements with price-indexed clauses and/or ICIS-related pricing, which provide for a high degree of direct pass
through of any changes in raw material prices to customers; and (ii) agreements renegotiated on a regular (usually
monthly) basis, in which our ability to retain the benefits of declines in raw material prices or to pass through
increases in raw material prices is affected by the supply and demand balance of the particular product as well as
the ability to apply pricing and margin enhancement tools according to customer relationships and the expectations
customers have in respect of these costs. Accordingly, substantially all of our customer agreements have no pricing
commitment beyond one month or one fiscal quarter, with approximately one third of our customer agreements
being formulaic with the remainder being generally negotiable on a monthly basis. Thus, we are generally able to
maintain our unit margins even when prices for raw materials experience sudden or sharp increases, although
there is typically a one-month or three-month lag time in our ability to do so.

**_End Markets_**

The products we offer have applications in a range of end markets. Our product line consists of wide range of
speciality polymers which are used as the base component or as a performance enhancing ingredient in materials
such as coatings, adhesives, construction materials, rubber, and plastics. The majority of these products are waterbased systems which are produced and used without the need for volatile organic solvents. For example, we
produce the polymers which are the base material in water-based paints which replace less sustainable solventbased coatings. The balance of our product portfolio consists of resins and polymers which are “100% active” in
use, meaning they are used in applications such as hot melt adhesive without the need for solvents or water carriers.
In all, our products enable the elimination of the use of solvents, thus eliminating emissions of VOCs to the
environment, some of which can have harmful effects on human health and the environment.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, Coatings & Construction Solutions (with end-markets uses including
architectural and masonry coatings, mortar modification, waterproofing and flooring, fiber bonding, and energy
solutions) was our largest division, constituting 41.4% of revenues from continuing operations for the year ended
December 31, 2023. Over the same period, our Adhesive Solutions division (with end-markets uses including
tapes and labels, packaging, hygiene, tires and plastic modification) constituted 29.5% of our revenues from
continuing operations, while our Health & Protection and Performance Materials division (with end-markets uses
including medical glove manufacturing, speciality paper, food packaging, carpet and artificial turf and gel foam
elastomers and vinyl-coated seating fabrics) constituted 29.1% of revenues from continuing operations.

**New Product Innovation**

New product innovation is an important component of our strategy and plays a key role in the success of our
speciality business segments. Our product development lifecycle begins within our business units, focusing on
identifying opportunities within our end-markets. Our market segment teams take a market-driven approach to
identify new product opportunities based on megatrends, segment drivers and individual customer input. Our
Innovation Excellence Framework guides our innovation process based on six “pillars of excellence,” including:
(i) aligning innovation resources to the business strategy; (ii) fostering creativity within our team and through
collaborations; (iii) incorporating process safety and sustainability into product design (iv) investing in people,
working in teams; (v) delivering excellence in project and portfolio management; and (vi) focusing on delivering

109


-----

results. Through our Innovation Excellence Framework in 2023, we increased our focus on skills development,
further implemented advanced experimental design and modelling and increased utilization of artificial
intelligence methods.

Our work on new product design, process improvements, and new application development aims to deliver more
sustainable innovations and offer value-added performance to our customers, while driving growth. We apply the
three principles of our “Technology Platforms” approach, namely (i) sustainability, (ii) enhanced performance,
and (iii) formulation and process efficiency; while identifying innovation opportunities through market research
and collaborations with customers.

We measure our overall innovation results in line with two key targets: (i) of the percentage of sales coming from
new and protected products (“NPP”) (where a new product is defined as launched in the past five years and a
protected product is one covered by a patent), for which we are targeting a level of at least 20% over the long
term; and (ii) the percentage of products launched in the prior twelve months which have a defined sustainability
benefit, for which are targeting a level of at least 60% by 2030, in line with our “Vision 2030” plan ambitions. See
“—Environmental, Social and Governance.” We have achieved our target NPP performance in each of the past
three years, with scores of 24%, 20% and 22% of total sales volume in each of the years ended December 31,
2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Since establishing the sustainable innovation target in 2021, we have made
important progress towards our goal, with the proportion of new products launched with sustainability benefits
rising to 64% for the year ended December 31, 2023 up from 50% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and
43% in for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In addition to our dedicated innovation teams within our business divisions, a dedicated Group Sustainability and
Innovation function oversees our worldwide innovation network, conducts research on new technology platforms
and provides centralized support for safety management, material characterization, process development,
intellectual property and regulatory compliance. Our Group Sustainability and Innovation function works closely
with our divisional business and innovation directors to investigate new product and process technologies (such
as biobased polymer chemistry) and provide new technology platforms from which to develop new products and
improve the operation of our plants. Examples of new products emerging from this source of innovation include
polymers for battery systems, innovative multi-surface architectural coatings, more sustainable construction
materials and higher performing adhesives for applications ranging from hygiene products to durable goods such
as mattresses and automotive. In recent years, our Group Sustainability and Innovation function has placed
increased focus on driving new manufacturing processes to improve productivity while reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, waste generation and water consumption, as well as the use of low carbon raw material sources.

Our innovation programs are focused on improving our margins and enhancing product differentiation. One key
element of our innovation strategy centers on the evolution of existing products to new applications and providing
tailored solutions to our customers. When performance targets are beyond the range of existing products, we

110


-----

employ our expertise in polymer design and product formulation to tailor existing products and change their
performance in order to meet customers’ specific requirements. Our expertise in the applications of our products
helps to add further value to our customers’ use of those products, including by allowing our customers to meet
their own sustainability targets. We are also able to leverage our core applications and technology across multiple
platforms.

For example, we are developing a new chloroprene-free contact adhesive as a direct result of customer requests,
and we have announced our intent to eliminate an emulsifier used in fiber bonding binders called alkylphenol
ethoxylates (APEO) by the end of 2024. This significant undertaking involves reformulating 17 products, and
customers have responded to the change faster than we anticipated and we are seeing growth in this business. In
our Adhesive Solutions division, we are working with a growing number of customers across the tire
manufacturing and hygiene industries to explore options to develop products with greater bio-based content and
better recycling qualities, while in Coatings and Construction Solutions, we have successfully produced our first
pilot-scale batches based on our new bio-based emulsion polymer platform for coatings. This has demonstrated
differentiated performance, and we expect initial customer sampling to take place in the first half of 2024.

We see further opportunities to participate in rapidly evolving markets such as 3D printing, and at the end of 2023
we launched a new toxin-free, biodegradable product that can be used in certain 3D printing molds, which can be
dissolved away in cold water once an object is printed.

We invested in extensive product and process innovation in 2023, with £34.0 million in R&D expenditures driving
continued innovation across our product lines. Our investments in innovation have increased as we have grown
organically and inorganically in recent years. In 2021, we fully integrated the OMNOVA innovation pipeline,
while opening our new Asia Innovation Center.

We launched 14 new products in the year ended December 31, 2023, and since 2020, we have filed patent
applications on 30 new inventions.

We work in partnership with our customers, using skilled technical services and R&D teams to develop products
that support our customers’ goals. Our manufacturing facilities are located in close geographic proximity to our
customers to enable continuous communication with and feedback from customers, which is then incorporated
into our product development process. We have several close, ongoing customer collaborations, which have led
to and are expected to continue to lead to new product innovations, such as differentiated APO grades which are
applicable to new application segments. Close collaboration with customers has included working directly at
customer sites during their production trials to support product implementation. We also have eight active
university collaborations to supplement our Technology Platform research programs, including with the
University of Warwick, University of Leeds, University of Manchester and the University of Montpellier These
collaborations are focused on research activities to underpin our commercial development activities to evaluate,
for example, new polymer systems, new process technologies and understanding the fundamental chemistry
during application. The collaborations also give us access to experts and facilities around the world, facilitate
recruitment of new talent into our organization, and support our wider objective to support education in the
chemical sciences.

We maintain four Centres of Excellence as part of an innovation network comprising 12 sites. Our four Centres
of Excellence include sites in Germany and the US, as well as our new industry-leading Asia Innovation Centre
and our state-of-the-art U.K. Innovation Centre established in 2019. In 2024, we broke ground on a new innovation
center in Shanghai, China, designed to support our customers in meeting their ESG objectives through product
innovation. The China Innovation Center will focus on the development of products that meet new environmental
requirements, including high-performance adhesives for lithium batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage,
water-based coatings and adhesives, and plastic modification and recycling.

**Environmental, Social and Governance**

Sustainability is at the core of how we work, think, operate and innovate. It’s about making sustainability central
to everything we do – whether that’s designing it into our products at the start of their lifecycle, embedding it into
our procurement processes, or and using it to shape our people agenda.

Our approach is informed by the issues that matter most to our stakeholders, including customers, employees and
investors, and that are most aligned with delivering our business strategy. We see sustainability as a value driver
and a principle for how we run our business.

To support the delivery of our business strategy we created our “Vision 2030” roadmap. The “Vision 2030”
roadmap includes a series of sustainability targets to help guide our decisions so we can make the most material
impact in this critical decade. We’ve also made a public commitment to reach net zero by 2050, in line with the
Paris Agreement negotiated at the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change. With more confidence
and a growing track record, we have taken steps to update some of our targets over time to become more precise
and demanding, while remaining practical. For example, in March 2023, we updated our Scope 1, 2 and 3 climate
targets to further bring us in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) criteria and on July 13, 2023,
our emission reduction targets were approved by SBTi.

The targets outlined in our “Vision 2030” plan include:

  - At least 60% of new products with enhanced sustainability benefits by 2030 (64% as of December 31,
2023);

  - Increasing our proportion of procurement spend with a sustainability rating to 80% by 2030 (46% as of
December 31, 2023);

  - Reducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 47% relative to 2019 baseline levels,
which have been adjusted to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (42%
reduction as of December 31, 2023);

  - Reducing Scope 3 absolute emissions by 28% relative to 2019 baseline levels, which have been adjusted
to take account of the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business (14% reduction as of December 31,
2023);

  - Reducing our recordable injury case rate per 100,000 hours for employees and contractors from 0.50 to
0.20 (0.16 as of December 31, 2023);

  - Reducing our process safety event rate per 100,000 hours for employees and contractors from 0.50 to
0.10 (0.18 as of December 31, 2023);

  - Deriving 80% of our electricity from renewable sources while improving energy efficiency in all our
operations (80% as of December 31, 2023);

  - At least 40% women in senior management roles (30% as of December 31, 2023); and

  - Providing volunteer support and financial contributions in excess of £1 million a year to advance
education, public health, diversity and environmental stewardship (£1.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023).

In addition, to map our progress towards each of the targets mentioned above, we have continued to deepen our
understanding of our climate related risks and opportunities in line with the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) through our ongoing scenario analysis work. Following an evaluation of the risk
presented by climate change, we determined to manage climate-related risks as an integrated component of our
principal risks. We consider physical risks to be the potential impact of droughts, flooding, fires, rises in sea level
and extreme temperatures on business operations, and transitional risks to be the potential impacts of carbon taxes,
market changes and environmental policy changes. Having completed the scenario analysis we identified five key
priorities for us as a business to respond to climate change. Our five responses (in order of priority) and the work
conducted in 2023 were:

1. _Work with selected suppliers: We have begun to engage suppliers of our key raw materials. Our_

immediate focus is to explore how to work with suppliers that can make the lowest-carbon monomers
from existing feedstocks. This is where we have the potential to make the most immediate impact on
Scope 3 emissions. In the medium term we are also working to identify and introduce alternative
feedstocks, including those from bio or circular sources where they offer a lower-carbon solution,
although we may have to consider trade-offs with other environmental factors, such as land use change.

2. _Reduce our Scope 1 emissions: We have taken significant action by ending the use of coal in our_

manufacturing sites. In the short-term, we are continuing to decarbonize our operations through process
optimization through our Manufacturing Excellence program. In the medium term we have active
projects focused on electrification, heat pumps and solar power, and for the long term we are involved
in a feasibility project for the use of green hydrogen at one of our key European sites.

3. _Reduce our Scope 2 emissions: Currently, approximately 80% of our purchased electricity comes from_

renewable sources and we aim to continue reducing and optimizing electricity and heat consumption in
the short-term. From 2024, we are working to enter into or expand power purchase agreements linked to
clean-energy generation.

4. _Innovate to decarbonize our products: We are continuing to create and respond to demand from our_

customers for more sustainable products. In 2023, we revised our product sustainability scorecard to
support the further prioritization of lower-carbon product development for commercialization in the
medium term.

5. _Enhance our physical resilience: Using the World Resources Institute (“WRI”) Aqueduct tools we have_

assessed the water-related risks at our own operations. We are now implementing improvement plans for
the three sites identified as being at high risk to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance.

Our objectives for 2024 include continuing to develop our approach to the risk presented by climate change by
reviewing our risk management framework by reference to the relevant TCFD requirements. and developing our
2050 net-zero transition plan in line with guidelines published by the Transition Plan Taskforce (“TPT”).

We have achieved several corporate ESG ratings, including an AA rating from MSCI in 2023, marking an upgrade
from our ‘A’ rating in 2021, and putting us in the top quartile of sustainability performance for companies in the
speciality chemicals sector. In addition, in 2021, we received an LSE Green Economy mark, which is awarded by
the London Stock Exchange to companies that earn more than 50% of their revenue from products that contribute
to environmental objectives. In 2023, we also retained our “Silver” status from EcoVadis, which is the only
universal sustainability ratings provider, and helps monitor the performance of companies’ upstream value chains.
In 2023, our CDP Climate score was improved to A- (Leadership Category). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to our Business—The third-party ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately_
_reflect our risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of_
_transparency or underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing_
_expectations from investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_

**Safety, Health and Environment**

**_Overview_**

Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive and continuously evolving environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations. These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling,
treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges, air emissions
(including greenhouse gas emissions), noise emissions, human health and safety, process safety and risk
management and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We have invested, and will continue to invest, financial and
technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with environmental requirements.

Our management believes that our operations are currently in material compliance with all SHE laws, regulations
and permits. We actively addresses compliance issues in connection with our operations and properties and
management believes that systems are in place to ensure that environmental costs and liabilities will not have a
material adverse impact on its business.

**_Occupational Safety Performance_**

We take a longer-term view of health and safety progress, as is market practice in our sector, using lagging
indicators which ‘smooths out’ minor deviations in performance. It also allows us to focus on longer-term
improvement trends, particularly as newly acquired businesses are integrated.

The main lagging indicator that we use to measure SHE injury performance is the recordable injury rate for
accidents involving more than first aid treatment per 100,000 hours worked. During the year ended December 31,
2023, we saw a recordable injury frequency rate of 0.16 per 100,000 hours worked, representing a significant
improvement on the prior year rate of 0.34, in part due to in part due to rigorously implementing our SHE
management system processes and standards and strengthening leadership on our sites. Our recordable injury
frequency rate has reduced from 2020 levels and we are continuing to implement improvements to bring our
recordable injury rate in line with our “Vision 2030” plan targets.

Our focus historically has been to align new sites with our SHE standards over a three-year cycle and this is the
current focus for sites acquired in the OMNOVA acquisition and the acquisition of the Adhesives Resins Business.

As of December 31, 2023, 16 of our sites have worked injury free for more than three years.

_Process Safety Performance_

Since 2015, we have recorded, rated and tracked process safety events (“PSE”) using a 4 tier scoring system
where tier 1 and 2 incidents (tier 1 being more severe) meet the definition for a “Reportable PSE” from the
International Council of Chemical Associations (“ICCA”). Performance in this area during the year ended
December 31, 2023 improved to 0.18 from 0.22 in the prior year. The decrease in our PSE rate was primarily a
result of rigorously implementing our SHE management system processes and standards and strengthening
leadership on our sites. As we continue to implement our SHE transformation initiatives across our business, we
aim to bring our process safety event rate and recordable injury rate in line with our “Vision 2030” plan targets.

_Key SHE Programs and Actions_

SHE management practices and systems are embedded throughout our business with the aim of continuously
improving SHE performance. The health and safety of our employees – alongside our impact on the environment
– remains a key priority.

Our safety, health and environment management system standards and policies include the identification and
sharing of best practice and the refreshing of Group SHE procedures linked to key areas to look to prevent major
accident hazard scenarios, most recently those of management of change and permit to work. Our longer-term
objectives include operating at <0.10 for PSER and <0.20 for RCR, which is believed to be in line with the top
quartile SHE performance for our industry.

-----

Our accident and incident management system includes trend analysis undertaken to identify common themes as
regarding incidents and system failings and we make use of wide range of root cause analysis tools for our most
significant events and near misses.

Our SHE training, communication and support includes the continued roll-out of the senior and first line
management competence assurance program; ongoing process safety training across the Group; and Global SHE
Managers’ and Site Managers’ Workshops focusing on sharing, learning and SHE leadership. To ensure our
employees and contractors understand our SHE principles and rules, we expect them to attend inductions and
refresher sessions on our 10 SHE principles and Golden Rules.

The Process Hazard Assessment (“PHA”) revalidation process is facilitated by our SHE team on a five-year
rolling cycle at our sites to assure the Executive Committee that major accident hazards are being appropriately
managed and controlled. Ensuing actions are prioritized and relayed to the Group’s capital expenditure program
for funding.

**Supply Chain Management**

Our expenditure on raw materials constituted approximately 89% of our variable costs for the year ended
December 31, 2023. We utilize a diversified supplier base of major blue-chip chemical companies and
international chemical trading houses, with our ten largest suppliers accounting for 37% of our raw material
expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2023 and no single supplier accounting for more than 5% of our
spend on raw materials. Our two largest suppliers accounted for 5% and 4%, respectively, of our raw material
expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2023. No other supplier accounted for more than 4% of our total
expenditure on raw materials for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our supplier base has widened in recent
years, as our expanded procurement team has improved security of supply and cost-effectiveness by developing
links with a wider number of raw material suppliers and also as a result of the more diverse business portfolio
resulting from our geographic and product-line expansions arising from acquired businesses.

The year ended December 31, 2023 marked the third year that we used the EcoVadis sustainability ratings
platform, providing a standardized way to assess our suppliers’ sustainability performance. There has been a
significant increase in the proportion of our procurement spend with a sustainability rating over that period, rising
to 46% in 2023, from 37% in 2022 and 26% in the 2021. In 2020, our procurement team also began engaging our
most carbon intensive suppliers so that we can work with them to increase the amount of primary data we have
access to, which is in turn expected to improve the accuracy of our Scope 3 measurements and help to identify
potential lower carbon raw materials.

Our top ten raw materials by expense collectively accounted for 59% of our raw material expenditure for the year
ended December 31, 2023. Our top five raw materials by expense are styrene, butadiene, butyl acrylate, Pygas
and Propene, which accounted for 14%, 11%, 7%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of our expenditure on raw materials
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Prices of a majority of our raw materials by cost are at least partially
dependent on crude oil prices, and while geopolitical events have recently disrupted supply chains and increased
oil prices globally, we have generally been able to pass through most of these costs, particularly in our speciality
business.

Our quality control (“QC”) procedures and laboratories ensure that we manufacture and store finished products
in a manner that assures quality. As part of our “Manufacturing Excellence” approach, each of our operational
sites has a QC department independent of production and a quality assurance manager. For every product and
every delivery, a representative sample is tested according to an inspection plan. Certificates of analysis are
provided for every delivery.

Our specialist logistics teams works on ensuring the safe and timely delivery of our products in more than
100 countries. Teams coordinate logistics from product planning through delivery, including order intake and

116


-----

preparation, loadings and pre-loading preparations at plants, warehouses and carriers, coordination of
transportation, ongoing monitoring of orders and deliveries, and management of delivery-related complaints.

In order to deliver our long-term inorganic growth agenda and to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness and
compliance of its organization, we commenced a business transformation ‘Pathway’ program. The program is
designed to deliver a consistent set of global business processes across a unified target operating model,
transforming our technology architecture into a single set of integrated systems and building additional efficiency
and effectiveness globally. The first phase of our Pathway Program was successfully deployed in May 2021, and
in the year ended December 31, 2023, we invested £9.1 million in our Pathway program. Our Pathway program
is also expected to play an increasingly important role in helping us track and report on our own emissions
progress, with new digital tools reshaping the way we manage procurement, giving us more information and
insight on a wide range of metrics from tonnage, logistics and stock levels through to future carbon performance.

**Regulatory Matters and Developments**

As global supplier of polymers and speciality chemicals we must comply with chemical safety regulations in many
of the regions in which we manufacture and sell our products. The EU, UK, US, Japan, Korea, China and Türkiye
are among many jurisdictions in which we must ensure our products comply with requirements for inventory
registration, labeling, hazard communication, and various application specific regulations such as food contact
requirements approval.  In the EU, REACH and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”)
regulate chemical products by imposing on all affected industries the responsibility for ensuring and
demonstrating the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. Compliance with EU regulations makes up
the largest portion of our product stewardship requirements, and often provides a foundation for meeting the
regulatory requirements in countries which have adopted elements of the EU REACH framework. Compliance
with the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) is required to manufacture or sell chemicals in the US, and also
has international influence. To ensure compliance with such product safety regulations globally we have a team
of specialists that are generally based in the UK, but which also has local presence in multiple EU member states,
as well as in the US, Malaysia, and China.

The REACH Regulation requires the registration of all chemicals manufactured and imported into the EU (either
alone, in mixtures or in articles) with the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). The regulation requires formal
documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as the
need for development of risk assessments, analytical data and toxicological studies for their registered uses. Most
uses of high hazard substances, such as carcinogens, will require authorization by the ECHA. REACH requires
extensive toxicological data, documentation and risk assessments for many of our chemical products and raw
materials. We have taken steps to ensure that REACH compliance is an integral part of our ongoing business and
we are committed to its REACH activities falling fully in line with the applicable guidelines. The majority of our
products fall within the exemption for polymers from the provisions on registration of Title II of REACH (Article
2(9)) (the “Polymer Exemption”) and, aside from ensuring that the individual substances contained in the mixture
are registered in their own right for the required use, most of our products therefore require little further assessment
to comply with the current REACH legislation. We review our full product portfolio to identify products that do
not meet the Polymer Exemption criteria so that appropriate action can be taken for those materials. As of
December 31, 2023, we have registered 141 substances currently required to be registered under EU REACH.
Under UK REACH, we have grandfathered 48 registrations and declared 515 substances on our DUIN. A limited
portion (approximately 2.5%) of our products contain substances classified under REACH as Substances of Very
High Concern (“SVHCs”). No products sold in the EU contain substances listed on the REACH Annex XIV
Authorization List, and we are voluntarily seeking alternatives for any use Annex XIV listed substances in our
products manufactured outside of the EU. We work closely with our customers to share appropriate safety and
handling information on all of these products to ensure their safe and compliant use.

To complement the REACH Regulation, the EU has also adopted the CLP to harmonize the EU’s system of
classifying, labelling and packaging chemical substances with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System.
The regulation standardizes communication of hazard information of chemicals and to promote regulatory
efficiency. It has established classification criteria, hazard symbols and labelling phrases, while taking account of
elements that are part of the current EU legislation. The vast majority of our products fall under the definition of
mixtures and, as such, all of our actions were completed by the appropriate deadlines. We are committed to

117


-----

achieving full compliance with the CLP requirements in close cooperation with our suppliers and customers,
including the obligation to report certain substances to the Classification and Labelling Inventory.

**Intellectual Property**

We have comprehensive current patent and trade secret coverage for both products and processes. We currently
have a significant number of patents and pending patent applications, of which the majority are related to products
and their application with some additional patents covering process technology. Our patent portfolio includes
patent families in many different jurisdictions. We also own trademarks in all of the jurisdictions where we believe
such registration is necessary to maintain our brand and goodwill, and we own web domains matching our house
trademark and company profile. Our policy is to protect our proprietary technologies by either seeking patent
protection or keeping the know-how as a trade secret. Where needed, we defend and enforce our intellectual
property rights or have appropriate contracts in place to control our intellectual property rights. We had over 116
active patent families of which 3 filings were made in the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31,
2023, we had over 644 patents and also owned more than 1,420 trademarks distributed over 146 trademark
families. In order to protect confidential technical information which is not subject to patent protection, we rely
on trade secret law and frequently enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and partners.

In addition to our own patents, patent applications, proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are party to certain
licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology
and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities.

While we believe that our intellectual property provides competitive advantages, as a result of the breadth and
nature of our intellectual property rights and business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right
(other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain applicable registrations) is material to our current
business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over
the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

We are not aware of any threatened, proposed or actual proceedings that have or will be brought against us for
infringement of third-party rights or any infringement of our rights by third parties that, if successfully prosecuted,
would have a material and adverse effect upon its business.

**Employees**

The following table details the average number of full-time equivalent for the years ended December 31, 2021,
2022 and 2023:

**Year Ended December 31,** **2021** **2022** **2023**
Average number of full time employees ................................................. 4,614 5,202 4,738

Over the years, we have enjoyed a positive working relationship with our labor force and unions, and we are
committed to maintaining these relationships going forward. Approximately 55% of our non-management
employees are covered by some form of collective bargaining arrangement at site or national level or a works
council agreement. In such plants, we work with trade unions in line with that country’s laws and regulations.

We are mindful of financial pressures facing our colleagues across our business as high inflation has driven up
the cost of food and energy in many regions where we operate. Our approach has been guided by balancing the
financial pressures facing the business with those of our employees, and we have worked to develop equitable,
bespoke and tailored approaches for each of the geographies we operate in. For example, in 2022, we made oneoff payments to certain groups of employees; elsewhere we paid local increases. Other initiatives to support
employees in 2022 included food vouchers and discounted and subsidized shopping.

**Insurance**

Our management believes that our current insurance coverage is appropriate for our business, in respect of the
amount and applicable excesses and deductibles, considering our business locations as well as the size and scope
of our business activities.

118


-----

**Legal and Regulatory Proceedings**

From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, disputes with customers, suppliers or employees, as well
as investigations, arbitrations and other proceedings (including administrative proceedings), which are handled in
the ordinary course of business.

- Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting, financial reporting procedures and the quality
of the external audit.

- Reviewing and challenging significant financial estimates and judgements.

- Supporting the Board in considering whether the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable.

**Internal Control and Risk Management**

The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s systems of risk management and internal control and for
reviewing their effectiveness and sets appropriate policies to ensure that the UK Corporate Governance Code
requirements are met. The systems of risk management and internal control deployed within the Group are
designed to reduce the risks of failure to meet business objectives, but these risks cannot be eliminated. The risk
management and internal control systems adopted can therefore only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
about meeting such business objectives or against material misstatement or loss. The Group risk management
framework is set out on pages 162-169 of the 2023 Annual Report. In 2022, the Board established a new Executive
Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and responsible for (i) conducting top-down risk
assessments and reviews; (ii) maintaining an overview of the key risks identified across the Group and assessing
the adequacy of risk responses; and (iii) assessing and reporting on principal and emerging risks to the Audit
Committee and Board.

The Group’s internal controls over the financial reporting and consolidation processes are designed under the
supervision of the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of the Group’s published financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.

The processes which are used by the Board either directly or, where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to
review the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting
process and the process for preparing consolidated accounts include the following:

- Review of the external and internal audit work plans.

- Consideration of reports from management and external parties, including the internal and external
auditors, on the system of internal financial control and any material control weaknesses.

- Discussion with management of the actions taken on any possible problem areas for the business that are
identified.

- Receiving copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee meetings.

- Receiving regular written and oral reports from management on all aspects of production, operations,
financial and risk management matters.

**_Interest Rates and Fees_**

Interest is payable on loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at a relevant benchmark rate plus the applicable

transaction.

**_Financial Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as amended by the 2024 RCF Amendment) requires that the Issuer and
its consolidated subsidiaries maintain a certain level of Gearing Ratio.

The Gearing Ratio is tested half-yearly, at the end of each financial year of the Issuer and financial half-year of
the Issuer, in each case in respect of the immediately preceding 12-month period (the “Test Dates”).

The covenant level for the Gearing Ratio shall not exceed: (i) 6.00x as of June 30, 2024; (ii) 5.75x as of December

not reach agreement on whether and how to continue with the Revolving Credit Facility (such
prepayment and cancellation to occur on the tenth day after the last day of such 30-day negotiation

Notes due 2025 under an indenture dated June 25, 2020, among, inter alios, the Issuer and Citibank, N.A., London
Branch, as trustee (the “Existing Notes Indenture”).

131


-----

**_Guarantee_**

The Existing Notes are senior guaranteed obligations of the Issuer. The Existing Notes are guaranteed on a senior
basis by the Issuer, Synthomer (UK) Limited, Synthomer Trading Limited, Synthomer Holdings Limited,
Synthomer Deutschland GmbH, Synthomer S.r.l., Synthomer Specialty Resins S.r.l., Synthomer Inc. and
Synthomer Sdn Bhd, subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable law.

**_Ranking_**

The Existing Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with any of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations
that are not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Notes, including indebtedness
under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, and will rank senior in right of payment
to any existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment. The Existing Notes will be
effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s existing and future secured obligations, to the extent of the value
of such property and assets securing such debt, unless such property or assets also secure the Existing Notes, as
applicable, on an equal and ratable or senior basis. The Existing Notes will be structurally subordinated to all
existing and future obligations of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Existing Notes.

**_Interest Rates, Payment Dates and Maturity_**

The Existing Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum. Interest on the Existing Notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The first interest payment date was January 1, 2021.
The Existing Notes will mature on July 1, 2025.

**_Optional Redemption of the Existing Notes_**

At any time prior to July 1, 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of Existing Notes that were initially issued under the Existing Notes Indenture (calculated after
giving effect to the issuance of any additional notes) at a redemption price of 103.875% of their principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, with the net
proceeds from one or more equity offerings. The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes that were initially issued
(calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any additional notes) would remain outstanding
immediately after the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such equity offering.

At any time prior to July 1, 2022, the Issuer may also redeem all or part of the Existing Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date.

At any time on or after July 1, 2022 and prior to maturity, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Existing Notes
at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12month period beginning on July 1, in each of the years set forth below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2022 ...................................................................................................................... 101.93750%

such Existing Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and certain additional amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase.

Existing Notes Indenture contains events of default that are also substantially similar to those set out in
“Description of the Notes.”

**_Listing_**

The Existing Notes are listed on the London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market.

**_Governing Law_**

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

In this “Description of the Notes,” the term “Issuer” refers only to Synthomer plc and not to any of its Subsidiaries
(as defined hereafter), except for the purposes of financial data determined on a consolidated basis. The term
“Notes,” unless the context requires otherwise, also refers to “Book-Entry Interests” in the Notes, as defined
herein. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth throughout the text or under
“—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuer will issue €350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”)
under an indenture dated on or about       , 2024 (the “Indenture”) among, _inter alios, the Issuer, the_
Guarantors and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as trustee (the “Trustee”), in private transactions that are not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The
terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €350,000,000 aggregate principal amount
of Notes (the “Initial Notes”) will be issued in this Offering. We may in the future, subject to applicable law,
issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes (as defined below). We will only be permitted to issue
Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional
Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the
Indenture.

On the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Notes will be used, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i)
repurchase or redeem certain of the Existing Notes and (ii) pay certain costs, expenses and fees related to the
Transactions.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Notes and the Indenture. It does not, however,
restate the Notes and the Indenture in their entirety and where reference is made to a particular provision of the
Notes or the Indenture, such reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by
reference to all of the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. You should read the Notes and the Indenture
because they contain additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as a
Holder of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture may be obtained from the Issuer at the address indicated under
“Listing and General Information.” The Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by
reference to, and is not otherwise subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including
Section 316(b) thereof.

Application will be made to admit the Notes to trading on the International Securities Market (the “ISM”) of the
London Stock Exchange. In the event the Notes are admitted to trading on an exchange other than the ISM,
references herein to the ISM shall be deemed to be to the relevant exchange upon which the Notes are listed. The
Issuer can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted. See “—Payments on the Notes; Paying
_Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar.”_

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

Each reference to a legal entity herein shall be deemed to include such entity’s successor in interest, unless the
context requires otherwise.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

(a) be the Issuer’s general senior unsecured obligations;

(b) mature on         , 2029;

134


-----

(c) rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future unsecured_
obligations that are not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes,
including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility, the UKEF Facilities and the Existing Notes;

(d) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(e) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer, to the
extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless such property
or assets also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or senior basis;

(f) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that do not provide Guarantees; and

(g) be guaranteed on the Issue Date on a senior basis by the Guarantors.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date.

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, each Guarantee will:

(a) be a senior obligation of the Guarantor that granted such Guarantee;

(b) rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future unsecured
obligations that are not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantee, including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility, the UKEF Facilities and the
Existing Notes;

(c) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

(d) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of such Guarantor, to
the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing such obligations, unless such
property or assets also secure such Guarantee on an equal and ratable or senior basis; and

(e) be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that do not provide Guarantees.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee
being voidable or unenforceable or causing any personal liability of the Guarantor’s management under applicable
laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees— Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limit_
_validity and enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees —The insolvency_
_laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as those of another_
_jurisdiction with which you may be familiar” and “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.” Each_
Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any other
Guarantor. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt.”

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantors also guarantee the obligations
under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, in each case, on a senior basis.

135


-----

**_General_**

Not all of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer is a Holding Company
for the operating companies in the Group and is accordingly dependent on cash flows from its Subsidiaries to
meet its obligations under the Notes.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Guarantors generated 65.2% of our EBITDA. As of December 31,
2023, the total borrowings of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries were nil (excluding intercompany borrowings).

The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any right of
the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the
consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that
Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary subject
to any mandatory legal subordination, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinated in right
of payment to any security over the assets of the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary senior to that held by
the Issuer.

As of the Issue Date, subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, all of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate_
certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject
to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee
the Notes.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial. The Indenture
will permit additional Debt to be secured.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on       , 2029 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The redemption
price at maturity will be 100.0% of the principal amount. The Issuer will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of €350,000,000. Each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum of    % and interest will be payable
semi-annually on      and      of each year, commencing on      , 2024. Interest will be payable to
Holders of record on each Note in respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the Clearing System
Business Day immediately preceding the payment date, as the case may be; however, owners of beneficial
interests in the Notes must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore_
_prospective investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and_
_remedies.” If the due date for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day at the place where such_
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of such delay. The rights of Holders in beneficial interest of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from, and including, the original issuance date or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

   - each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue

136


-----

Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

   - each series of Notes sold to non-US persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under
the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will initially be represented by one of more global notes in
registered form without coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A
Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of such common depository for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests
and transfers thereof will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized
below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance
with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors
or an Officer of the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes payable
in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

137


-----

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be redeemed in

part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to

such Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of

Control Offer (as defined under “—Certain Covenants —Change of Control”) or an Asset Sale (as
defined under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”).

The Issuer, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder
as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, at its office
or through its agent in London, England that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that agent will be
Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the “Paying Agent”). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent without prior
notice to the Holders. The Issuer will make all payments in same-day funds.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer
Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be left at the
registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the Registrar and
the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as they are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and
regulations of the ISM so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long
as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on
behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of
the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental
charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is
permitted to issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”), which shall have the terms set out in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee. The Notes (together with any Additional Notes issued from time to time) will
constitute separate series of Notes, but will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the
purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP, ISIN or
Common Code, as applicable, as any series of existing Notes unless such Additional Notes are fungible with such
series of existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned
Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pertaining to (a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole
or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any special mandatory redemption in the event that the release
from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on
the consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a “Special
_Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or a portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the_
granting of Liens described in clause (z) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security
agent solely for the benefit of the holders of such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the
benefit of the holders of any other Notes, including Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together
with all necessary authorizations for the Trustee or such security agent to enter into such arrangements; provided
that, for so long as the proceeds of such Additional Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only

138


-----

from such Liens and shall not be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and shall not benefit from any security interest in the Collateral and (c) the maturity date, interest rate (which may
be fixed or floating), interest payment dates and related record dates, currency, clearing system and denominations
for such Additional Notes, it being understood that, with respect to the Additional Notes, all references to currency
(including any government obligations related thereto) and denominations herein shall mean the currencies
(including any government obligations related thereto) and denominations applicable to such Additional Notes.
In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such Additional Notes are issued
bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the
consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional Notes bearing
a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Notes bearing
the same CUSIP, ISIN or Common Code as any existing Notes issued; provided that such Additional Notes are
fungible with the Notes issued on the relevant issue date for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes”
shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional
Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects
to such other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with other series (including, if applicable, the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date) (it being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in
all material respects to any other series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall
be deemed to be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions
relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

As of the Issue Date, subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be
unconditionally, jointly and severally, guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. Under the Indenture, the
Guarantors will jointly and severally agree to guarantee the due and punctual payment of all amounts payable
under the Notes, including principal, premium and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, and interest
payable under the Notes. In the future, under certain circumstances, certain other Subsidiaries may guarantee the
Notes.

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or another
Subsidiary of the Issuer. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled
to contribution from any other Guarantor. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited
to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without
resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable or causing any personal liability
of the Guarantor’s management under applicable laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer,
fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. By virtue of
this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. For a description of
such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees— Each
_Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain limitations or defenses that may limit validity and enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Notes and the Guarantees —The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Italy, Germany and Malaysia may not_
_be as favorable to you as those of another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar” and “Certain Insolvency_
_and Enforceability Considerations.” Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee_
will be entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
_of Debt.”_

Subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantors also guarantee the obligations
under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities, in each case, on a senior basis.

See “Description of Other Debt—Revolving Credit Facilities—Guarantees and Guarantor Coverage Test” and
_Description of Other Debt—UKEF Facilities—Guarantees and Guarantor Coverage Test” for a description of_
the guarantor coverage test contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the UKEF Facilities

139


-----

Agreement, respectively, as of the Issue Date and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt” for
a description of the limitation on Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors in the Indenture on guaranteeing
Debt without providing a Guarantee of the Notes.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be discharged
and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination)

or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of the Guarantor
(or a Holding Company thereof) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction)
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenants described
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;_

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of the Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any

Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a Holding
Company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no
longer qualifies as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(3) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions under “—

_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(4) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an Unrestricted

Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred

and is continuing;

(6) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(7) the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant

to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,” the
release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to
guarantee the Notes; or

(9) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee shall execute, subject
to the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, any documents reasonably requested by the Issuer in
order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. Neither the Issuer
nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such Guarantee or any such
release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**_Limitations on the value of the Guarantees_**

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations under its Guarantee
being voidable or unenforceable or causing any personal liability of the Guarantor’s management under applicable
laws relating to maintenance of share capital, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit,
financial assistance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and applicable to the Guarantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have

140


-----

effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
_Guarantees—Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defences that may limit validity and enforceability,” “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may_
_prove difficult,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees —The insolvency laws of England_
_and Wales, Italy, Germany, and Malaysia may not be as favorable to you as those of another jurisdiction with_
_which you may be familiar” and “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”_

**_Additional Amounts_**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or
similar governmental charges of whatever nature (collectively, “Taxes”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of the
United Kingdom or any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in business or
resident for tax purposes, or from or through which payment on the Notes or the Guarantees is made, or any
political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, having the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction”), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. In the event that the Issuer
or a Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts
(“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder of the Notes after
such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that such Holder would have received if such
Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a Holder of
any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of a present or former

connection of the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership or corporation) (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is
reasonably identifiable) with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, citizenship,
nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a place of business or
a place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than the
mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case

of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) of any Note, to comply
with the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder, providing at least 30 calendar days’ notice, to satisfy
any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements concerning nationality,
residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which the Holder or such beneficial
owner is legally required and able to satisfy, whether imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction, provided that the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to satisfy such
requirements);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is not payable by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to any

Note or Guarantee;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is required in

order to receive payment) by the Holder for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
such payment becomes due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever

141


-----

occurs later, except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on
presenting the same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period;

(f) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471–1474 of the

U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (or any amended or successor version of such
sections that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the
foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(g) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor to the Holder or

beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably
identifiable) if such Holder or beneficial owner is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment
had the beneficial owner been the Holder of the Note.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect of any
combination of the above items.

The Issuer or Guarantors will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and remit
the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all applicable
laws. The Issuer will, upon request, make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s reasonable efforts
to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such
payment by the Issuer.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment
under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or
Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to
enable the Trustee or Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

In addition, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer,
documentation, court, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest or penalties with respect
thereto imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in respect of the execution, issue, delivery or
registration of the Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other document or instrument referred to
thereunder (other than transfers of the Notes following the initial resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers);
and (ii) any such similar taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a result of, or in
connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, Guarantees or any other such document or instrument following
the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
_mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person to the_
Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or
any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
principal (and premiums, if any), redemption price, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to
any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts thereon.

142


-----

**Optional Redemption**

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering,
the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the Notes, the incurrence of
indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption or notice
is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion,
the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, provided,
_however, that, in any case such redemption date shall not be more than 60 days from the date on which such notice_
to holders of the Notes is first given, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption
date so delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture or the Notes, redemption notices may
be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of
the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

In the case of any partial redemption, unless otherwise required by law, the Notes to be redeemed will be selected
in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed,
and in compliance with the applicable procedures and requirements of the relevant clearing system(s), or, if the
Notes are not listed, and the relevant clearing system(s) have no such procedures or requirements, then on a pro
rata basis, although no Note of €100,000 in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part, and only
Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. The Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar shall not be liable
for any selection made under this paragraph. If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the
notice of redemption relating to that Definitive Registered Note will state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. A new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof will be issued and delivered in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive
Registered Note.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such redemption or notice may, at
the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest payment record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business
Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on such redemption date
if it were a Business Day for the intervening period.

The Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Subject to the applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system(s), the Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to
one or more of the relevant provisions of the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with
respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made
pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates.

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included in an
Officer’s Certificate), the Paying Agent will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the
redemption date; provided that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer
of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). The payment to each Holder
will equal the amount such Holder would have been entitled to receive on the relevant redemption date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will
not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.
To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a clearing system, any payment to the

143


-----

beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system. Neither the Trustee, Paying Agent nor other applicable party shall be required
to incur any costs, fees or expenses (except as expressly agreed in writing) in relation to such distribution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer or Excess Proceeds Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer,
and accordingly the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice to Holders of the Notes, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to
redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase with consideration
equal or equivalent to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee)
in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2026 upon Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to, 2026, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes,
the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that
were initially issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes)
at a redemption price of % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), with the net proceeds from one or more Equity
Offerings. The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued (calculated after giving

effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) would remain outstanding immediately after the proposed
redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2026_**

At any time prior to, 2026, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may also
redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the

**_Optional Redemption on or after_** **_, 2026_**

At any time on or after, 2026 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be at the following redemption

144


-----

together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date and all Additional Amounts, if
any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
the Issuer determines in good faith that the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next date on which any amount
would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts (as defined above under
“—Guarantees—Additional Amounts”) in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees pursuant to the terms and
conditions thereof, which the Issuer or Guarantor cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it
(including making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction and, in the case of a Guarantor,
making the payment giving rise to such requirement through another Guarantor who would not be obligated to
pay Additional Amounts if payments through another Guarantor would be reasonable), as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)

of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under “—Guarantees—Additional Amounts”)
affecting taxation which is enacted or issued and becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture or, if
the jurisdiction imposing such tax became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Indenture, on
or after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under
the Indenture; or

(b) any introduction of or change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties,

regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction) on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the jurisdiction imposing such tax became
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which such Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (each of the foregoing clauses
(a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or
withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, sending of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement

of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have been satisfied
(including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or Guarantor
taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing

Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case
may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept, and is entitled to rely on, such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence,
without further enquiry, of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will
be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor person_
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Notice of Optional Redemption_**

For so long as any series of Notes is admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so
require, any notice of redemption to the Holders shall be published to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the ISM of any change in the principal
amount of Notes outstanding. In addition to such publication, and to the extent and in the manner so required by
the rules of the ISM, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will send such
notice to Holders, except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. For

145


-----

any series of Notes which are represented by Global Notes, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant
notices to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account Holders. The Notes will be selected
in accordance with the methods described under “—Optional Redemption—General.”

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as
described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Asset Sales.”_

The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open
market or otherwise, at such price and on such terms as it sees fit. Subject to any applicable limitations contained
in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the UKEF
Facilities Agreement, any purchases made by the Issuer may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or
the incurrence of new debt. The amounts involved in such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate,
may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of
debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee

or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become responsible for,

“Incurrence”), any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); _provided, that the Issuer and any Restricted_
Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if on the date on which such additional
Debt is Incurred the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Applicable Testing Period prior to the date of
determination, and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds
thereof, on a pro forma basis, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and

Issuer or a Guarantor, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior

(e)


payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the
performance in full of its obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a disposition,

pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any transaction pursuant to which
any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing from the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary
ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case, be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt
not permitted by this clause (d);

(i)  without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,” the guarantee

by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt that was permitted to be incurred by another
provision of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant; _provided that if the Debt being guaranteed is_
subordinated to the Notes or is unsecured, then the guarantee shall be subordinated or unsecured to
the same extent as the Debt guaranteed; or

(ii) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Debt arising by reason of

handling equipment), in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or any
part of the purchase price, lease expense or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement

Subsidiary’s business (including any reasonable related fees or expenses Incurred in connection
with such acquisition, lease, rental or development); _provided that the principal amount of such_
Debt so Incurred outside the ordinary course of business, when aggregated with such other Debt

EBITDA; and

limitation, shares of Capital Stock, other than guarantees or similar credit support given by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such assets for
the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the maximum aggregate liability in respect of
all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (g) will at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including
non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received from the sale of such
assets;

(h) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Hedging Agreements entered

Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect thereto;

(s) Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary relating to any VAT liabilities or deferral of PAYE taxes

with the agreement of, or pursuant to rules or guidance of, the U.K. HM Revenue and Customs (including

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, in the event that an item

of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses

148


-----

(a) through (v) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
“Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Debt on the date of its
Incurrence in any manner that complies with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant. Debt Incurred under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the UKEF Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been
Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of paragraph (2) above and may not
be reclassified as Debt Incurred under paragraph (1) above. In addition, from time to time any item of Debt
initially classified as Incurred pursuant to one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (b)
through (v) of paragraph (2) above, or entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on
_Debt” covenant, may later be reclassified by the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred_
pursuant to such new clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant to the
extent that such reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such new clause of paragraph (2) or
paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant at the time of such reclassification. Debt permitted by
this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Debt but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting
such Debt.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt denominated in a

given currency (the “Relevant Currency”) where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of
such Debt will be the Currency Equivalent determined on the date of such determination, the date on which
such Debt was initially incurred or such other date or period used in any relevant financial statements or
management accounts; provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a
Currency Agreement (with respect to the Relevant Currency) covering principal amounts payable on such
Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in the Relevant Currency will be adjusted to take into account the
effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any Debt that refinances any other Debt (including any
Permitted Refinancing Debt) Incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the Currency
Equivalent of the Debt being refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced was initially
Incurred or such other date or period used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, for purposes of determining
compliance with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur under this “Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(5) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “Limitation on Debt” covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees, Liens, bankers’ acceptance or other similar

instrument or obligation, in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination of such
particular amount will not be included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the “Limitation on Liens”

covenant will not be treated as Debt;

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount or of

accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest or dividends in the
form of additional Debt, will not, in any case, be treated as Debt; and

(d) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Debt incurred to refinance

Debt initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence (such permission, a “Grower
Permission”), if such refinancing would cause such Grower Permission to be exceeded if calculated based
on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such Grower Permission
shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not
exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

149

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, take any of the

following actions (each of which is a “Restricted Payment” and which are collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”):

(a) declare or pay any dividend on or make any distribution (whether made in cash, securities or other

property) with respect to any of the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including,

combination involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted

Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire such shares of Qualified Capital Stock or in
Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(b) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection

with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination), directly or indirectly, any shares

shares of Capital Stock;

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value,

prior to any scheduled principal payment, sinking fund payment or Stated Maturity, any Subordinated
Debt (other than (i) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition
or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or final
maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (ii) intercompany Debt between the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary or among Restricted Subsidiaries);

(d) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem,

defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than any
payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Debt); or

(e) make any Restricted Investment in any Person.

If any Restricted Payment described above is not made in cash, the amount of the proposed Restricted
Payment will be the Fair Market Value of the asset to be transferred as at the date of transfer.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make a Restricted Payment

if, at the time of and after giving pro forma effect to such proposed Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

the first day of the fiscal half commencing immediately prior to the Original Issue Date and ending
on the last day of the Issuer’s last fiscal half ending prior to the date of such Applicable Reporting
Date (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income shall be a negative number, minus
100% of such negative amount); plus

(ii) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable

securities received by the Issuer after the Original Issue Date as equity capital contributions or from
the issuance or sale (other than to any Subsidiary) of shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock

shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock (except, in each case to the extent such proceeds are

150

used to purchase, redeem or otherwise retire Capital Stock or Subordinated Debt as set forth in
clauses (d) or (e) of paragraph (3) below) (excluding (x) any Contribution Amounts and (y) the Net
Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received
from the issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds
borrowed from the Issuer or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(iii) (x) the amount by which the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the

Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet after the Original Issue Date upon the conversion or exchange
(other than by a Subsidiary) of such Debt into the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock and (y) the
aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable
securities received after the Original Issue Date by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than

for cash or Cash Equivalents, together with, in the case of both clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate
Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received
by the Issuer at the time of such conversion or exchange (excluding the Net Cash Proceeds from the
issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds
borrowed from the Issuer or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(iv) (x) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any Restricted Investment,

Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, less the cost of the disposition of such Investment and net of
taxes, (y) if such Investment constituted a guarantee, an amount equal to the amount of such
guarantee upon the full and unconditional release of such guarantee and (z) in the case of the
designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or merger of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary into a Restricted Subsidiary (as long as the designation of such Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s
interest in such Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as (or merges with)
a Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(v) in the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes any Investment in a Person that, as a

result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal
to the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s existing interest in such
Person that was previously treated as a Restricted Payment at the time such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may take the

following actions; provided that solely with respect to clauses (n), (o) and (r) below, no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing:

(a) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 90 days after the date of its

declaration or giving of notice of redemption, as applicable, if at such date of its declaration or giving of
notice of redemption, as applicable, such payment would have been permitted by the provisions of this
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant;

benefit of, any current or former officer, director, consultant, customer or employee of the Issuer or any

Stock may not exceed an amount (net of repayments of any such loans or advances) equal to:

of the Net Cash Proceeds of the Incurrence (other than to a Subsidiary) of, Permitted Refinancing Debt;

(g) the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution to holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted

Subsidiary on a pro rata basis or on a basis that results in the receipt by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of dividends or distributions of greater value than the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
would receive on a pro rata basis;

(h) the repurchase of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options with respect to which

payment of the cash exercise price has been forgiven if the cumulative aggregate value of such deemed
repurchases does not exceed the cumulative aggregate amount of the exercise price of such options

(i) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of Redeemable Capital Stock

issued in accordance with the “Limitation on Debt” covenant;

(j) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of Capital Stock deemed

to occur upon the exercise of stock options, warrants or other securities, if such Capital Stock represents
a portion of the exercise price of such options, warrants or other securities;

152


-----

(k) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated

Debt of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to provisions similar to those described
under “—Change of Control;” provided that all Notes validly tendered by Holders in connection with a
Change of Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value, as applicable;

(l) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or any

Restricted Subsidiary with any Excess Proceeds remaining after consummation of an Excess Proceeds
Offer pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Asset Sales;”

(m) Permitted Parent Payments;

(n) any other Restricted Payment; provided that the total aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made

under this clause (n) does not exceed the greater of £100.0 million or 40.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

3.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;

(p) payments pursuant to any Tax Sharing Agreement or arrangement among the Issuer and its Subsidiaries

and other Persons with which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a
consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a part of a group
for tax purposes; provided, however, that such payments will not exceed the amount of tax that the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries would owe on a standalone basis and the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries are relieved by the payment of such amounts to a relevant taxing authority;

(q) the distribution, as a dividend or otherwise, of shares of Capital Stock of, or Debt owed to, the Issuer or

a Restricted Subsidiary by Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(r) the declaration and payment by the Issuer of, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent

to pay, dividends on the common stock or common equity interests of the Issuer or any Parent, in an
amount not to exceed in any fiscal year the greater of (a) 6% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the
Issuer from any Public Offering or contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Redeemable Capital Stock or Preferred Stock) of the Issuer or loaned as Subordinated Shareholder Debt
to the Issuer, in each case after the Issue Date and (b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) the greater of
(A) 7% of the Market Capitalization and (B) 7% of the Issue Date Market Capitalization; and

(s) payment of any Receivables Fees and purchases of receivables and other assets pursuant to a Receivables

Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing.

(4) The actions described in clauses (a) and (n) of paragraph (3) above are Restricted Payments that will be

permitted to be made in accordance with paragraph (3) but that will reduce the amount that would otherwise
be available for Restricted Payments under clause (c) of paragraph (2) above.

(5) In the event an item meets the criteria of more than one category of Permitted Investment and/or Restricted

Payment, as applicable, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may classify any Permitted Investment or other
Restricted Payment as being made in part under one of the clauses or sub-clauses of this covenant (or, in the
case of any Permitted Investment, the clauses or sub-clauses of Permitted Investments) and in part under one
or more other such clauses or sub-clauses.

(6) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in the Indenture, in no event shall the Issuer or any

Restricted Subsidiary be permitted to dispose of, or grant an exclusive license to, any Material Intellectual
Property, whether as an Asset Disposition, Investment, dividend or otherwise, to any Unrestricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer

to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase,
exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate
of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater than the greater of £15.0 million and

153


-----

6.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, unless such transaction or series of transactions is entered into in good faith
and:

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less

favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could have been
obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) with a
Person that is not an Affiliate; and

(b) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments or the

transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than the greater of £30.0
million and 12.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, shall resolve that such transaction complies with clause
(a) above and that the fairness of such transaction has been approved by a majority of the Disinterested
Members, if any, of the Board of Directors.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(a) reasonable directors’ fees, indemnities and similar arrangements (including the payment of directors’ and

officers’ insurance premiums), consulting and advisory fees, employee compensation, employee and
director bonuses, directorship, employment or consulting agreements and arrangements, collective
bargaining agreements, employee benefit arrangements, including vacation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or other similar plans, programs or arrangements or legal
fees payable to any current or former employee, officer or director as long as the Issuer’s Board of
Directors has approved the terms thereof and deemed the services performed or thereafter to be
performed for amounts to be fair consideration therefor;

(b) Permitted Investments (other than pursuant to clause (c)(iii), (q) or (u) of the definition thereof) and any

Restricted Payment not prohibited by the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant;

(c) any Management Advances or Permitted Parent Payments and any waiver or transaction with respect

thereto;

(d) agreements, instruments and arrangements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment, extension,

renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement thereto and any payments or transaction in relation
thereto; provided that any such amendment, extension, renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement
to the terms thereof is not more disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), taken as a
whole, to the Holders of the Notes and to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any
material respect than the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(e) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar transfers

pursuant to, or for the purpose of the funding of, directorship, employment or consulting arrangements,
stock options, stock ownership plans and other similar arrangements, as long as the terms thereof are or
have been previously approved by the Issuer’s Board of Directors;

(f) the granting and performance of registration rights for the Issuer’s securities;

(g) transactions between or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or between or among Restricted

Subsidiaries;

(h) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Issuer or options, warrants

or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock);

(i) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations

under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreement relating thereto) to which it is a party as at the Issue Date and any similar agreements which
it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of, obligations under any future amendment to any such existing
agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by
this clause (i) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise

154


-----

disadvantageous in any material respect (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to the Holders of the
Notes when taken as a whole;

(j) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary solely (x) because

the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock in such Person (including, without limitation,
any such Person that is a Captive Insurance Company), (y) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
has the right to designate one or more members of the Board of Directors or similar governing body of
such Person, or (z) as a result of both such ownership of Capital Stock and such right to so designate;

(k) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case

in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary or are on terms materially no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(l) the execution of, delivery of and performance under any Tax Sharing Agreement; and

(m) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or permit

to exist any Lien on any of its property or assets, whether owned on the date of the Indenture or thereafter
acquired, securing any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (the “Initial Lien”), unless (i) such
Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Notes
and the Indenture or, in respect of Liens on property or assets of any Guarantor, such Guarantee thereof,
equally and ratably with (or, in the case of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor on a senior basis
to) such Debt for so long as such Debt is so secured by such Initial Lien.

(2) Any such Lien created as a result of this covenant “Limitation on Liens” in favor of the Notes or any such

Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge
of the Initial Lien to which it relates.

(3) With respect to any Lien securing Debt that was permitted to secure such Debt at the time of the Incurrence

of such Debt, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Debt. The “Increased
Amount” of any Debt shall mean any increase in the amount of such Debt in connection with any accrual of
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest
in the form of additional Debt with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Debt outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Debt.

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each

Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal amount of €100,000 or
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”)
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”).

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer,

with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing in the security
register on such date, which notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a business

day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent, or such later date as

155


-----

is necessary to comply with any requirements under the Exchange Act or any other applicable securities
laws or regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest

after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on
such date;

(e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to

withdraw such acceptance.

(3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount

of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee will promptly
authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes
surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of certificated Notes; provided
that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the

Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under “Optional
Redemption” or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the
manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal
to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such tender
offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than €100,000 in original principal amount of such Note
would remain outstanding following such purchase.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities
laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply
with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations
under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global
Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could (i) lead to a mandatory
prepayment and cancellation of all amounts and facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or
the UKEF Facilities Agreement and (ii) require the Issuer to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes to
repurchase the Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. The
Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur,
would require such debt to be repurchased. In addition, the exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to
require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the UKEF Facilities Agreement or the indenture governing the Existing Notes and any such
future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the
Guarantors of such repurchase. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would
necessarily result in a Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes.
The provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event
of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely

156


-----

affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such
transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those
described under “—Limitation on Debt.” The existence, however, of a Holder of the Notes’ right to require the
Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of Control.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available
funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders
of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of
any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled
maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite
consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change
of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase
Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the
Holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default.” An Event of Default under the Indenture,
unless waived, would result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under
“Description of Other Debt,” including under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the UKEF Facilities
Agreement and the indenture governing the Existing Notes.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers” below.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(a) the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,

any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in good faith by the Issuer,
and the Issuer’s determination (including the Board of Directors’ determination, as applicable) will be
conclusive (as to the value of any and all non-cash consideration));

(b) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such

Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 180 days of such

Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash or Cash

Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Sale);

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (other

than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary
is released from any guarantee of such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

157


-----

(v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

in such Asset Sale; provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such Designated Non-cash
Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time of receipt of all other
Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (v), less the amount of Net Cash
Proceeds previously realized in cash from prior Designated Non-cash Consideration does not exceed
(with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at
the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of £50.0
million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA; or

(vi) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (v); and

(c) the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such Asset Sale complies with

the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset

Sale, within 540 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or any such
Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net Cash Proceeds
are so used within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 540 day period), may be used by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) to prepay, redeem, repay or purchase any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not

Subordinated Debt (including the Notes) or (in the case of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments constituting Debt that is not Subordinated Debt) cash collateralize any such Debt (in
each case other than Debt owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and, if the Debt prepaid,
redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Debt, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto
(except that no such reduction will be required to the extent that such Debt would, immediately after
giving effect to such prepayment, repayment, repurchase or redemption, have been capable of being
reincurred under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Debt”);_

(b) to invest in any Replacement Assets or make capital expenditures (including by means of capital

expenditure by, or an investment in Replacement Assets by, a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount
equal to some or all of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary);
or

(c) do any combination of the foregoing.

(d) The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds actually received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary but

not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes “Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application
of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £35.0 million and 14.0% of

Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will, within 30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an “Excess
Proceeds Offer”) from all Holders of Notes and, at the Issuer’s election, from the holders of any Pari Passu
Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount,
in the case of the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the
Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an
amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note being repurchased
and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value,
as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt being redeemed or repurchased, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant
to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use the
amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt for any purposes that are

158


-----

not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based
upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt
tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari Passu

Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from
the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such Holders, or such later date as may be required
under the Exchange Act.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise use the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender
offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirements of any
applicable securities exchange on which Notes are then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, the
Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in this “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to

guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt outstanding under any
Credit Facility Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Debt” or any
other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless such Restricted Subsidiary
either (i) is not a Significant Subsidiary and, in respect of any Debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility or the UKEF Facilities (as may be refinanced, amended or restated from time to time) only, has not
become a Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the UKEF Facilities Agreement,
_provided that any such Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary also would not, in the_
aggregate when taken together with other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries,
constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single person or (ii) executes and delivers within 30 days
a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such
Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such other Debt; and with respect to any guarantee
of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to such
Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated
Debt is subordinated to the Notes. Any Guarantee of payment of the Notes may contain limitations on
Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to recognize
certain defences generally available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law or regulation.

(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary

existing on the Issue Date or that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the
guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary.

(3) Any Guarantee of the Notes granted pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this

covenant may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances described under the heading “—Guarantees—Release
_of the_ _Guarantees.” A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at_
the date of such release there is no Debt of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release
if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. At the cost and reasonable request of
the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all necessary actions to effectuate any release of any Guarantee of the Notes
in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

159


-----

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to

guarantee the Notes to the extent such Guarantee would reasonably be expected (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer) to give rise to or result in (a) any conflict with or violation of applicable law, rule, regulation
or order; (b) any risk of liability (civil, criminal, administrative or other) for the officers, directors,
shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable guarantee or similar fee payable to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable expenses and other than reasonable governmental
expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any
measures pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise

cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock

or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (ii) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case,
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the “Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted

_Subsidiaries” covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:_

guarantee thereof in accordance with the “Limitation on Debt” covenant or pursuant to paragraph (2) of
such “Limitation on Debt” covenant; provided that in the case of any such encumbrances or restrictions
imposed under any Credit Facilities, such encumbrances or restrictions taken as a whole are not
materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than those imposed by the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement or the UKEF Facilities Agreement as at the Issue Date (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer);

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument in effect on the Issue Date;

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances and

so acquired;

-----

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets permitted by the

“Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant with respect to the assets or Capital Stock to be sold pursuant to

prohibited from being Incurred after the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Debt:” (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); or
(ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes
than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(m) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances or

restrictions existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens;”

(n) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any Hedging Agreements;

determination by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing; and

extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts,
instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (q), or in this clause (r), of this paragraph
(2); _provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, extension, increases,_
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, no
more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances or restrictions than those contained

161


-----

in the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal,
extension, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly established

Subsidiaries) to cease to be a “Restricted Subsidiary” and instead to be an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation;

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the

effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant (and
may classify such amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments and ability to make payments
that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant
as it sees fit) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s interest in such
Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s interest in
such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith); and

(c) the Issuer would be permitted under the Indenture to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to

the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant at the time of such designation
(assuming the effectiveness of such designation).

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment constituting a

Restricted Payment pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant for all purposes of the
Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary
calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary
(in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith), and may classify such amount within its capacity to
make Restricted Payments and permissions to make payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments
under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant as it sees fit.

(3) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur and be

continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) unless such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not have any Debt outstanding (other than Debt that

would be Permitted Debt), immediately before and after giving effect to such proposed designation, and
after giving _pro forma effect to the Incurrence of any such Debt of such designated Unrestricted_
Subsidiary as if such Debt was Incurred on the date of its designation as a Restricted Subsidiary, the
Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the
“Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board of

Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors with the
Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation
complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such designation. Any such filing
with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal half year in which such
designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the second fiscal half year of the Issuer’s
fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

(1) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated

balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including
complete notes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a

162


-----

discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the
Issuer; (c) a description of the business of the Issuer; and (d) a description of management and
shareholders, material debt instruments, material affiliate transactions, material risk factors and material
subsequent events all in substantially the same form as presented in the Offering Memorandum, within
120 days following the end of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024;
_provided that the information in clause (d) may be provided in the notes to the audited financial_
statements.

(b) semi-annual financial information of the Issuer on a consolidated basis as of and for the period from the

beginning of each year to the close of the first half period, together with comparable information for the
corresponding period of the preceding year, and an operating and financial review of the financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and material changes
in liquidity and financial resources of the Issuer within 90 days following the end of the fiscal half
beginning with the fiscal half ending June 30, 2024; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, any change of the

Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer
or any other material event, a report containing a description of such event.

(2) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the

Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure
not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

(3) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted

Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of
the Issuer, then the semi-annual and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports to Holders” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(4) For so long as it remains so listed, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that the Issuer

is required to make publicly available under the requirements of the London Stock Exchange as a result of
having its ordinary shares admitted for trading on such exchange. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this
covenant, upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements of the London Stock Exchange
(regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such exchange), to the extent
that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual reports,
information, documents and other reports, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in clauses (1)(a), (b) and (c) above.

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee,

the Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information referenced above in
clauses (1)(a), (b) and (c) and (3) above or alternatively, in the preceding paragraph, has been posted on the
Issuer’s website.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Report to Holders” covenant
is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such information, documents and reports shall not
constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of
the covenants under the Indenture. All reports made pursuant to this covenant shall be made in, or translated to,
the English language.

**_Statement as to Compliance_**

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee no later than the date on which the Issuer is required to deliver annual reports
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Reports to Holders” above, an Officer’s Certificate stating that in
the course of the performance by the relevant officers of their respective duties as an officer of the Issuer they
would normally have knowledge of any Default and whether or not such officers know of any Default that

163


-----

occurred during such period and, if any, specifying such Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

**_Issuer_**

(1) The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge,

consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which the Issuer would dispose
of, all or substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ properties and assets, taken as a
whole, to any other Person. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving
effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed

by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or to which such
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has been made (the “Surviving
Entity”):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member state of

the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, any
state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland; and

(y) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, an accession agreement or one or more other

documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (and

treating any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with or as a result of
such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (on the

assumption that the transaction or series of transactions occurred on the first day of the fiscal half
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions with the appropriate
adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being included in such pro forma
calculation), (i) the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor under the
Indenture) could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of
the “Limitation on Debt” covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of

counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required
in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements of the
Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer
or the Surviving Entity, enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to customary assumptions,
exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the

Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture, provided, however, that in the case of a lease of all or substantially
all of the Issuer’s assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest, on the Notes.

164


-----

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or

transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) the Issuer from consolidating or otherwise combining with or merging into an Affiliate
incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the
Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Issuer, _provided the requirements of_
clauses (a)(x) and (d) of paragraph (1) above are satisfied, mutatis mutandis.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of any merger of the Issuer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules
and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of
the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Guarantors_**

(1) Subject to the provisions described under “—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,” no Guarantor will,

directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge, consolidate,
amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by such Guarantor’s Board of
Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to which such Guarantor will
dispose of, all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s properties and assets to any other Person. The previous
sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of
transactions:

(a) either: (i) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation, or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving any such

consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation organized or existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, the United
States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor), by a supplemental indenture, an accession

agreement or one or more other documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, expressly assumes the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture;

(c) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists and

is continuing; and

(d) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an

opinion of counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is
required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture and the Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor or Successor Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,

the relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into or

transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property
or assets of a Person.

165

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing
until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the
provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(2) “—Limitation on Debt;”

(3) “—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(5) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt;”

(6) clause (1)(c) of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” in respect of each of the Issuer and the

Guarantors;

(7) “—Limitation on Asset Sales;” and

(8) “—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries.”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Issuer nor any Restricted
Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described
under the caption “—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” unless such designation would
have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such
covenant would have been in effect during such period.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on
which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard
to actions of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension
Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Debt.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default,_
the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having
an Investment Grade Status. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this
caption has been satisfied, _provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the_
covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of
the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status
or upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or
maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability or permission under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or any other similar transaction
(the “Applicable Transaction”) where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence
(including in respect of Incurrence of Debt, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments), the date of

166


-----

determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be
(A) the date the definitive agreements for such Applicable Transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios
shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Applicable Transaction and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or
ratio) or (B) the date of consummation of any Applicable Transaction.

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such
basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Fixed Charges of the
Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant Applicable Transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of
such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Applicable Transaction and the related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of
entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of
proceeds thereof and the fixing of any exchange rates) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreements are entered into and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Applicable Transaction.

Subject to the limitations imposed under paragraph (3) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant, if a proposed action,
matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is Incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and
at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the
Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such
ratio-based permission.

In the event any fixed permissions are intended to be utilized together with any ratio-based permissions in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, (i) compliance with or satisfaction of any ratio-based permission for
the portion of such indebtedness or other applicable transaction or action to be incurred under such ratio-based
permission shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts being utilized pursuant to any fixed
permission but giving full pro forma effect to all applicable and related transactions (including, subject to the
foregoing with respect to fixed baskets, any incurrence and repayments of indebtedness) and all other permitted
pro forma adjustments, and (ii) thereafter, incurrence of the portion of such indebtedness or other applicable
transaction or action to be incurred under any fixed permissions shall be calculated.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon acceleration,

optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure by the Issuer to comply with the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale

_of Assets;”_

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary that is

contained in the Indenture (other than specified in clauses (a), (b) or (c) (solely as it relates to the Issuer)
above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt for borrowed money (other than

any such Debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, if
that default:

(i) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt; or

167


-----

(ii) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the expiration of

any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required prepayment) and such
failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a
“Payment Default”),

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Debt, together with the principal amount of any other
such Debt under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates to the greater of £50.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA or more;

(f) any Guarantee by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing

by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other
than as provided for in the Indenture or any Guarantee), if such Default continues for 10 days;

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by insurance) shall have

been rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for the payment of money either individually
or in an aggregate amount, in each case in excess of the greater of £50.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA (after deducting any insurance or indemnity or contribution amounts actually recovered by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days of such judgment, order or decree), and either a creditor shall
have commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such judgment, order or decree or there shall have been a
period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree
was not (by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in effect; and

(h) pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law, the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy,

insolvency, receivership, schemes of arrangement (where any creditors are materially impaired) or
reorganization with respect to the Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary, or of other Restricted Subsidiaries that
are not Significant Subsidiaries but would, in the aggregate, when taken together (as of the end of the most
recently completed fiscal period) constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person.

However, a Default under clauses (d), (e) or (g) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the
Default and, with respect to clauses (d) and (g) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in
clauses (d) or (g) above, as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (h) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the
Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written request
of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid
interest on all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such
amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if
any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of
Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (e) under
“Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (e) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such
Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured
or waived.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of
the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture (except a default in the payment of

168


-----

the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which case, the consent of
the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind any such acceleration with respect
to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction, and provided that the fees and expenses of the Trustee have been paid.

No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any
remedy thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such
proceedings as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding
within 60 days after receipt of such written notice and receipt of indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it and
the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however,
apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Note.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer
of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will deliver to each Holder
of the Notes notice of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of an
Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes,
the Trustee may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if it determines in good faith that
withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of the Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge or written notice, that the Issuer is
duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and
that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders provide to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity of the
Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes (“Legal Defeasance”). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged
the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,

Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace mutilated,

destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and
segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and the

Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

169


-----

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default other than an Event of Default under clauses (a) or (b) of the definition thereof.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and
thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events
_of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events will not include_
events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise
its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee, or such other entity as

may be designated for this purpose, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in euros, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an
internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and discharge the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must:

(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; and

(ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the outstanding Notes;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published
by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling that the Issuer can rely on; or (ii) since the Issue Date, there
has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that (and based thereon
such opinion shall confirm that) the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably

acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing: (i) on the date of such deposit (other

than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit); or
(ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in clause (h) of “—Events of Default” above are
concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a

Default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied
to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or instrument to which the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions,

exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability) in the country of the
Issuer’s incorporation to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and an opinion of counsel (subject to customary assumptions, exceptions,
reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability) reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee that the Trustee shall have a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the rateable benefit of
the Holders of the Notes;

170


-----

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by

the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or other creditors, or removing
assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing debts of the Issuer to the detriment of the
relevant creditors;

(h) no event or condition exists that would prevent the Issuer from making payments of the principal of, premium,

if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any time ending on the
123rd day after the date of such deposit; and

(i) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating

that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as
the case may be, have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee or such other entity to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of any
acceleration occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain liable for such
payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration
of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity as is

designated for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euros or European Government
Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that have not, prior to such time,
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts
and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have
become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has
delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen Notes

that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been deposited on trust or
segregated and held on trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust
as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation: (x) have become due and

payable (by reason of the sending, or delivery to Euroclear and Clearstream in the case of a Global Note,
of a notice of redemption or otherwise); (y) will become due and payable within one year of Stated
Maturity; or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year of the proposed discharge date under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee
in the Issuer’s name and at the Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture; provided

that if requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included
in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate) no later than five (5) Business
Days or such shorter period as the Trustee or the Paying Agent may agree prior to such distribution, the
Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts deposited prior to maturity or the redemption date,
as the case may be; provided, further, that in such case, the payment to each Holder will equal the amount
such Holder would have been entitled to receive at maturity or on the relevant redemption date, as the case
may be, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or
relevant redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
break cost or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent that the Notes are represented by Global
Notes deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding
interests as a participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the
clearing system;

171


-----

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the

payment of the Notes at maturity, on the redemption date or such earlier date as instructed by the Issuer in
accordance with clause (b) above, as the case may be; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate and (ii) an opinion of counsel (subject to

customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to
enforceability), each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without
independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact)
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)(i)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
such Notes), the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or supplement the Indenture
(including the Guarantees) or the Notes, or waive any default or compliance with any provisions thereof (unless
a modification or amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, in which case only the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in such series shall be required);
_provided that no such modification, amendment or waiver may, without the consent of Holders holding not less_
than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (or, if a modification or
amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in such series):

(a) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of or Additional Amounts or interest on, any

Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (a) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate of or extend

the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause
(b) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(c) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such

Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption;”

(d) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional Amounts

or the interest thereon is payable on or after the due dates thereof;

(e) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance with the

provisions of such Note and the Indenture;

(f) make any change to the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in

this sentence; and

(g) release any Guarantee, other than in compliance with the guarantor release provisions of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture (including the Guarantees) or the Notes, as applicable,
to:

(a) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by any such

successor of the covenants in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, in accordance with
“—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” or Permitted Reorganization;

(b) add to the Issuer’s covenants or those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes for the

benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any
Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes, as applicable, in the Indenture, the Notes or any
Guarantee;

172


-----

(c) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect error or inconsistency;

(d) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee to any provision of this Description of the

Notes to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim or
substantially verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) release any Guarantor in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture;

(f) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described under

“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,”
to add Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien or any amendment in respect thereof with respect
to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is not prohibited
by the Indenture;

(g) evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture;

(h) make any change that would provide additional rights of or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does

not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under
the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee (as determined by the Issuer in good faith in respect of Holders);
and

(i) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted by the terms of and

limitations set forth in the Indenture.

The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel
as to the permissibility of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment to the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of the
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency other
than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in
the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a Holder of the
Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute
a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
possible to purchase euro on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that
could be recovered following such a purchase is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient
under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the recipient against the cost
of the recipient’s making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes of
this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Trustee and/or Holder to certify that it would have suffered a loss had
the actual purchase of euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or
recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have
been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount

in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

173


-----

**Notices**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the ISM and the rules and regulations of the ISM so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to the extent and in
the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by
Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed; and provided, further, that any notice delivered via e-mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to
have been “sent” in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder
shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to send a notice or communication to a Holder or any
defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is sent in
the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication
is given via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by
accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release will be part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a
responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default,
of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of Trustee in accordance with the notice
provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture
and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed
as an obligation or duty. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, certain taxes
and expenses incurred without gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from responsibility,
including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

2026 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at

referred to in clauses (a) through (e) above, or the amount of income or earnings relating thereto, and the _pro_
_forma calculations in respect thereof (including, without limitation, in respect of anticipated cost savings or_
synergies relating to any such transaction (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings or synergies

Issuer or an authorized responsible financial or accounting Officer of the Issuer and (2) when determining pro
_forma Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issuer may adjust Consolidated_
EBITDA to add an amount equal to the cost savings or synergies projected to be realized as the result of actions

_provided that in any event or circumstance that results in such Debt ceasing to qualify as Subordinated_
Shareholder Debt, such Debt shall constitute an Incurrence of such Debt by the Issuer, and any and all

201


-----

Restricted Payments made through the use of the net proceeds from the Incurrence of such Debt since the

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

Any Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Any Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue
Date, the Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book Entry Interests, the “Book Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, Book Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

The Book Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in the book entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The
laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may
impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form,
holders of Book Entry Interests will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. Euroclear and Clearstream will credit a participant’s
account on their book entry transfer and registration systems with the interest beneficially owned by such
participant.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or the common
depositary’s nominee), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture
governing the Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which
they own Book Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the
Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustee, any of the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, and the Registrar (collectively, the
“Agents”), nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book
Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal
to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less than €100,000
principal amount may be redeemed in part.

203


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the
common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description
_of the Notes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under_
“Description of the Notes” above, the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net
amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such
Global Note or Book Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book
Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
(collectively, the "Agents") or any of their respective agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes
(i.e., the common depositary or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for
all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents or any of their respective agents has
or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account
of, a Book Entry Interest, or Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to payments made on account of a Book Entry Interest;

- the common depositary, Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “stock name.”

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid through Euroclear or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Agents
or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any
commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with such payment.

**Action by owners of book entry interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book Entry Interests are credited and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the
granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there
is an event of default under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes,
reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive
Registered Notes to their participants.

204


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Transfers of beneficial interests in Rule 144A Global Notes to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency will at all times be subject to
such transfer restrictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (if available). Beneficial
interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional
buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in
accordance with any applicable state securities laws.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book Entry Interest in
one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book Entry Interest in
the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter
be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book Entry Interests in such other
Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book Entry Interest.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest or vice versa, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A
Global Note or vice versa.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined below):

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(ii) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(iii) if the owner of a Book Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

205


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book Entry Interest described in
the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be issued
Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of holders and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable
law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee
in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the
holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent
appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our
requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered
Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which
any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses
in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the indenture, we in
our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book Entry Interests only in accordance with
the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and their
respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof
and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be
evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a
means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and
Clearstream.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents, the Initial Purchasers nor any of their
respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities
for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between
their respective participants through electronic book entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and

206


-----

Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance,
settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear
and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

As Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Special timing considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business. In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. United States investors
who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on
a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels, if
Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book entry system**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance
with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Agents, or any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business
day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary market trading**

The Book Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can
be made on the desired value date.

207

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain tax consequences of the Offering and is intended as general information_
_only. Tax legislation, including in the country where the investor is domiciled or tax resident and in the Issuer’s_
_country of incorporation, may have an impact on the income that an investor receives from the Notes. Prospective_
_holders of Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the tax laws of_
_the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of the Notes, including, without limitation, the consequences_
_of the receipt of interest and premium, if any, on any sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

**U.K. TAXATION**

The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of
the Notes and is based on current U.K. law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice as at the
date hereof (which may not be binding on HMRC), both of which are subject to change, possibly with
retrospective effect. This description is not exhaustive and relates only to the position of persons who are the
absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain classes of persons, such as brokers, dealers
in securities, individuals holding the Notes through an ISA, persons connected with the Issuer or certain
professional investors, to whom special rules may apply. This description does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes and does not constitute legal or tax advice, and any
holders who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their independent professional advisors. Any
holders (or prospective holders) of the Notes who are subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom
should consult their independent professional advisors.

The references to “interest” and “premium” in this section are to “interest” and “premium” as understood for the
purposes of U.K. tax law. They do not take into account any different definitions of “interest” and “premium” that
may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related
document.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of Section 987 of the Income Tax Act
2007 (the “ITA”) while they carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the ITA for the purposes of Section 987 of the ITA, or are
admitted to trading on a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a “regulated recognised stock exchange”
within the meaning of Section 987 of the ITA. While the Notes are, and continue to be, quoted Eurobonds,
payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K.
income tax. The ISM is a multilateral trading facility operated by an EEA-regulated recognised stock exchange
(the London Stock Exchange) for these purposes. So long as this remains the case with respect to the Notes,
the Notes will constitute quoted Eurobonds.

If the Notes do not (or cease to) constitute “quoted Eurobonds,” an amount may, subject to (i) any relief available
under any applicable double taxation treaty and (ii) the availability of any other relief or exemption, have to be
withheld on account of U.K. income tax from payments of interest on the Notes at the “basic rate” of U.K. income
tax (currently 20%).

If interest were to be paid under deduction of U.K. income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident in the
United Kingdom for tax purposes may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate
provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

Where Notes are issued on terms that a premium is or may be payable on redemption then any such element of
premium may constitute a payment of interest for U.K. tax purposes and, if so, the provisions described above
relevant to interest will apply.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor which is (i) resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or (ii) is not resident for tax purposes
in the U.K. and which otherwise makes a payment which is considered to arise in the United Kingdom for the

208


-----

purposes of Part 15 of the ITA, in each case, makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other
amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes), it is possible that
such payments may be subject to U.K. deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K. income tax at the “basic
rate (as noted above, this is currently 20%), subject to any claim which could be made under an applicable double
taxation treaty or any other relief or exemption which may apply (including under U.K. domestic legislation).
Such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the quoted Eurobonds exemption described above.

**_Tax by Direct Assessment_**

Interest on the Notes may constitute U.K. source income for U.K. tax purposes and accordingly may be chargeable
to U.K. income or corporation tax by direct assessment even where paid without deduction or withholding for or
on account of U.K. tax. However, the interest will not generally be assessed to U.K. tax in the hands of holders of
the Notes who are not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except (in the case of an individual) where
the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation through a branch or agency or (in the case of a corporate
holder) carries on trade in the United Kingdom in connection with which the interest is received or to which the
Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent)
U.K. corporation or income tax may be levied on the U.K. branch, agency or permanent establishment or
otherwise.

**_United Kingdom Holders Subject to Corporation Tax_**

In general, holders of the Notes who are within the charge to U.K. corporation tax will be charged to tax on income
in respect of all profits, gains and losses on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to
currency fluctuations or otherwise) measured and recognized in each accounting period broadly in accordance
with their statutory accounting treatment, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice,
under the “loan relationships” rules in Part 5 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009.

**_United Kingdom Holders not Subject to Corporation Tax_**

If the Notes do not constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income
Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, the disposal of the Notes by an individual holder who is resident for
tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom
through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable
loss for the purposes of U.K. tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances. In calculating any
gain or allowable loss on the disposal of the Notes, sterling values are compared at acquisition and disposal.
Accordingly, a taxable gain can arise even where the euro amount received on a disposal is less than or the same
as the euro amount paid for the Notes.

Special rules may apply to individuals who have ceased to be resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom
and who dispose of their Notes before becoming once again resident in the U.K. Noteholders are advised to consult
their own professional advisors if they require any advice or further information relating to residency.

On the disposal of Notes by a holder (where the Notes do not constitute deeply discounted securities), any interest
which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be chargeable to tax on income under the rule relating
to accrued income profits as set out in Chapter 2 of Part 12 of the ITA if that holder is resident for tax purposes
in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or
agency to which the Notes are attributable.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue of the Notes. No U.K. stamp duty or
stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on a transfer of, or an agreement to transfer, the Notes provided
that the Notes do not carry and will not at any time carry (i) a right to interest the amount of which exceeds a
reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital, nor (ii) a right on repayment to an
amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the capital and is not reasonably comparable with what is
generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital
(as that term is understood for the purposes of section 79 of the Finance Act 1986) listed in the Official List
of the London Stock Exchange.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This
discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for discussions on
FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the
impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings
from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the
matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be
sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions,
U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (or investors in such entities or
arrangements), persons liable for any alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as
a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial
statement and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other
integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original
issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold for money, not
including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of
the Code (generally, assets held for investment). This summary does not address persons holding Existing Notes
that are repurchased in connection with the Offering.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity
classified as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. An entity or arrangement treated as holder that is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes that is considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax
advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income**
**tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the**
**U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**Characterization of the Notes**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and
interest. We intend to take the position that the contingencies that may result in such payments should not cause
the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations.
Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any
such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder

210


-----

discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged
our position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders would be required
to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate, regardless of the holder’s method of
accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not
be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences
thereof.

**Payments of Stated Interest**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and
without reduction for amounts withheld, if any) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources
outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive
category income.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to
the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether
the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable
to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest
in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each
taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating
such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the relevant interest accrual period (or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S.
holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual method U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last
day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period ending on the last day of a taxable year), or at the
spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period.
A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or
loss, on the date interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment,
translated at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest previously
included in income in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source
ordinary income or loss and not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable
limitations. Recently issued final Treasury Regulations may further restrict a U.S. holder’s ability to claim such
credits. However, pursuant to subsequent guidance from the IRS which indicates that the U.S. Department of the
Treasury and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to such Treasury Regulations, taxpayers may,
subject to certain conditions, defer the application of many aspects of such Treasury Regulations before the date
that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued (or any later date specified
in such notice or other guidance). The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules
that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the availability of foreign tax credits.

**Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes**

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder. The cost
of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on
the date of the purchase, calculated at the spot rate in effect on that date.

211


-----

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to
accrued and unpaid interest, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance with
the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount
of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount translated at the spot rate on the date of
taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects,
an accrual method taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of
the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An
accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain
or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the trade date and settlement date.
Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the
principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined using the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note
in foreign currency determined using the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange
gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated
as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest,”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain
or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and
generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. holder (including an
individual), any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**Tax Return Disclosure Requirement**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, including in connection with the receipt or accrual of interest on, or the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note.
U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, payments of interest and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is
an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements. U.S. holders may be required to provide such certification
on IRS Form W-9.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the appropriate
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets**

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals (and certain entities) that hold an interest in “specified foreign financial
assets” (which may include the Notes or certain financial account through which a U.S. holder holds the Notes )
are required to report information (on IRS form 8938) relating to such assets, subject to certain exceptions
(including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). U.S. holders who
fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties, and, in such circumstances, the
statute of limitations for assessment of tax could be suspended, in whole or part. U.S. holders should consult their
tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), and subject to
the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax
on certain foreign passthru payments to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source
payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be
“grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if an Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, withholding under FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering
period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not
otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the
date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments.
Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Holders should
consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any
withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional
amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**CERTAIN MALAYSIAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Withholding tax**

Under present Malaysian law, where a Malaysian resident is liable to make a payment of interest to a non-resident
of Malaysia, it shall deduct withholding tax at the prescribed rate from such payment and pay that tax to the
Director General of Inland Revenue within 1 month after such payment has been made or credited to the nonresident. If Synthomer Sdn Bhd (the “Malaysian Guarantor”) makes payment to a non-resident of Malaysia
under or with respect to its Guarantee which constitutes an interest income under the Income Tax Act 1967 of
Malaysia, such payment will be subject to withholding tax.

It is a term of the Guarantee that the Malaysian Guarantor shall, in the event of any such withholding, pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary to the holder of the Notes so as to ensure that the holder of the Notes
receive the full amount which they would have received had no such withholding been imposed.

**_Stamp duty_**

Malaysian stamp duty will be payable (i) on the Indenture executed by the Malaysian Guarantor at the fixed rate
of 0.5% of the guaranteed principal amount and (ii) on each other document executed by the Malaysian Guarantor
in connection with the Notes and its Guarantee at the fixed rate of MYR10.00, within 30 days after it has been
executed in Malaysia or, if it is executed only outside Malaysia, within 30 days after it has been first received in
Malaysia. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations—Malaysia— _Limitations on Granting of_
_Guarantees.”_

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in some of the jurisdictions in_
_which the Issuer and each Guarantor are incorporated, and a summary of certain limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to_
_discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Notes and the_
_Guarantees. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain_
_matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply,_
_which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under_
_the Notes and the Guarantees. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with_
_respect to all such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of a Member State or Member States
of the European Union (in this section references to Member States relate to member states of the European Union
excluding Denmark), including Germany and Italy.

The EU Insolvency Regulation became fully effective on June 26, 2017, replacing the previous Council
Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court
requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to
Article 3. Article 3(1) provides that the court that has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation
to a company is the court of the Member State in which that company has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”).
The forms of insolvency proceedings that can comprise main proceedings are listed in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation and include, in respect of the U.K., administration, compulsory liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation with confirmation by the court (see “—Administration” and “—Liquidation/Winding Up”
below). The determination of where a company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views and may change from time to time, but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings. Under paragraph 2 of Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place where its
registered office is located. This rebuttable presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved
to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of main insolvency
proceedings. The EU Insolvency Regulation specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption
of the COMI being at the place of the registered office may be rebutted if the company’s central administration is
located in a member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive
assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that
other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to where board meetings are held, the
location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the
majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and their perception as to where a company conducts the
administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the
new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the
change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other
appropriate means).

The European Court of Justice has held that the presumption can only be rebutted if factors which are both
objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what a typical
third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that
the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004). Factors which may be taken into
account include the places where the company’s business is managed and operated, board meetings held and the
accounts prepared and audited.

Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its
registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption
cannot be rebutted (Interedil S.r.l. (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil S.r.l. and another C-396/09).

214


-----

The point at which a company’s COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency
proceedings are opened—although note that there is a three month look back period as regards the presumption
of the company’s center of main interests.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in
other Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member State where
the company has an “establishment.” An establishment is defined in Article 2(10) as a place of operations where
a company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. This means a fixed place of business
and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal administration). The effect of secondary proceedings
is limited to the assets located in that Member State.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment shall
be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company
situated in the territory of such other Member State.

The EU Insolvency Regulation contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary
proceedings, as well as provisions dealing with insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies.

_Secondary insolvency proceedings_

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation must be
recognized in any other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in
other Member States. Under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor’s center of main
interest, the "COMI") is in a given Member State (other than Denmark), the courts of all other Member States
(except Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only if the debtor
has an “establishment” in that other Member State’s territory. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency
proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not
limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are
commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. “Establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or, in the
three-month period before the request to open main insolvency proceedings, has carried out a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings
or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the
debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of
main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such
other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the company
has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in
another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment where either (i) insolvency
proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the company’s COMI is situated under the
conditions laid down by that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is
requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (b)
a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is
situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are
opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the
insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject
to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has
assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the company).

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment opening insolvency
proceedings of the court commencing proceedings (subject to any public policy exception). The judgment of the
court commencing main proceedings will produce the same effects in the other Member States (other than
Denmark) as under the law of the Member State (other than Denmark) commencing main proceedings, so long as
no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other
Member State and subject to certain other exceptions (e.g., rights in rem situated in another Member State remain

215


-----

subject to the original law governing that right). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in
the Member State, which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings, may exercise the powers conferred on
it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that
other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that
no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the
contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State
where the company has assets).

However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency
proceedings in another Member State, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent
the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings by giving a unilateral undertaking with respect to the assets
located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the
insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant
national law and from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in that
Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval
by a majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking
is binding on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should
refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of
local creditors.

_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism with the concept
of “group coordination proceedings” in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members
of a group of companies are opened in Member States (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings
concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court
which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open
proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the
effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not
entail any conflict of interest. Further, an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings concerning
a member of a group of companies shall cooperate and communicate with any court with jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of another group member.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation also contains provisions for the proposal and implementation of a group
coordination plan and group coordination proceedings, which are designed and implemented by a group
coordinator. Participation in the group coordination plan is not compulsory for group members, and there are
safeguards to preserve the sovereignty of the applicable law and courts of each group members’ insolvency
proceedings.

_Applicability_

In the event that any Guarantor incorporated in European Union experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Guarantors.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (the “English Guarantors”) are companies incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales. The Issuer’s and the English Guarantors’ registered offices are also located in England and
Wales.

**_Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts_**

While the U.K was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the U.K. were subject to both EU
and applicable U.K. domestic legislation. Following the U.K.’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 and
the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance
with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement)
Act 2020), EU law as directly applicable in the U.K. at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain
exceptions) was transposed into U.K. domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU
insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the U.K., including the EU Insolvency Regulation, and domestic
insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales)
Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI
2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition
Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the
proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to English companies would likely proceed under, and be
governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings.
However, to the extent that an English company has its COMI in a member state of the EU (other than Denmark)
insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be
opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, certain
foreign courts may assume jurisdiction to oversee the insolvency proceedings of any English company which has
its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity
with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction or has “sufficient connection” with that
jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in
England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any
company which has its COMI in the UK or has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an
“establishment” in the UK (also defined as being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets or services) or which is incorporated in an EEA Member State.
While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent
of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English
Obligor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on
English guarantees. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their
rights under the English Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an
insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act (as amended) and the onshored version of the EU Insolvency Regulation empower English
courts to make an administration order in respect of a company incorporated in England and Wales, Scotland or
an EEA state, a company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in a member state of the EU (other
than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in the UK or a company (wherever
incorporated) with its COMI in a member state of the EU and an “establishment” in the UK. In each case, and
subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant
company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely
to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow”
basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the

217


-----

company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the
company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full or in
part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English
company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, where the floating charge
has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according
to the identity of the appointer. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked
at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a
better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither
of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily
harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The
order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out in “—Priority on insolvency” below.

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment
of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent
of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the
institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against
the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining
any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Unless extended, administration terminates automatically after a year. An administration may be extended by
court order or may also be extended with the consent of the creditors up to a maximum period of one further year,
provided that the court has not previously extended the administration and that creditors have not previously
consented to any prior extension. The relevant company may exit administration if the administrator is satisfied
that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon application to and by order of the court if
the administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume normal business upon exiting
administration. However, the administrator also has the power, should they conclude that there is no reasonable
prospect of rescuing the company, to either place the company into liquidation or use their powers under, and in
accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company’s assets and thereby achieve substantially the same
result as a liquidation.

Accordingly, if any Guarantor incorporated in England were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the
court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee would obtain this permission of
the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements
under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration. While an administrator is in
office in respect of the Issuer of the English Guarantors, the powers of the board of directors of such the Issuer of
the English Guarantors (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of the administrator's powers, and those
permitted by the administrator) are suspended.

**_Administrative receivership_**

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party
will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court and, in the case of the ability to
appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates
September 15, 2003 in England, fall within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act as amended by the
Enterprise Act 2002 in England to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to
constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that
the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the
company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given
by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act in England. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if
such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or
substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a
qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative
receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may

218


-----

apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant company during the life of
the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the
Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated,
listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by
the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to
which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a
preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate
office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Liquidation/winding up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the
Insolvency Act. See “—Priority on insolvency.” There are two forms of winding up: (i) compulsory liquidation,
by order of the court; and (ii) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by
resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of
the company in question; in members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory
declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the
creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section
123 of the Insolvency Act – see “Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other
than as an exit from administration) is initiated by resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the
process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition
to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only
available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding up. In a
compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to
certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have
commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the
court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued
or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on enforcement
of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding
up order; the winding up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent
of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay of proceedings in the case of a voluntary
winding up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. As with a
compulsory liquidation, this is important because it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce
their security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business
of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute
documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

In light of the coronavirus pandemic, legislation was introduced to restrict temporarily the ability of creditors to
present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. These temporary measures (a) raised the
threshold upon which a winding up petition may be presented from £750 to £10,000; (b) allowed a creditor to
present a winding up petition only after expiry of a 21 day period during which the debtor had failed to provide a
proposal for repayment satisfactory to the creditor; and (c) prevented landlords petitioning to wind up tenants for
unpaid rent arrears arising as a result of coronavirus. The measures expired without renewal on 31 March 2022.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have
agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to
the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only
respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of
their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or
liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the
company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
covers that indebtedness and parties with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not under
the full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor (but only with respect to the assets in which they
have a proprietary interest);

  - _Second ranking: moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts in respect of a moratorium under_
Part A1 of the U.K. Insolvency Act. Where a company goes into administration, or proceedings for the
winding-up of a company are begun, within 12 weeks of the end of a moratorium under Part A1 of the
U.K. Insolvency Act, certain categories of debt must be paid in priority of all other claims (though this
does not affect the rights or ranking in liquidation or administration, of creditors holding fixed charges,
nor does it apply against any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement
within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003). Moratorium
debts are any debt or liability that falls due during or after the Part A1 moratorium by reason of an
obligation incurred during it. Priority pre-moratorium debts comprises the following debts or liabilities
where the company becomes subject to them before or while the moratorium is in force due to an
obligation incurred before the moratorium comes into force and relate to: (i) the monitor’s remuneration
or expenses; (ii) payment for goods or services supplied during the moratorium; (iii) rent in respect of a
period during the moratorium; (iv) wages or salary arising under a contract of employment, so far as
relating to a period of employment before or during the moratorium; (v) liability to make a redundancy
payment that fell due before or during the moratorium; and (vi) debt due under a contract or other
instrument involving financial services that fell due before or during the moratorium (unless, broadly, it
fell due only because of the use or operation of acceleration provisions in the relevant arrangements that
were triggered in the run up to, or during, the moratorium);

  - _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_
priority in which expenses are paid);

  - _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

    - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800
per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits
eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the
statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

    - Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts.
Such secondary preferential debts include: (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation
under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit and (b) claims by HMRC for taxes
including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme
deductions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers but excluding

220


-----

corporation tax and employers’ NI contributions. As between one another, secondary preferential
debts rank equally;

  - _Fifth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_
include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which,
on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations
to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain
exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - _Sixth ranking:_

    - _firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured_
shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

    - _secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual_
rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which either preceded such liquidation or which had been
converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts
due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the Noteholders may, if there are
sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

    - _thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above_
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This
does not include currency conversion claims; and

  - _Seventh ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant
documentation (provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act or English common law).

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g. administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally
be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating
charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the
company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a
maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to
the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate
cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so
would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Avoidance of transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of guarantees
can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation
within a specified period after the granting of the guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an
administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the
validity of the guarantee given by such company.

The Company cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be
challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to any
guarantee granted by an English company include, without limitation, the following described below.

221


-----

_Avoidance of floating charges_

Under English insolvency law, a floating charge granted by a guarantor is invalid if (i) the floating charge was
given in exchange only for prior consideration; (ii) the floating charge was made at a relevant time that is one year
before the onset of insolvency (where the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years before the onset of
insolvency (where the beneficiary is a connected person); and (iii) at the time the floating charge was granted, the
guarantor was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a consequence of the charge (unless the
charge was created in favor of a then connected person, in which case, there is no insolvency requirement). An
administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating
charge is invalid by operation of law. However, this provision does not apply to any charge created or otherwise
arising under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside a
guarantee (or grant other relief) where such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of
the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section
123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s insolvency (as
described below) is within a period of two years from the date such company grants the guarantee. However, a
court will not make an order if it is satisfied that a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the
purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the
transaction would benefit such company. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate
that the company was unable to pay its debts except where the relevant transaction at an undervalue was made
with a connected person (as described below), in which case there is a presumption that the company was insolvent
at the time unless it can be shown otherwise by the connected person. If the court determines that the transaction
was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the
position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

We believe that the Notes will not be issued on terms which would amount to a transaction at an undervalue, that
this Offering is in good faith for the purposes of carrying on our business and that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that the transaction will benefit us. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes
will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis.

Similarly, an English liquidator or administrator of any Guarantor incorporated in England could apply to the
court to unwind the issue of its Guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that the issue of such
Guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The analysis of such a claim would generally be the same
as set out above in relation to our issue of the Notes. We believe that each Guarantee will not be a transaction at
an undervalue and that each Guarantee will be provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on the business
of each Guarantor incorporated in England and its subsidiaries and that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the transactions will benefit each such Guarantor. However, there can be no assurance that the provision of
the Note Guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our
analysis.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside a
guarantee (or grant other relief) where such guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the
company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency
Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if
the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person,
except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the
date the company grants the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of
putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor of any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better

222


-----

position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety
would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order
unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position
in relation to that person when taking their decision. This provision of English insolvency law may affect
transactions entered into or payments made by any of the Guarantors during the relevant period prior to the
Guarantor’s liquidation or administration.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its
debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary
of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of
being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position
and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to
prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore
the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include
reducing payment due under or setting aside guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was
given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than
the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to
that person at a time when he was a creditor of the company.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as discussed
above), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration
order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date
on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court,
whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation
follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

_Connected persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a “connected
person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator
or liquidator (as set out above).

A connected person of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an
undervalue and preferences is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) shadow director; (c) an associate
of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband,
wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is
also an associate of any person he employs. A person is an associate of any person with whom they are in
partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom they are in
partnership.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has
control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the
other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same

223


-----

persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of
either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or
he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting
of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either
of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

Where a transaction entered into by an English company was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was
made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against that company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which
that person is making or may make, then the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding
creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in
liquidation or administration), and not just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim. Subject to certain
conditions, this provision may also be used by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions
Regulator. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be made (subject to the normal statutory
limitation periods) and the company need not be insolvent at the time of, or as result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or
impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into.
However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than
the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require
a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to
the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can
review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years ending with the day
on which the English company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate”
if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to
require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect
of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee by any of the English companies in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an
action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English company in
good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate
benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed
transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company (as applicable) for the benefit
of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial
benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being
set aside by a court.

224


-----

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, any
debt of a company payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as US dollars in the case of the Notes)
must be converted by the insolvency office-holder into pounds sterling at a single exchange rate for that currency
determined by the insolvency office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date.
This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. Accordingly, in the event of a Guarantor’s liquidation
or administration, the Noteholders may be subject to exchange rate risk between the relevant date and receipt of
any amounts to which such the Noteholders may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations
are not recoverable from the insolvent estate. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply
to the court.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

In order to propose a company voluntary arrangement, a company must either (i) be registered in England and
Wales or Scotland; or (ii) be incorporated in an EEA state; or (iii) if not incorporated in an EEA state, have its
COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark).

A company voluntary arrangement is a procedure intended to allow companies to avoid potentially terminal
insolvency proceedings and to address their financial difficulties by obtaining a binding agreement or compromise
with their unsecured creditors. Although it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a company voluntary
arrangement is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who acts as the nominee before
the company voluntary proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. A company voluntary
arrangement may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure, such as administration, in order
to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable)
may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing
of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of
a decision procedure) and shareholders, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the
proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security,
except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor
to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential
creditors, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by
value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. However, if the company’s creditors approve the proposal, the company
voluntary arrangement will be implemented notwithstanding a vote against by the members. Secured debt cannot
be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is
undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may
be deemed to have given up its security.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have
jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise between a company and its creditors
(or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of their financial
liabilities. In addition, a foreign company which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a
“sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is
likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other
things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the
company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.

225


-----

Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court in England considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or
arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the
scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors (although a creditor-led scheme would
nonetheless require the consent of the company or its insolvency officeholder). If a majority in number
representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors
vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors,
including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The
scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of
the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme
as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part
26A thereof, which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company
and its creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’. While
generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking
to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial
difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a
compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) for
the purpose of eliminating, reducing or preventing, or mitigating the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or
administrator appointed to the company. The consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholder) is required
if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote
on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes
depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new
rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Unlike a scheme of arrangement, the court may
order that a class of creditors or shareholders with no genuine economic interest in the company be excluded from
voting on the restructuring plan but still bound by it if the court subsequently sanctions the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors and/or members (if
applicable) present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed
compromise. There is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those
creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of
the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse
off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and
(b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a
genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for
the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the
company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process
provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan
even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing
the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court
has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan
binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective

226


-----

(in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar
of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger
a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Part A1 moratorium_**

The Part A1 moratorium process was introduced into the Insolvency Act from 26 June 2020. It is designed to
allow a short moratorium of up to 40 business days to be obtained by companies in financial distress, without the
need for creditor or court consent. Such moratorium prevents enforcement action by certain types of creditors in
order to make a rescue viable, and can be extended to up to a year with creditor consent, or longer by court order.
Note that the moratorium does not restrict enforcement or payment of debts due under contracts involving
financial services – this includes capital market investments.

The moratorium is a “debtor in possession” process which allows the company’s management to remain in control
of it during the process. This is overseen by an insolvency practitioner who is required to monitor the process. To
be eligible for a moratorium, the company’s management must certify that the company is, or is likely to become,
unable to pay its debts. The insolvency practioner, in its role as monitor, must also certify in its view that a
moratorium would result in the company being rescued as a going concern.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model
**Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and the UK, where it**
was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain
UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the
relevant debtor is determined to be in the UK) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be
in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in the UK) upon application by the relevant insolvency
officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been
implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if
the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if
the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention 2005”) where applicable. As of January 15, 2024,
the UK Government has signed the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the "Hague Convention 2019"), which will come into force
twelve months after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings commenced after that date. In addition,
recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008
of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations
(“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of
law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention 2005 (or the Hague Convention 2019), or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and

227


-----

restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this
point has been considered adopted the latter position).

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms
agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of
UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Until a mutual recognition agreement is reached and becomes effective, it is likely to be more problematic for UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than when the UK was a member state of the EU. The
general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules
adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the
element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in
reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be
recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of
contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member
states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state
of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and
whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**Italy**

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be
more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly-owned companies are
involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the Italian
government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the
guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a comprehensive legal
framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a
comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter _alia, insolvency matters which came into force on July_
15, 2022 (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter, as subsequently amended and
supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022 implementing the EU Directive
2019/1023 the “Italian **Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on**
February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. _Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Italian Insolvency_
Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the
replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new
definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state
of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Italian Insolvency Code; (iv) a new set of rules concerning
group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione_

228


-----

_negoziata della crisi); (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) the_
adoption of the definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning
group restructurings; (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di_
_regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early_
detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies; and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the
Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to the Business
Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian
Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022.
Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March
16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been
initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23,
published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law
June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now
effective starting from July 15, 2022.

Provisions under the Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian Bankruptcy legislation),
as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) continue to apply only to any filings for
proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare)
and any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti)
or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before
July 15, 2022 (i.e. the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code).

Please find below a brief description of the main provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry force on
July 15, 2022 which supersedes the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill
of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or
“Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as
will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold.

Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court,
based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is
defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor
is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary
status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also
introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code
as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy
of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual
situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be
activated.

In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of
crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which
may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of
a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a
state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial
imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur.

229


-----

**_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where
a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement
with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

**_Negotiated Composition for the overcoming of business’ crisis (Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della_**
**_crisi d’impresa) pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The negotiated composition for the overcoming of business’ crisis (composizione negoziata per la soluzione della
_crisi d’impresa, hereinafter the “Negotiated Composition”) was originally introduced in the Italian legal_
framework by Law Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Italian Insolvency Code. It
is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the
entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code requesting the competent court
to confirm or modify the protective measures (misure protettive, hereinafter “Protective Measures”) provided
for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code on the same day as the publication of the request in the
relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and,
if necessary, to enact the conservative measures necessary to complete the negotiations (misure conservative,
hereinafter “Interim Measures” and, together with the Protective Measures, the “Measures”), and (ii) when the
entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under
Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code (super-senior financing and transfer of the business or of a business
branch).

The Negotiated Composition is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the recovery of companies which “despite
_being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress_
_or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business_
_or a branch of it.”_

According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the Negotiated Composition can be pursued by enterprises,
either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a
distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it
is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further
deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code,
_inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a Negotiated Composition_ (i) shall certify that no judicial
liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the
procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44,
paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed and (ii) in the event that the application for
a Negotiated Composition is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested by the entrepreneur,
may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the Negotiated Composition may also apply to group of
companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be noted that paragraph 9 of such
provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the
agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools
referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group. The Negotiated
Composition is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party
and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated
electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or
liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., _procedimenti_
_di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed._
Pursuant to Article 16 of the Italian Insolvency Code the person who acted as Expert in the context of such
proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following
the termination of the negotiated proceeding.

230


-----

The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating
and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to
identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a
branch thereof.

The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/ her
own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive,
notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the Platform. In case of negative outcome, the
Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the
appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real chances of
recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by its advisors.

If the Expert finds that there are actual and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties
involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings
close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with
fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried
out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The
entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets
without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of
credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in
an informed manner, and the access to the Negotiated Composition does not, by itself, constitute ground for
suspending or revoking (or withdrawal from) overdraft facilities made available to the enterpreneur. Specific
provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts.

If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur
or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce,
which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated
if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the
Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue
up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties
involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required
by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court seeking the Measures pursuant to Article 19 and/
or pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 5, of the Insolvency Code, during the composizione negoziata della crisi the
Expert may invite the parties to re-determine, according to good faith, the terms of the contracts for continuous,
periodic performance or deferred performance if the performance on the debtor’s side has become excessively
burdensome or the contractual balance has changed as a result of intervening circumstances. The parties are
required to collaborate together to re-determine the contractual terms or to adjust the performance to the changed
circumstance.

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert
issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the
court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of
their related effects.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert,
or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may
also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The
Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting
creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions against its assets and the goods and rights used for conducting its business are
stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the composition with creditors proceedings (concordato
_preventivo), payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to_
employees’ claims

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of
conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the Negotiated Composition, the ruling of opening

231


-----

the judicial liquidation proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the
insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the
Protective Measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their
expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of
the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the
Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the
publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must
simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures
and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will
be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of
the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion
of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum
of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or
shorten their duration.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of
the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written
notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the
negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and
financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the
entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in
the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities.

If the Expert believes that an extraordinary management act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations
or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control
body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives
immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At
the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective
Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do
not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation
to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the
Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors
ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked.

Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent
that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the
creditors’ recovery, may authorize:

(i) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(ii) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’_
financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under
Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil
Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate,
taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved.
The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser.

Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the Negotiated Composition can terminate as follow:

232


-----

(i) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause
for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian
Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of
the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

(ii) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian
Insolvency Code;

(iii) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the
effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324 of the Italian Insolvency Code. With
such agreement the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to
be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above-mentioned agreements is executed, the entrepreneur may
alternatively:

(i) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The_
percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is reduced
to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the Final Report of the Expert.

(ii) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the
Italian Insolvency Code;

(iii) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided
for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(iv) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the socalled Prodi-bis procedure or the Marzano procedure (See below);

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain their
effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition_
with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding
(apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article
64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), a compulsory
administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large
insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition
with creditors agreement aimed at the liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code;_

(ii) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting
of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are consistent with the
development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in
place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made;

(iii) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted
its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the Italian
Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article
21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization
pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to
be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery
(risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal
sanctions.

**_Potential outcomes of the Negotiated Composition: the simplified composition with creditors proceedings for_**
**_liquidation purposes (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio)_**

Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code introduces a simplified court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation
composition with creditors proceedings with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio, hereinafter the “Simplified Composition”)._

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a Negotiated Composition proceeding, the Expert states that the
negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been able to reach an agreement with
its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the options provided under
Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following
the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where the entrepreneur has
its center of main interests a petition for admission to the Simplified Composition, together with a liquidation
plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for Simplified
Composition is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court.
From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency
Code apply.

Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia,
express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the
auxiliary and the Final Report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list
filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors
and any third party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court approval (omologazione) within ten
days before the date fixed for the hearing.

If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority
creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors
with respect to the alternative of a judicial liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor,
it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the Simplified Composition when it finds that (i) the
proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and the adversarial principle
among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione)
and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to
what they would receive in case of judicial liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each
creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been
notified of the same.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a preidentified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such
third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better
solutions on the market, may implement the offer.

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa proceeding,
the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been able to
reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the
options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible,
within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court
where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per
la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the
Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then_
published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such
publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced.

**_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian_**
**_Insolvency Code_**

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento,
hereinafter “Out-of-court Reorganization Plans”) addressed to the creditors and prepared by debtors who are
either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their
financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of
Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring
plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval
to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites
and qualifications set forth by Article 2, paragraph 1, letter o), namely: (i) be enrolled in the Register of Auditors
and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili); (ii) meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of
the Italian Civil Code and (iii) not be lined to the company or other parties involved in the crisis resolution
operation by personal or professional relationships. The independent expert may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

Out-of-court Reorganization Plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of
judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising
authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by
a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the
debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its financial position. However, the possibility to adopt such tools for
liquidation purposes is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness
and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation
agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the
debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or interim/precautionary actions of third-party
creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent,
the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation
of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione
_revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as_
provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (b) are exempted
from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the
Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the
independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax
benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court prejudicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the agreements
entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the
abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial liquidation, if the
competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the
independent expert.

Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth specific rules regarding Out-of-court
Reorganization Plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors in the
implementation thereof, which must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against clawback actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, Out-of-court Debt Restructuring
Plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation
representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others,
the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan.
Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor
and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before
an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being unreasonable.

**_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of_**
**_the Italian Insolvency Code_**

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti, hereinafter “Debt
**Restructuring Agreements”) provided for pursuant to Article 57 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code may be**
entered into by the debtor, also non commercial and other than the minor entrepreneur, with creditors holding at
least 60% of the outstanding indebtedness, to be sanctioned (omologato) by the competent court and are based on
a restructuring plan. An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business
and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly,
that the Debt Restructuring Agreements and the underlying restructuring plan ensure that the indebtedness vis-àvis non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i) the
date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the Debt Restructuring Agreements by the court, in the case of debts which
are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement by the court; or (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which
are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of
the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor
who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and request the court’s
sanctioning (omologazione) of the Debt Restructuring Agreement entered into with its creditors.

The Debt Restructuring Agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day
of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the
publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the
court will validate (omologare) the Debt Restructuring Agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed
within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the Debt
Restructuring Agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third party carrying
out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or
postponements of claims. The Debt Restructuring Agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule
for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments
to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the Debt Restructuring
Agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial
amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval (omologazione), the debtor shall make
such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the Debt Restructuring Agreements, by
requesting the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57,
paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the
amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the
creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the
abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

_The key features of a Debt Restructuring Agreement_

With the petition for the approval by the court of the Debt Restructuring Agreement (or at any time pending the
procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any Protective Measures, e.g. a stay of actions or the creation by
creditors of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing
debts, etc. Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for
approval of the Debt Restructuring Agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for
by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided
that the petition for approval of the Debt Restructuring Agreement includes the relevant request for Measures,
from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue
any enforcement or interim/conservative actions against the assets of the debtors or the goods or rights used for
conducting its business (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No
dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a Debt Restructuring Agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial

236


-----

commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation
are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions.

It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the
proceedings are generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are
not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests
otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, unless the exception provided
for Debt Restructuring Agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia estesa) provided
pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies (see below).

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing
to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors and
other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any
opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into Debt Restructuring
Agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same
category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal position and economic interests) and can request the court
to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram
down”).

More in detail, Debt Restructuring Agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia
_estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code- which were previously only permitted in_
relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total
indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, _inter alia: (i) all the creditors_
belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate
in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and
financial situation as well as on the Debt Restructuring Agreement and its effects; (ii) the Debt Restructuring
Agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article
84 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category
represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category, being understood that a creditor may hold
claims in more than one category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the
effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the
amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more
than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the
documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the
debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations
pertaining to the Negotiated Composition.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is set
forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the Debt
Restructuring Agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial
intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the
agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is
valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern.
However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di
_moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the_
non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under
Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the
business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii)
the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the
context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the
relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to participate
in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and
financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can
challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

237


-----

In no case Debt Restructuring Agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and
standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering
creditors, inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of
the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so called facilitated Debt Restructuring
Agreements (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring
agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead
of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the
debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for
a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations,
in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of Measures
on its assets and/or waives to such Measures.

By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors
that have adhered to the Debt Restructuring Agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims
towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors
by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, Debt Restructuring Agreements produce effect
towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such
shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

The provision of Articles 99, 101 and 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code on super-senior financing (Finanziamenti
_Prededucibili) apply to both Debt Restructuring Agreements and to the court-supervised compositions with_
creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the approval (omologa),
the court, upon the debtor's petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial liquidation procedure. If the revocation
results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under the debt
restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public prosecutor.
In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the documentation
and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Court supervised Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared insolvent
by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to
compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and
the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo,” hereinafter “Court-supervised
**Composition with Creditors”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which**
exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount
exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess
(included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a Courtsupervised Composition with Creditors before the court based in the location of the debtor’s main office. The
debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description
of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility
of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company).
The petition for Court-supervised Composition with Creditors is then published by the debtor in the company’s
register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication
to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo (omologa), preexisting creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date
on which the petition for the Court-supervised Composition with Creditors is published in the company’s register
are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency
Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the Court-supervised Composition with Creditors
proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the
companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or,
in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference
to Debt Restructuring Agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted

238


-----

Measures, which can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a prepetition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment
of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20%
of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting
to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into
shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the
operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the organisation of creditors into classes
(which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that
each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different
treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article
109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of
a Court-supervised Composition with Creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan
may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of
sanctioning (omologa) of the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori
_privilegiati),_ unless it is envisaged the liquidation of the assets encumbered by the relevant security interests, with
the exception of the repayment of secured creditors pursuant to Article 2751-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Civil
Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.) for which the standstill cannot exceed a period of 6 months from the
validation (omologazione) of the concordato preventivo.

The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor
as going concern; or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con continuità
_aziendale) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets that are no_
longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84,
paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _concordato misto qualifies as a_ _concordato con continuità_
_aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan and_
the petition for the _concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a_
consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support
which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the
business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal
was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be
terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the liquidation
of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an offer
for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court
or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire
competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by
decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4,
the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing
that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements for the
participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use,
(e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the manner
in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be
provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (l)
the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with
the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and
the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the
proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding.

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the
unsecured creditors, a Court-supervised Composition with Creditors proposal with liquidation purpose

239


-----

(concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the
creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the
relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the
time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the unsecured creditors (either originally unsecured or unsecured due
to the write-off of their secured claims) are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect,
it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with
liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under
Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20%
requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by
the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan provides
them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors
proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

Under the Court-supervised Composition with Creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly
retains management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the
deputy judge (giudice delegato). From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court
sanctions the _concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business,_
although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the
abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim
measures sought by the creditors, whose claim accrued prior to the filing of the petition by the debtor, are stayed.
The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens,
mortgages or privileges (privilege). Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by
the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act,_
payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance
with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy
criminal offences provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple
bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the
Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code
upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super
senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial liquidation (see Statutory priorities below).

For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the paragraph relating to debt restructuring agreements.

The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and_
simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian
Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilised by the debtor also to access a Debt Restructuring
Agreement or a restructuring plan subject to approval by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) or a_ _concordato preventivo. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to_
submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation (or the Debt Restructuring Agreement,
or the restructuring plan subject to approval by the court, piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)
within a period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary
petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for
such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are not
pending. If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial
commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried
out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets,
omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent
acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato
_preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period._
As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures.

Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

240


-----

Non-compliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon
request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the
adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor company
appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, ex officio, after
hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional
documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the Courtsupervised Composition with Creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary
activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the
extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of
the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case
of a subsequent judicial liquidation.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going
_concern basis:_

(i) the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a loan
agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that:
(a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the Court-supervised Composition with
Creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for principal
and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph
3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the
business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by
Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the
proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the
installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors;

(ii) the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the
application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation
is envisaged under the plan, if an Expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to
ensure the best satisfaction of creditors (such Expert’s certificate is not necessary if the payment if made
with funds made available to the entrepreneur on a non-refundable basis or subordinated to the prior
satisfaction of the creditors); and

(iii) the court may authorize the payment of pre-filing claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an
independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction
of creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific
period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the
company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is
supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the
ordinary course of business).

The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court (which, pursuant to Article
104, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code is doubled in the presence of noteholders) and must be approved
with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also
in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to
vote is reached the majority of the classes (in case of concordato preventivo for liquidation purposes) or all the
classes (in case of concordato preventivo on a going concern basis). Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the
Italian Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is
also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The _concordato preventivo is approved only if the required_
majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right
will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes
in the _concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with_
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings
of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has

241


-----

however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case
of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit
in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and
to the extent they waive their security, or the _concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full_
satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert),
in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i)
the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling
the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected
during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting.

Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, the concordato preventivo on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità aziendale), is approved if
all the creditors’ classes vote in favor. In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved
if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting
creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class
have voted. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in
cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con continuità and provided that
the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-up, functional to their
satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court.

However, if one or more classes voted against, pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code
the court may still validate (omologare) the concordato preventivo if the following conditions are jointly fulfilled:

  - the liquidation value of the entrepreneur is distributed in accordance with the statutory priority rules;

  - the value generated by the proceedings exceeding the liquidation value is distributed in such a way that
the claims included in the dissenting classes receive overall treatment at least equal to that of the classes
of the same rank and more favorable than that of the classes of a lower rank;

  - no creditor receives more than the amount of its claim;

  - the proposal is approved by a majority of the classes, provided that at least one of them consists of secured
creditors rights, or, failing that, the proposal is approved by at least one class of creditors who would be
at least partially satisfied respecting the statutory priority rules on the value exceeding the liquidation
value.

If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there
are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to vote, the court may
nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be_
satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case (including
the judicial liquidation).

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social
contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is
decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient or not
detrimental compared to a judicial liquidation scenario.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except
for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of
the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a Court-supervised Composition
with Creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in
particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a Negotiated_
Composition provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code.

242


-----

Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the _concordato_
_preventivo proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or_
more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In
such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the
plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial
liquidation scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints
one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets.
The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not
cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo,
the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the appropriate
conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by
the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending
the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements
(contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent
with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which
are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato),
residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad
_uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with_
the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo or to the judge_
(giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the
pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing
of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are
reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation
proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have
been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may
not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In
such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered
for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission
to the concordato preventivo procedure.

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with
creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the _concordato can be terminated or_
annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial winding-up may follow,
at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of
payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the
assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to
the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their
rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the _concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial_
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within
one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.
The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in
case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The
relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in
any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the
_concordato itself._

**_Available financing forms under the Italian Insolvency Code_**

The enactment of the Italian Insolvency Code did not change the main features of the previous legal framework
set out in the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and

243


-----

maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian
Insolvency Code.

However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some
debated issues.

In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors
already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced
due to the potential considerable increase in pre-deductible claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role
to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework,
the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business value of the distressed
company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the
relevant proceedings.

The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both Debt Restructuring Agreement and to
the Court-supervised Compositions with Creditors (concordato preventivo).

The main features of the provisions concerning different available financings under the Italian Insolvency Code
are set out below.

_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring
transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a
view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of
the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the Court-supervised Composition with Creditors procedure described
below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure
such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims,
provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable
prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified
the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing
are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologa) of the relevant insolvency
proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a
better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that
there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the
subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition or
the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of
the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings
to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims)
granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a
Debt Restructuring Agreement or a Court-Supervised Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)
(finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99,
paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such
priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning
(omologazione) of the Debt Restructuring Agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The_
indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security
(garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

_Implementation financing - Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any
financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a Debt Restructuring Agreement (or a Court-supervised Composition
with Creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super

244


-----

senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below, according
with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission
of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not
enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring
agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon
false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in
_frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had_
knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_The shareholders' financing – Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 102, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status (prededuzione)
also applies to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or
granting counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made
available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition
with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior
ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in Paragraph 1 does not apply.

_Super senior ranking - Articles 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Super senior ranking (prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim
financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly
qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super
senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings
(including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of
fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one
side and for the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are
relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the
independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan
underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code
provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in
the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior
ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

  - the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when
the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

  - the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of the
Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the
opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

  - when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the
proceeding, the plan underlying the Court-supervised Composition with Creditors or the Debt
Restructuring Agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information;
or

245


-----

  - when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders
providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the
financings.

**_Restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_**

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian
Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione
_soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called “PRO,” the rules of which are set out in the new Articles 64-bis,64-ter_
and 64-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool, takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular
insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be
noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its
creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This
instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio
_creditorum” (i.e. the equal treatment of creditors) and statutory priority rules, provided that the proposal is_
approved by unanimous consent of the classes (where the rules on voting are the same as those provide for the
Court-supervised Composition with Creditors). A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which
is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework
applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. concordato preventivo, Debt Restructuring Agreement
and also to judicial liquidation). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is_
based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary
management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court
commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal
of Court-supervised Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval
is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for Court-supervised Composition with Creditors
may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made
before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is
reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that
creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the
restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court
will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than
the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its
observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a
cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione
_soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity which minimizes the admissibility phase,_
providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively
approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the PRO subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of appeal within_
the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

**_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_**

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not
meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the concordato preventivo, but it entails the involvement
of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di composizione della crisi), which assists the debtor in preparing
the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a concordato preventivo are
prerogatives of the judicial commissioner.

**_Judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)_**

The judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent
enterpreneur’s assets and for the distribution of the related proceeds. It results in the enterpreneur’s liquidation.
Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external
elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due.

The judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the enterpreneur (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_
had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to
Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s
assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control
and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain
cases, by the public prosecutor.

Upon the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, amongst other things:

(i) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the
secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of
the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank _pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured_
creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge
(giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge
decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

(ii) under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors
may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore)
and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant
timing in his or her decision;

(iii) the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or
received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have
been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor
(Articles 144 and 145 of Italian Insolvency Code);

(iv) the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are
transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant
or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver
is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending
proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is
issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver;

(v) the beginning of the judicial liquidation involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a
view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the
continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court
authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the
business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for
this purpose);

(vi) certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain
period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial liquidation procedure (varying from six months to two
years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant to Article
166 of the Italian Insolvency Code);

247


-----

(vii) any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain
cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those
made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

(viii) the performance of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule
is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the
obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules
expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code.

In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written
petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within
such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the
deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is
deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where
some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly
provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code.

Judicial liquidation proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are
carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a
creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and
is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the
liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property.

Furthermore, the parties of a judicial liquidation proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal
(opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified
of the same.

**_Composition with creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)._**

Pursuant to Article 240 of the Italian Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to the
actual judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the debtor, through a proposal for a composition with
creditors in judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, hereinafter “Judicial Liquidation
**Composition”). By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation**
proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare,” a composition with creditors
agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article
124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the Court-supervised
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo), which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This
particular composition with creditor agreement arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as
the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free
disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full
completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets.

The creditor, a third party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy
creditors, including secured creditors, in full or in part. In case the Judicial Liquidation Composition is proposed
by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the
debtor’s assets by at least 10%.

Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by
the court. In case the court’s decree approving the Judicial Liquidation Composition becomes final (definitivo),
the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the Judicial
Liquidation Composition. In the context of a Judicial Liquidation Composition, the competent court supervises
both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses
his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions
of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the aforementioned Judicial Liquidation
Composition.

248


-----

Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for:

(i) the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests.

Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for
the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and
(b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the
criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use
of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned
proposal;

(ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such
differences;

(iii) the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any form
possible, by way of example:

a) by assignment of assets;

b) by assumption (accollo);

c) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to
companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible
into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities.

It should be noted that a special feature of the Judicial Liquidation Composition is the option to provide that
secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their
satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of statutory priority rules,
from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable
to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists.

The Judicial Liquidation Composition proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value)
of the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s
class, a cram-down may occur (i.e. in case the court decides to approve the Judicial Liquidation Composition

   - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that
the claims can be satisfied by the Judicial Liquidation Composition to a non-lesser extent than the practicable
alternatives. Final court confirmation and sanctioning (omologazione) is also required.

Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the Judicial Liquidation Composition is
mandatory:

(i) for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and

(ii) for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the

guarantees or the security interests given in the Judicial Liquidation Composition by third parties do not
extend.

With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di
_omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed_
within 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its
assets.

     - _Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code_
may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU
jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules of statutory
priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based
on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments
such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable
against an Italian bankruptcy / insolvency estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are

249


-----

derived from the sale of the entire entrepreneur’s estate or part thereof or from a single asset. The
rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the
entire entrepreneur’s estate or part thereof or from a single asset.

The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of
“predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to
the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (ii) for payment of
claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of
unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the
proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose
priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian
tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining
priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati;
a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages
(creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti
_chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed_
according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority
rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such
as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable
against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing
the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly
qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are
“prededucibili”:

(i) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement
body;

(ii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation, the Debt Restructuring Agreements and for the
application for Protective Measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided
that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated;

(iii) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a Court-supervised
Composition with Creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and
theplan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided
that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iv) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the
debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from
the professional services required by the related bodies.

- _Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal_
treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities
or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A
consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly
regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain
cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential.

Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian
law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests
made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but
are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions
made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered
to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial liquidation compared to the rules applicable in
other jurisdictions.

250


-----

In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides
for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year
ineffectiveness period for certain payments and other transactions. In the context of extraordinary
administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five
years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or
transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at
the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

  - _Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to_
certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening
of the judicial liquidation procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such
insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article
163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon
registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without
needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested
person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under
Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the
debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation
proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any
intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial liquidation declaration (or after the filing of
the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors.

  - _Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following_
acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back
(revocati) vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be
declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or potential
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) transactions for consideration carried out after the filing of the petition for the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the
obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received
by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by
other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing of the petition for
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which
were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the
judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing debts
which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any transactions for consideration
and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (even those of third
parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other
party knew (or should have known) the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing
of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months.

Pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the following transactions are exempted
from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

251


-----

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce
the entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian
Civil Code, in force as the date of this Offering Memorandum (provided that the effectiveness
of the relevant registration has not ceased), made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family
(within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat
of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration,
the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such
activity have been carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees or security interests granted with
respect to the debtor’s assets, provided that they concern the implementation of a _piano_
_attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court Reorganization Plans,_ _piani attestati di_
_risanamento pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the
context of a Court-Supervised Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo), of a
restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad
_omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of_
sanctioned Debt Restructuring Agreements with creditors _(accordi di ristrutturazione dei_
_debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests_
legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a Court-Supervised
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or of a Debt Restructuring Agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti, see above);

(vi) remuneration payments to the debtor’s employees and consultants concerning work carried
out by them; and

(vii) payments of debts due and payable, made on the due date, with respect to services necessary
for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring frameworks "strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza
_della società") or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the Italian_
Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back
action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier,
five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced
after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170,
paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date
in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that
certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five
years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article
2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the entity disposed
of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to
the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the
debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into
for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the
transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group
transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intragroup claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to
the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for
judicial liquidation declaration.

252


-----

Law no. 132 of August, 62015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code,
providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of
transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment
by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back or nullifying the relevant
(fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration
(e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo_
_patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be_
carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency
Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private
international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**_Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures._**

One of the main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational,
administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of
the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of
crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires
the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian
Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of
suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned
Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency
Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be
necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of “adequate structures.”

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to
which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the
crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that,
for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be
adequate should make it possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for
the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test
for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian
Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows:

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total
monthly payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount

greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due

for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at
least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures;
and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25
novies of the Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Common rules for pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e_**
**_dell’insolvenza della società)_**

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120-bis and
ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-judicial
liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza). Among other things,
pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful
restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company,
_including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other_
_modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and_
_transformations.” Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering_
the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation
and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for
the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian
Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related
legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders
representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal, within a
Court-supervised Composition with Creditors.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to
whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan.
The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the
shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital.
In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of
the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then
provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages
shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value.

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to
avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision
expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring
tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in
relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not
require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from
the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_
agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one
of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) aiming
at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and
(iii) subordination of claims. In particular, multiple companies in crisis or insolvency belonging to the same group
(each having its center of main interest in Italy) can utilize the Composition with Creditors or a Debt Restructuring
Agreement by filing a single petition and on the basis of a single plan for all the group companies or different
plans mutually linked if this results in a better recovery for the creditors of each company, in comparison with the
recovery that they would theoretically get if each company proposes a separate plan. This requirement shall be
assessed taking into account the individual interests of the creditors of each company, in compliance with the
principle of separation of assets and liabilities, which prevents the creditors of a company to be satisfied with the
assets of another company.

However, the Italian Insolvency Code contemplates few exceptions to the principle of separation of assets and
liabilities: the plan underlying the Composition with Creditors or the Debt Restructuring Agreement may envisage
contractual and reorganization transactions, including intra-group transfers of resources, provided that an Expert
certifies that such transactions are necessary (i) for the continuation of the business of the companies pursuant to
the plan and (ii) are consistent with the aim of optimizing recovery for the creditors of all group companies.

254


-----

Dissenting creditors and shareholders may challenge such intra-group transfers of resources. However, in spite of
such a challenge being made, the court can rule to sanction (omologare) the Composition with Creditors or the
Debt Restructuring Agreement it if the following additional conditions are met:

  - in case of a challenge by creditors, the court considers, on the basis of an overall assessment of the plan
or linked plans, that the creditors can obtain a recovery of their receivables equal or better than what they
would obtain in judicial liquidation proceedings of the company; and

  - in case of challenge by shareholders, if the court – on the basis of the group plan – excludes the
occurrence of an impairment of the value and profitability of their shareholdings in light of the
countervailing benefits arising to the individual companies involved.

**_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_**

In a judicial winding-up proceeding, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two
years (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request
that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back
period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Notes and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator
or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back
(revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period.
The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the
opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation,
at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the
value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment
in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered
into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge
of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect
period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the
opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent
creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into,
and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously
to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the judicial
receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is
commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170,
paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such
petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a
Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or
security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection
with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts
under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions,
all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by
the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or
within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction
which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate
by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding,
without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested
person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164

255


-----

of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration
of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application
followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year
period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a
judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up
proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the insolvent entity
disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the insolvent entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the
date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the insolvent entity
for the purpose of prejudicing the insolvent entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for
consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered
into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design).
The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”
clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/
nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo_
_patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_
the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

**_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must
be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in
the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its
assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its
last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public
prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial liquidation proceedings with respect to existing contracts and
creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to
those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the debtor meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale)
to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial
receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of
Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the
procedure or place it into judicial liquidation.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either
for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal
**Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless**
extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato,
_e.g. a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the debtor have been_
transferred, etc.). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary

256


-----

commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial
condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon
successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company
will be declared insolvent.

**_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_**
**_insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative
phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal
Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed
within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved
by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up proceedings.

Law Decree No. 4/2024 amended Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Decree 347/2003, providing that in cases of
companies directly or indirectly owned by state public administrations (excluding those issuing shares listed on
regulated stock exchanges), admission to the Marzano procedure of companies operating one or more industrial
plants having a national strategic relevance may occur upon request of shareholders holding, individually or
jointly, at least 30 per cent of the company's shares, provided that the shareholders have communicated to the
managing body of the company that the requirements for the admission to the procedure are met and the managing
body of the company has either failed to submit the application for the admission to the procedure within the
subsequent fifteen days or within the same fifteen days’ term refused to file the petition in question. From the
date of submission of the request by the shareholders, and until the closure of the Marzano procedure or until the
court's decision declaring the absence of the requirements for the opening of the procedure becomes final, the
company cannot pursue any restructuring proceedings provided for by the Code. A company cannot be admitted
to the Marzano Procedure where a petition to commence a Negotiated Composition has been previously filed.

**_Compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), provided for under Article 293 and
ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code, is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies,
insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant
to judicial liquidation proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private
sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated
not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active.
The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds
expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities
concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory
provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore)
is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato
_di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other insolvency_
proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced
administrative liquidation on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for

257


-----

example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for insolvency proceedings with respect to
existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.

**_Limitations on Granting Guarantees and Security Interests under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its bylaws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and
certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of
an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be
triggered.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive
a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company.
The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined
by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the
statutory auditors, if any.

As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis,
although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company
belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for down-stream security interest or
guarantee (i.e., a security interest or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of directly or indirectly
owned subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of upstream or
cross-stream security interest or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of
the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity incorporated under
the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest
or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive real and adequate benefits
or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an
Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to
it. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream security or guarantee for the financial obligations of
group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions
to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether
and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest.

As a general rule, the absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a
security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict
of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject
matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a
court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the
corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate
benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising
control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control.
Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or the guarantee granted by an Italian company) could
be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party
and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream and down-stream guarantees granted by
Italian companies.

In addition, the granting of a security or guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription
by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian
company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of
its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial

258


-----

assistance provisions. Any loan, security or guarantee given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and
void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

In addition, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is
issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such
maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the
guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum
guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the Italian
guarantor. It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If
such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the Guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

In any event, pursuant to and for the sole purposes of article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code and without prejudice
to the other limitations indicated below, the maximum amount, that an Italian guarantor may be required to pay
in respect of its obligations as a guarantor under its Guarantee, must be provided and, in the case at issue, such
cap is set at €525 million, representing 150% of the aggregate amount of the Notes.

In order to comply with corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under
the Indenture, the indenture relating to the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and and/or
the UKEF Facilities Agreement will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an
Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

In particular, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit (including Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian
Civil Code), notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture and the indenture relating to the
Existing Notes:

(i) the Guarantee (and security interests, if any) granted by the each Italian Guarantor in respect of the Notes
shall not exceed at any time (and in aggregate) an amount equal to the principal amount of any
intercompany loan or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not
including equity contributions) made available at any time to that Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian civil code) out of the proceeds of the Notes
(whether directly or indirectly), as outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee (and/or the
relevant security interest), in each case net of any proceeds already paid by it pursuant to the enforcement
of its guarantee under the Notes and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by
it; _provided further that none of the Italian Guarantors shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any_
amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation
(regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by it under its Guarantee;

(ii) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes documents, any guarantee, indemnity,
obligations (including, without limitation, any security obligations) and liability granted or assumed
pursuant to the Notes by an Italian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend, directly or indirectly,
to any amount the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition or
subscription, directly or indirectly, of the shares or quotas in such Italian Guarantor or any direct or indirect
controlling entity of such Italian Guarantor and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp,
registration or other taxes in connection therewith (or to refinance any indebtedness incurred for such
purposes) or to any obligations incurred by any other guarantor under any guarantee given by such other
guarantor for the same purposes, so as to exclude any case of undue financial assistance pursuant to article
2358 and/or 2474 of the Italian Civil Code;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by each Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with Article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 150% of the outstanding principal
amount of the Notes;

259


-----

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by each Italian
Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the
Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by it at that time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the
Italian Civil Code and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993), the
obligations of each Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any
interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or Article
120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, respectively.

It is understood that the maximum amount that the Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations
as Guarantor under the Indenture will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by
such Guarantor to any guaranteed creditor pursuant the indenture relating to the Existing Notes and any other
financing arrangements ranking pari passu with the Notes and from which the Italian Guarantors do not have
direct benefit (including, as applicable, the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the UKEF Facilities), and vice versa.
For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantee (and/or the
security interests, if any) granted by the Italian Guarantors, the obligations of the Italian Guarantors as Guarantors
(and/or security providers, as the case may be) under the Notes, the Indenture, the indenture relating to the Existing
Notes, the Existing Notes, and any other financing arrangements ranking _pari passu with the Notes and from_
which the Italian Guarantors do not have direct benefit (including, as applicable, the Revolving Credit Facility
and/or the UKEF Facilities) and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be
cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the
aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/ or security
obligations of the Italian Guarantors shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the Italian Guarantors’
credit support out of the proceeds of the Notes, the Existing Notes and any other financing arrangements ranking
pari passu with the Notes and from which the Italian Guarantors do not have direct benefit (including, as
applicable, the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the UKEF Facilities).

However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts
under such Guarantees, as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior
indebtedness of such Guarantor. In addition, the proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees will be distributed
among the guaranteed creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under
the relevant Guarantees.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree of 1 September 1993, No. 385, as amended (the “Italian
**Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non**
compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among other things, entail the relevant guarantees
being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing
Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security by a
company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted
financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of
Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies that are under the control of the same entity. As a
result of the above-described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group
of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Trust and parallel debt_**

It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest or guarantee can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of
“trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and

260


-----

powers of a “trustee” as agent or trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under
Italian law.

Given the above, to the extent that the holders of Notes are not party to the security documents (if any) governed
by Italian law, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of Notes (in relation to which the
relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of
enforcement) are not secured by any security interests (if any) created under the security documents governed by
Italian law or cannot enforce such security interests.

**_Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Granting Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any payment made by the
borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial liquidation declaration are ineffective
by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according
to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the
terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian
_Insolvency Laws Considerations—Judicial Winding-Up (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening_
_Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” above. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian_
Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the
entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising
them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial liquidation or in
the year before, are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such
provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its
shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of
such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as
_società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian
subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the
obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards
other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed
subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer
may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes
is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any guarantees and/or
security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests and guarantees by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process
in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals

261


-----

of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security
interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the
appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or
avoidance or clawback of Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or
clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the
terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Judicial Winding-Up
_(liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. If challenged_
successfully, the guarantee or security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be
refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interests or guarantee is voided, holders
of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts
under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have
a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interests, guarantee and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform
its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the
Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be
or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria)
and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public
policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal
concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive
such judgment might not be held to do so;

262


-----

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- in general, under Italian law contracts can be declared null and void (nullo (Article 1418 of the Italian
Civil Code) or annullabile (Article 1425 of the Italian Civil Code));

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid,
not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save
those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code). Furthermore, contracts may be
terminated for breach (Article 1453 of the Italian Civil Code), supervening impediment (Article 1463 of
the Italian Civil Code) or excessive onerousness (Article 1467 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the
supervision of the court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual
foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay).
Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is
expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned
at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure or attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure
or attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover,
to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of
the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or judicial liquidation;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data
_certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a_
document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one
of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document.
Furthermore, the requirement for an instrument of bearing an undisputable date (data certa) is requested
in order to oppose the instrument and the rights deriving thereby to a bankruptcy estate;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation guaranteed or secured by an Italian company,
which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, _inter alia, any_
obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under

263


-----

the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and
related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any
compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal
proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for
not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120
of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as
a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

- in the case of judicial liquidation of the grantor of a pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by
the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant proceeding or in case of a
judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value
and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the
pledged quotas or shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee,
security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets or, accordingly with the
circumstances of the case, from the date when the plaintiff could enforce his/her right, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a
declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act
that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed
for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all
or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already been made
under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the
court found that, inter alia:

- the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or
future creditors or with the intent of giving undue preference to certain creditors over others, or when the
beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant
guarantee;

- the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee
or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

- the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in
the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

264


-----

- the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to
the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to
the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors (Synthomer Deutschland GmbH) is organized under the laws of Germany, has its registered
office in Germany and substantially all of its tangible assets are located in Germany. Consequently, any insolvency
proceedings with regard to this Guarantor is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the Guarantor was held to
have its COMI within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would in principle govern such
proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including,
inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of
the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes and
Guarantees, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Pursuant to
the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of
the European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be
in a member state other than Germany (see—”European Union”). This is to be determined at the time when the
insolvency filing is made.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if
any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The German legislator
adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von
_Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for_
coordination of insolvency proceedings of group companies and corporation between insolvency courts and
administrators. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group
companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order
to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group
entity insolvency proceeding (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency
administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on
insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency
administrator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) who may submit a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval
by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht).

Under German insolvency law, (preliminary) insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent
insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings (Antrag _auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). (Preliminary) insolvency proceedings_
must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung)
of the debtor or in the event that the debtor illiquid, i.e., is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is overindebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation
of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis
period covering the next twelve months (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed
illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks,

265


-----

unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can
be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock
corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—
_SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having_
an individual as personally liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the
management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after illiquidity occurred
and six weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to
both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness
occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, as applicable, may be voidable. In addition,
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists
if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue
to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period of (typically) the next 24 months. However, only
the debtor, but not a creditor, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in that
case.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court
will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the
debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the
debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided, inter alia, that no circumstances are known which lead to the
expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the creditors at a disadvantage.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the insolvency court if the debtor satisfies at least two of the_
following three requirements:

- a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

- revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding
the filing; and/or

- 50 or more employees on an annual average basis.

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other
group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions
taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the
selection of a (preliminary) insolvency administrator or (preliminary) custodian and orders for (preliminary)
debtor-in-possession status.

In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual as (preliminary)
insolvency administrator, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible;
_i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests_
of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one
for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the
preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which
may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency
reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to_
cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient,
the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the

266


-----

costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will
be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the
same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a
debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right
to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual
appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and_
amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator
and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and
impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to
continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as
preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an
unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the
available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the
German insolvency regime would be the following:

- unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of the assets of the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

- unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Guarantor or
any of its relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the Guarantor or such
subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

- If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor
in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part
of the Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings;

- claims against the Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with
the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code; and

- all creditors, whether secured or unsecured, who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings
and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims during the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions under the German
Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by
any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and,
if so ordered by a court, with respect to assets other than real estate also between the time when an
insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence).

If a German Guarantor, having its center of main interests within the territory of Germany, grants security over
its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of
such other creditors’ secured claims with respect to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant
collateral in insolvency proceedings upon the estate of the German subsidiary. In contrast, the claims of the holders
of the Notes under a Guarantee granted by the German Guarantor would be qualified as an unsecured insolvency
claim in the German Guarantor’s insolvency. Whether and to what extent an insolvency dividend can be
distributed to the unsecured insolvency creditors (such as the holder of the Notes) depends on the size of the
insolvency estate and the amount of the claims registered within the list of creditors. In addition, it may take
several years until an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors (whereas advanced
distributions to the secured creditors are generally allowed). Alternatively, a different distribution of enforcement

267


-----

proceeds and/or the insolvency estate could be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that may be
submitted by the relevant debtor or the relevant insolvency administrator. Such insolvency plan may provide for
measures deviating from regular insolvency proceedings in terms of conducting the procedure as well as
realization and distribution of the insolvency estate.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law
or are justified after a balancing of interest (Interessenabwägung). This may also relate to agreements that are not
governed by German law. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships
cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute
part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must
be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) or are preferred
creditors (Massegläubiger)) who wish to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the
insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—
in principle—subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered
by a court, also during preliminary insolvency proceedings). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient
assets are available).

German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability of secured creditors with preferential rights to
enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator
will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the
initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type
of security.

Thus, the insolvency administrator in particular has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as (ii) to collect any
claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is
vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i)
assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets
(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT
(if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims.

Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan.
However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it
by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the
debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which
has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of
authoritative case law, it is currently uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement
process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency
estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of
the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds.
Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.

268


-----

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, shareholder loans and claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan (unless privileged)), while claims of a person who becomes a
creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the
claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings
(nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including
the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated
_Claims.”_

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ assets
will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going
concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Guarantor or any of its relevant
subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval
of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—
be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership
rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including
a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or overindebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can
prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant
a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this
period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under
these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The
debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the
insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously
not competent or impartial).

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession status, the
custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are detrimental to insolvency
creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of main insolvency proceedings during applicable
claw-back periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency
administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will
have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, the Guarantor or any
of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts
to the holders of the Notes (including under a Guarantee) as well as the granting of collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an
insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In
the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to
recover or retain any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been made under the Notes or a
Guarantee, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured
claim under the Notes or a Guarantee, without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of
a Guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be
voided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing

269


-----

of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act was taken (i) during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
at such time or (iii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental
to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such
detrimental effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (or of circumstances that
compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the
debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction (or had knowledge of circumstances
that compellingly suggest filing);

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a thirdparty debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing
its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of
such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge
by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact
that the creditor agreed on a payment plan (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the debtor or granted other forms
of deferred payments terms (Zahlungserleichterung) establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge
of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party of the debtor that
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded
earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the
contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions
that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who
are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

- any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year

270


-----

prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition; or

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was
liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the
debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case
may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor,
or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction
(kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the
preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency
creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred
payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency
creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to an “affiliated
party” of the debtor, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may
as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg)
by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel)
could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to
the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary
to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor
exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

**_Pre-insolvency restructuring procedure_**

The Law on the Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und
_Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen – StaRUG or Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act) which_
became effective on January 1, 2021 provides for the implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on Preventive
Restructuring Frameworks (Restructuring Directive) into German law. It closes the gap between the possibility
of out-of-court restructuring, which requires unanimity consent by the creditors, and formal insolvency
proceedings. It creates the possibility of restructuring the liabilities of the debtor and certain security for preferred
satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) as well as the debtor's shares outside insolvency proceedings and against the
will of individual creditors/stakeholders (similar to the insolvency plan procedure, which requires a majority
decision by the stakeholder based on the respective classes of stakeholders). The core element of the StaRUG is
the restructuration plan which is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities/shares via a restructuring
plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities,
covenants or a debt-to-equity swap.

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s
liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including the Notes), or only selected liabilities.

The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review
and/or supervision by a court. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of
certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the

271


-----

competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even
be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The court is only
involved if the company makes use of procedural assistance or wants to intervene in creditors’ rights against the
resistance of the minority. This enables the parties to reduce the involvement of courts significantly and the
restructuring may take place in a largely private process.

Companies are already able to make use of the restructuring plan at an early stage outside of formal insolvency
proceedings if there is an imminent illiquidity (i.e. imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its
debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months). The debtor’s management is
not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor
may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under
“—Insolvency.”).

A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the
required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The approval of individual creditor groups requires, in
principle, the consent of 75% of the votes of the creditors within the respective voting class. However, if more
than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor
class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms
the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of
the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by the German Guarantor
would be the following:

  - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review and/or supervision by a court;

  - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up
to eight months due to a stabilization order;

  - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the
restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest; or a
deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the
security right);

  - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring
proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the
Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any
of the holders of the Notes.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date
when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other
claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking
with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day
of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their
participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as
such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money;
(iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such
a loan.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_**

The granting of guarantees by the German Guarantor will be subject to certain German capital maintenance rules
of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (the “GmbHG”) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a_

272


-----

German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—a “GmbH”) or a German limited
partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a “GmbH & Co. KG”). As a general
rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability
reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the amount
of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced.
Guarantees and any collateral granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct
or indirect parent or affiliate of a (direct or indirect) shareholder are considered disbursements under Sections 30
and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or affiliate of a (direct or indirect) shareholder without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and
to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements,
indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries
incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation
language,” the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to (subject to certain exemptions) enforce the
guarantees against the German subsidiary only if (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable if)
and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in
the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Guarantees by the Guarantor under the Indenture, will
contain such contractual limitation language and such Guarantees will be limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the Guarantees by the Guarantor cannot be enforced at all or the holders of the
Notes would have to release such enforcement proceeds.

Further, section 15b para. 5 sentence 1 German Insolvency Code restricts payments if and to the extent such
payments under any Guarantee would lead to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the German Guarantor.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings
may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German Guarantor constituted in the form of a
GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes
or of the German Guarantor to make payments on the related Guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a
shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied
by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount
of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and
anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting
of guarantees by the German Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of
the stated share capital of the grantor of the guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for
example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors
of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present
if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee
and/or collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**Malaysia**

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The corporate insolvency regime in Malaysia is mainly governed by the Companies Act 2016 of Malaysia (“CA
**2016”), which came into force in stages from 31 January 2017, replacing the previous Companies Act 1965 after**
51 years. The main corporate insolvency processes or restructuring processes in Malaysia includes schemes of
arrangement, corporate voluntary arrangement, judicial management and liquidation/winding up.

273


-----

_Winding Up_

Under the CA 2016, the court can wind up a company on a number of grounds, for example, where the company
is unable to pay its debts, where the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in the directors’ own interest
rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or have acted in any other manner which appears to be unfair
or unjust to members, or where the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound
up. If a winding-up order is made, the court will appoint a liquidator to oversee the liquidation process. Any
disposition of property (other than a disposition made by a liquidator), including any transfer of shares, alteration
in the status of the members of the company, or any attachment, sequestration, distress or execution put in force
against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of winding-up is void, unless the court orders
otherwise.

A voluntary winding-up can either be a members’ or creditors’ winding-up. In a members’ winding-up, the
shareholders can voluntarily wind up their own company if the company is solvent. First, the directors of the
company must make a statutory declaration in the prescribed form that the company is solvent and that it will be
able to pay its debts in full for the next 12 months following the commencement of winding-up. Directors of the
company must have reasonable grounds on which to base their declaration. Following the declaration of solvency,
an extraordinary general meeting is convened to enable the shareholders to pass a special resolution to wind up
the company. The shareholders will appoint a liquidator at this meeting. Once a liquidator is appointed, the
directors’ powers will cease and any transfer of shares or any alteration in the status of members not sanctioned
by the liquidator will be void. Once all these steps have been taken, the company must cease to carry on its
business (except where the liquidator is of the opinion that continuing activities will benefit the winding-up).

If the liquidator subsequently discovers that the company is insolvent, the liquidator must convert the members’
voluntary winding-up into a creditors’ winding-up.

In a creditors’ winding-up, an extraordinary general meeting of the company’s members must be called, followed
by a special creditors’ meeting to formalise the liquidation and the choice of liquidator. The creditors have the
option of replacing the liquidator appointed by the shareholders during the earlier phase. After this:

- Business activities must cease.

- The directors’ powers to control the company cease.

- Any transfer of shares or any alteration in the status of members or any attachment, sequestration, distress
or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of
creditors’ winding-up is void.

- No action or proceedings shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company after the
commencement of the creditors’ winding-up of the company except by leave of the court.

_Unsecured Creditor Rights, Remedies and Priorities_

The CA 2016 does not provide specific rights and remedies for unsecured creditors. However, unsecured creditors
who have the right to vote might be able to disrupt the restructuring process, as any proposal made for corporate
voluntary arrangement will only be binding on all creditors after obtaining a majority of 75% in value of the
creditors.

An unsecured creditor has to prove his or her debt. An unsecured creditor will only be paid after the secured
creditors and preferential creditors’ debts have been fully settled.

The time-limit to commence a legal action against a debtor in any matters relating to any forms of contract is
generally 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued, i.e., the date on which the money is due for
payment. When a judgment has been obtained, the judgment creditor has 12 years from the date that the judgment
became enforceable to enforce the judgment and no arrears of interests in respect of the judgement debt shall be
recovered after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the interests became due.

274


-----

_Scheme of Arrangement_

A scheme of arrangement is a court-approved compromise or arrangement that may be initiated by the company,
any creditor or member of the company, liquidator (if the company is being wound up) or the judicial manager (if
the company is under judicial management). The initiator will apply to the court for an order for meeting of the
creditors or members to be held. Only a proposed compromise or arrangement that has been agreed by 75% of the
total value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and voting either in person
or by proxy at the meeting and approved by the court will be binding on all the creditors, members of the company,
the company or the liquidator and contributories (if the company is being wound up).

When a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors or any class of
those creditors, the court may, on application by the company or any member or creditor of the company, pursuant
to Section 368(1) of the CA 2016, grant a restraining order. A restraining order may include, amongst others,
orders restraining: (i) resolutions for winding up of the company, (ii) execution, distress or other legal process
against any property of the company except with the leave of the court, (iii) proceedings commenced or continued
against the company except with the leave of the court, other than limited proceedings such as applications by any
creditor of the company while a restraining order is in force seeking orders restraining the disposal of property.
The restraining order granted under Section 368(1) of the CA 2016 may be extended for a period of not more than
9 months if the conditions in Section 368(2) of the CA 2016 are fulfilled.

Following an application made for a scheme of arrangement or any restraining order as aforementioned, the court
may, on application by the company, grant orders for securing debts of rescue financing in higher priority to that
of an existing security interest on the property of the company, if conditions under Section 368B of the CA 2016
are met. “Rescue financing” means any financing which is either necessary for the survival of the company or the
whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern, necessary for the court’s approval pursuant to a scheme
or arrangement or necessary to achieve a more advantageous realization of the assets of the company, than on a
winding up of the company.

In a scheme of arrangement, the directors and officers of the company will continue to manage the company.
However, any disposition or acquisition of property made after the grant of the restraining order of the court, other
than in the ordinary course of business of the company, without leave of the court, shall be void and the company
and every officer which does so shall be guilty of an offence. Whilst the directors are not prevented from
continuing the operation of business and creating further indebtedness in a scheme of arrangement, in the event
that the company goes into liquidation, the directors will be liable if they contracted to a debt without reasonable
expectation that the company will be able to pay the debt.

_Corporate Voluntary Arrangement_

A corporate voluntary arrangement (“CVA”) is a mechanism that involves minimal court intervention. Persons
who may propose a voluntary arrangement are the directors of a company, the judicial manager (if the company
is under a judicial management order (“JMO”)) or liquidator (if the company is being wound up). In a CVA, the
directors and officers of the company will continue to manage the company subject to the moratorium that
commences automatically upon filing the requisite documents. The moratorium shall remain in force for 28 days
but may be extended for up to 60 days. During this period, no petition may be presented for the winding-up of the
company, no application for JMO may be made against the company, no judicial manager of the company may
be appointed, no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process may be commenced or continued and
no distress may be levied, against the company or its property except with the approval of the court.

Similar to a scheme of arrangement, there are no provisions prohibiting the directors from continuing the operation
of business and create further indebtedness, however, in the event the company goes into liquidation the directors
will be liable if they contracted to a debt without reasonable expectation that the company will be able to pay the
debt.

_Judicial Management_

The judicial management is a new corporate rescue mechanism that only came into force on March 1, 2018. An
application for the appointment of a judicial manager may be made jointly or separately by (i) a company under
a resolution of its members or the board of directors; or (ii) a creditor, including any contingent or prospective

275


-----

creditor. An applicant must nominate an insolvency practitioner, who is not the auditor of the company, to act as
the judicial manager.

The court will only make a JMO in relation to a company that has not gone into liquidation and if the court is
satisfied that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts and the JMO will be likely to achieve one or more
of the purposes as listed in Section 405(1)(b) of the CA 2016, namely: (i) the survival of the company, or the
whole or part of its undertaking as a going concern; (ii) the approval of a compromise or arrangement under
Section 366 of the CA 2016 between the company and any such persons mentioned in the section; or (iii) a more
advantageous realization of the company assets than would be effected by a winding-up.

Upon the appointment of a judicial manager pursuant to a JMO, any receiver or receiver and manager shall vacate
the office and any winding-up application shall be dismissed. The powers conferred and duties imposed on the
directors shall be exercised by the judicial manager upon his or her appointment.

A JMO shall remain in force for 6 months but may be extended for another 6-month period. During such period,
no resolution shall be passed or order made for the winding up of the company, no receiver or receiver and
manager shall be appointed, no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process shall be commenced or
continued and no distress may be levied against the company or its property except with the consent of the judicial
manager or with the leave of the Court. In addition, no steps shall be taken to transfer any share of the company
or to alter the status of any member of the company except with the consent of the judicial manager or with the
leave of the Court. Similar provisions on priority of security interest for rescue financing as described in the “—
_Scheme of Arrangement” section above are applicable for a JMO, on application by the judicial manager instead._

In addition, any transfer, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against the
company from the company’s own money in favor of any creditor or any person in trust of any creditor with the
intention to give such creditor a preference over other creditors shall be void in the event of the company being
placed under judicial management on an application for a JMO presented within 6 months from the date of making,
taking, paying or suffering the transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution and every such act.
However, this does not affect the rights of any person making title in good faith and for valuable consideration
through or under a creditor of the company placed under the judicial management.

**_Limitations on Granting of Guarantees_**

The fundamental principle underlying the issue of corporate benefit is that directors must exercise their powers in
the best interest of the company. The duties and liabilities of officers of a company are now codified in Section
213 of the CA 2016. When acting in the interest of the company, a director must exercise his powers for a proper
purpose and in good faith (Section 213(1) of the CA 2016). Therefore, if a director acts in good faith in the best
interest of the company but for a collateral purpose, he would be in contravention of Section 213(1) of the CA
2016 and shall on conviction be liable to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding five years or subject to a fine not
exceeding MYR3 million or to both.

Ultimately, it is a question of fact as to whether a transaction has commercial benefit for a company. In practice,
resolutions of the directors should set out in detail the commercial benefit that the company will derive from
entering into a particular transaction.

In addition, no Malaysian company shall provide any financial assistance, whether directly or indirectly and
whether by means of a loan, guarantee or the provision of security or otherwise, for the purpose of or in connection
with a purchase or a subscription made or to be made of or for any shares in the Malaysian company or in the case
where the Malaysian company is a subsidiary, any shares in its holding company or in any way purchase, deal in
or lend money on its own shares. A Malaysian company is also not allowed to give guarantee in connection with
a loan made to any persons connected with its director or a director of its holding company (including issuance of
bonds by such persons), unless, inter alia, the relationship between the guarantor and the borrower or issuer is that
of holding company and subsidiary or subsidiary of a holding company.

**_Undue Preference_**

Under Section 528 of the CA 2016, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other acts
relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as the debts become

276


-----

due, from its own money in favor of any creditor or person in trust for any creditor, will be deemed fraudulent
and void, if the company is presented with a winding up petition within 6 months from the date of such transfer,
delivery, payment or act, unless the transfer, delivery, payment or act is in favor of any person dealing with the
company for valuable consideration and without any actual notice of the company’s inability to pay its debts or
any winding-up proceedings against the company.

**_Foreign Exchange Policy Considerations_**

The Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) (“BNM”) imposes certain exchange control restrictions
on the granting of guarantees. These restrictions are provided for in Foreign Exchange Policy Notices issued by
BNM on June 1, 2022 (“FEP Notices”), which includes a restriction on giving of guarantee by a non-bank resident
of Malaysia to secure a borrowing (a) obtained by a non-resident of Malaysia which is a special purpose vehicle
or if the underlying borrowing is being utilized by the resident guarantor, or (b) where the resident guarantor has
entered into a formal or informal arrangement to make repayment of the borrowing in foreign currency other than
under a call-upon by the lender in the event of default. As the Issuer is not a special purpose vehicle under the
provisions of the FEP Notices, nor will the proceeds of the Notes be utilized by the Malaysian Guarantor, the
aforementioned paragraph (a) would not be applicable. However, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
Malaysian Guarantor may be required to make repayment of the Notes and other similar obligations in relation
thereto, other than under a call-upon by the Trustee in the event of default affecting the Notes. Notwithstanding,
the aforementioned restriction would only be triggered such that approval from BNM would be required if the
amounts guaranteed by the Malaysian Guarantor exceed MYR50 million equivalent in a calendar year.

As such, the Guarantee and any other guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability granted or undertaken by the
Malaysian Guarantor, or over any of the shares or quotas of, or any credit rights over, the Malaysian Guarantor,
shall be limited to a global maximum amount (that will not be higher, but may be lower, than €10 million (which
is, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately MYR50 million)), and, as a result, the Malaysian
Guarantor will not have an obligation to repay any amounts to the holders of the Notes under such Guarantee and
any other guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability once the relevant maximum amount has been reached, as
applicable. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Malaysian Guarantor has not yet obtained approval
from BNM to provide its Guarantee. In the absence of BNM’s written approval, and to the extent that amounts
guaranteed by the Malaysian Guarantor exceed MYR50 million equivalent in a calendar year, such Guarantee
may only be enforced upon a declaration of an event of default under the Notes.

Upon receipt of BNM’s written approval for the Malaysian Guarantor to provide its Guarantee under the Notes,
if requested and obtained, no further approval will be required from BNM or any other Malaysian regulator for
the repatriation of the enforcement proceeds in foreign currency out of Malaysia. However, the guarantor may
need to notify BNM in the event the guarantee is called upon within a specified period. There is no limit on the
amount of proceeds that may be repatriated at any time under such circumstances, but the proceeds must be
converted to foreign currency before the repatriation is made.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Banco Santander, S.A., Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs
Bank Europe SE, HSBC Bank plc and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), to be entered into in connection
with the issuance of Notes, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and each of the Initial Purchasers
has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from the Issuer the principal amount of Notes set forth
in the Purchase Agreement.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are
purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of
the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them,
subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes, and other conditions
contained in the Purchase Agreement, such as the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of officer’s certificates and
legal opinions. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the
Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may
not be offered or sold within the US except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the US to Non-US
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the US in reliance on
Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. To the extent any
Initial Purchaser that is not a US registered broker-dealer intends to effect any offers or sales of any Notes in the
US, it will do so through one or more US registered broker-dealers in accordance with the applicable US securities
laws and regulations. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, an offer or
sale of Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes
are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market—Solely for the**
purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers (if any), the target market assessment in respect of
the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined
in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
**Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the**
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors—The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of

278


-----

Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

**MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market—Solely for the purposes**
of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each
as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt
securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors—The Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to and should not**
be offered or sold to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA**
has been prepared And therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIPs Regulation.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed, that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be

communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything

done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the US and the UK, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this
Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to
sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The offering of any Notes which are the subject of the Offering is not being made and will not be made to the
public in any member state of the European Economic Area other than in circumstances falling within or as
permitted under the Prospectus Regulation.

279


-----

The offering of any Notes which are the subject of the Offering is not being made and will not be made to the
public in the United Kingdom other than in circumstances falling within or as permitted under Regulation
2017/1129 as it forms part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of EUWA.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer does not intend to apply
for listing of the Notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer
quotation system.

Application has been made to list the Notes on the London Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on the London
Stock Exchange’s ISM. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that
such listing will be maintained. The Issuer cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the
market after this Offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the
Notes will continue after this Offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make
a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making
activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject
to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act and may be limited. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that
you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be
favorable.

**Settlement Cycle**

We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the       business day following the date of pricing
of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+      ”) Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this
Offering Memorandum or the next       business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will
settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not during the period from the date of this Offering
Memorandum and including the date that is 30 days after such date, without first obtaining the prior written
consent of the Initial Purchasers, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities issued or
guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having a tenor more than one year.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager or one or more of its affiliates (or persons acting on their
behalf) may over-allot the Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes
during the stabilization period at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilization
may not necessarily occur. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public
disclosure of the final terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may cease at any time, but must end
no later than 30 days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the issue, or no later than and 60
days after the date of allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over allotment must be conducted by the
Stabilizing Manager (or person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) in accordance with all applicable
laws and regulations and will be undertaken at the offices of the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on their
behalf) and on the ISM of the London Stock Exchange.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required
to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the Notes in
the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there

280


-----

may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may
have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the
representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and/or may in the future engage
in, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, treasury management, cash pooling and other
payment related business, overdraft facilities, guarantee/letter of credit facilities, trade finance, hedging business,
receivable financing/factoring facilities, transaction and clearing services, fleet leasing facilities, corporate
pension management, broking, consulting and financial advisory services and/or other commercial dealings in the
ordinary course of business with the Issuer and/or its affiliates for which they may receive customary advisory
and transaction fees and expense reimbursement. CommerzFactoring GmbH, an affiliate of Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, is acting as purchaser under the Factoring Facilities. In addition, Citibank, N.A., an affiliate
of Citigroup, HSBC Bank plc, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and Banco Santander, S.A. are, _inter alia,_
mandated lead arrangers, bookrunners and/or original lenders under the UKEF Facilities. Furthermore, Citibank,
N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, HSBC Bank plc, Goldman Sachs International, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs,
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Banco Santander, S.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., an affiliate of J.P.
Morgan Securities plc, are, inter alia, mandated lead arrangers, bookrunners and/or original lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain drawings under which will be repaid from the proceeds of the
Offering. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or
the Issuer’s affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending
relationship with the Issuer or its subsidiaries may routinely hedge their credit exposure to these entities consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in securities (including potentially, the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities
and instruments. In addition, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and HSBC
Bank plc have been engaged to act as dealer managers in connection with the Tender Offer (the “Dealer
**Managers” and each a “Dealer Manager”). In such capacity, the Dealer Managers will contact holders of the**
Existing Notes regarding the Tender Offer and will request brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies
and other nominees to forward the Offer to Purchase and related materials to beneficial owners of the Existing
Notes. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Dealer Managers a fee for their services as Dealer Managers in connection
with the Tender Offer. In addition, the Issuer has agreed that it will reimburse the Dealer Managers for certain of
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Dealer Managers against certain
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_The following restrictions will apply to the Notes. You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any_
_offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the Notes and/or the Guarantees offered hereby._

Neither the Notes nor the Guarantee have been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the “Securities Act”), any state securities laws or any other securities laws of any other jurisdictions
and, unless so registered, and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, applicable state
securities laws and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we are offering and selling
the Notes only:

  - to persons that we reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as
“QIBs,” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) in compliance with
Rule 144A; and

  - to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under

in Regulation S.

If you purchase Notes in this Offering, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used
in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) You understand that the Notes and the Guarantee are being offered for sale in a transaction not involving
any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law, that neither the Notes nor the Guarantee have been or will be registered under the
Securities Act and that (A) if in the future you decide to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of
the Notes, Notes purchased pursuant to Rule 144A may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise
transferred only (i) in the United States to a person whom you reasonably believe is a QIB in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in a transaction
complying with Regulation S and (iii) in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not
subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs 4
and 5 in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States,
and that (B) you will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the
Notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to in the legend below.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) or acting on our behalf and you are either:

(a) QIB and are aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A
and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another party that is a
QIB; or

Regulation S and are not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person.

(3) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Company, the Initial Purchasers or any person representing
the Issuer, the Company or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with respect to the
Issuer or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than by the Issuer and the Company with respect to
the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the
Notes. You acknowledge that the Initial Purchasers make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy
or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other
information concerning the Issuer, the Company, the Indentures, the Notes, and the Guarantee as you
have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase Notes, including an opportunity to
ask questions of and request information from the Issuer, the Company and the Initial Purchasers.

282


-----

(4) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the Securities Act or any state
securities law, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of
that investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their
ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other available exemption from
registration under the Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the
Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to
offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes only (i) to the Issuer, the Company or any subsidiary thereof;
(ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act, an
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in any transaction not subject
thereto, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes
is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the
United States in compliance with Regulation S or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement
of law that the disposal of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable
local laws and regulations, provided that, as to the Regulation S Notes only, the restriction set forth above
applies only until the date that is 40 days after the later of the date of issuance of the Notes and the last
date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto).
Resales pursuant to the above restriction are further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior
to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (iv) and (v) to require the delivery of an opinion
of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the
foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security
is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially in the following form:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR OTHER

LEGEND. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS “U.S. PERSON,” “OFFSHORE
**TRANSACTION” AND “UNITED STATES” HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM**
BY REGULATION S.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(6) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of the

(7) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any Notes
acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that the
restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(8) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Company, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy
of your acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and you
agree that, if any of your acknowledgements, representations, warranties or agreements herein
cease to be accurate and complete, you will notify us and the Initial Purchasers promptly in
writing; and

(b) if you are acquiring any Notes as fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you
represent with respect to each such account that:

(i) you have sole investment discretion; and

(ii) you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and

possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the

Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Consequently, any
transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

(11) You represent that you are not a “retail investor” in the U.K. For purposes of this paragraph, the
expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:

(a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms
part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(b) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(c) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

(12) You understand and acknowledge that no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs
Regulation or the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation in the U.K. or for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the U.K. has been prepared and, therefore,
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the
U.K. may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation or the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

(13) You represent that you are a “relevant person,” where “relevant persons” are persons who are: (i) persons
who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the
Financial Promotion Order (the “Order”); (ii) persons falling within Article 49 (“high net worth
companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Order; (iii) persons outside the United Kingdom;
or (iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning
of Section 21 of the FSMA in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully
be communicated or caused to be communicated.

(14) You represent that you are not a “retail investor” in the EEA. For purposes of this paragraph, the
expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:

(a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(b) a customer within the meaning of Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

_The following is a summary of service of process and enforcement of judgments in some of the jurisdictions in_
_which the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized. The description is only a summary and does_
_not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the ability to serve_
_process and enforce judgments with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees. Prospective investors in the Notes_
_should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

The Issuer is a public company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Guarantors are privately
held companies, certain of which are organized outside of the United States. Future guarantors may be organized
under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions.

All of the Issuer’s directors and executive officers and certain of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or their respective directors, officers and other
executives or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer has
appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York.

In addition, as many of the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s assets and the assets of their respective directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or U.S.
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or the Guarantors, investors will need to
enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and
Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In
such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such
a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English
court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following:

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the
U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to
the rules of English private international law);

  - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

  - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

  - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or statute in England and Wales;

  - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue
law;

  - the recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment not being restricted by the provisions of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

288


-----

  - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or
substantial justice;

  - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of the courts of England
and Wales or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales;

  - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.;

  - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and

  - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether
an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England
and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the
judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment
debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in
England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**Germany**

One of the Guarantors (Synthomer Deutschland GmbH) is organized under the laws of Germany (the “German
**Guarantor”). None of the directors, officers or other executives of the German Guarantor are residents or citizens**
of the United States. Therefore, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the
directors, officers or executives. Furthermore, since the assets of the German Guarantor, and its respective
directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against
the German Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under
U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a
judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Germany.

As a general rule, a final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, for the payment of a specific sum of money
based on civil matters, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. court, unless

- the courts of the jurisdiction where the relevant court is located did not have jurisdiction according to the
principles on jurisdictional competence under German law;

- the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or the defendant
was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or within sufficient time
and in such a way to enable him to arrange for his defense, unless the defendant failed to commence
proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for the defendant; a method of service of
process agreed upon may not be regarded as due service if such method is contrary to the applicable law
(including any international treaty) on service for the proceedings;

289


-----

- the judgment is irreconcilable with (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a
German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is
to be recognized in Germany or (iii) the procedure leading to the respective judgment being irreconcilable
with a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

- such recognition entails results which are obviously irreconcilable with fundamental principles of
German law (ordre public), including without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of
Germany (Grundrechte), in particular with regard to procedural law, especially violations of the right to
a fair hearing may be considered violations of an essential principle of German law; or

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on final U.S. judgments (res judicata) may be sought against German
defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the
above principles. Even if a U.S. judgment is recognized in Germany, it does not necessarily mean that it will be
enforced under all circumstances. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an
enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such
foreign judgment became res judicata, a defense against enforcement may arise. Enforcement and foreclosure
based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision
from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may
be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state
courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, judicial liquidation, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium
as well as other similar laws, provisions or circumstances affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is
doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German
court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil
procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded to as mandatory
and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant
application violates German public policy.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany,
such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the relevant Guarantor or such
persons will be, basically, regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which
such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re- hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line
with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. If however a judgment must be
recognized under the German Code of Civil Procedure (see above), a German court has to deliver its judgment in
accordance with the findings of the final judgment by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts
as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to
compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to
the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process
exists under German law.

**Malaysia**

Substantially all of the assets of the Malaysian Guarantor are located outside the United States. In addition, all of
the directors and executive officers of the Malaysian Guarantor are not residents or citizens in the United States
and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are not located in the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within United States upon such persons or to enforce

290


-----

judgments obtained in courts within United States, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, against such persons or the Malaysian Guarantor.
We have been advised by our Malaysian counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Malaysian courts,
in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities
predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States.

Under current Malaysian law, any judgment obtained for a fixed sum against the Malaysian Guarantor in a court
of a foreign jurisdiction with which Malaysia has no arrangement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments, after
due service of process, may, at the discretion of the courts of Malaysia be actionable in the courts of Malaysia by
way of a suit on a debt if such judgement is final and conclusive and so long as the judgement:

(a) is not inconsistent with public policy in Malaysia;

(b) was not given or obtained by fraud or duress or in a manner contrary to natural justice;

(c) is not directly or indirectly for the payment of taxes or other charges of a like nature or of a fine or other
penalty;

(d) was of a court of competent jurisdiction of such jurisdiction and the judgment debtor being the defendant
in the original court received notice of those proceedings in sufficient time to enable it to defend the
proceedings;

(e) has not been wholly satisfied;

(f) could be enforced by execution in the country of that original court;

(g) is final and conclusive between the parties;

(h) is for a fixed sum;

(i) is not directly or indirectly intended to enforce the penal laws or sanctions imposed by the authorities of
such jurisdiction;

(j) is not preceded by a final and conclusive judgment by a court having jurisdiction in that matter; and

(k) is a judgement where the rights thereunder are vested in the person by whom the suit in the Malaysian
courts based on the foreign judgment was filed.

There is currently no agreement for reciprocal enforcement of judgments between Malaysia and New York, and
as such, if a New York court were to rule in an investor’s favor, it may be difficult to enforce such judgments in
Malaysia. Due to the absence of reciprocal arrangements, judgments obtained in a New York court will only be
enforced in Malaysia in accordance with the common law principles and fresh proceedings must be instituted in
Malaysia by the judgment creditor and upon re-litigation and re-examination of the issues.

**Italy**

Certain Guarantors are organized or incorporated (as applicable) under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the
“Italian Guarantors”). Substantially all of our directors and executive officers and of each of the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Substantially all of our assets and each of the Guarantors, and our and their
directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the
United States against us or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment
of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil
liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore,
although we and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will
submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service
of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including
actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors
to effect service of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons mentioned above

291


-----

provided that, for example, the requirements of The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 are complied with. If a judgment
is obtained in a U.S. court against us, any Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets.
Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for Italy, you
should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those
countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The United States and Italy do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Since two Guarantors are domiciled in Italy in case a judgement is
obtained in a U.S. court against such Italian Guarantors, investors will need to enforce such judgment in
jurisdictions where the relevant companies have their assets (i.e. in the case of the Italian Guarantors, most likely,
in Italy).

We have been advised by counsel in Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered by a U.S.
federal or New York state court, even if obtained by default, in Italy is governed by Article 64 of the Private
International Law Act (i.e. Law 218 of May 31, 1995, _Riforma del Sistema Italiano di diritto internazionale_
_privato) (the “PIL Act”) (and certain other provisions of the PIL Act)._

Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court, even if obtained by
default, can be recognized in Italy without re-examination of the merits of the case provided that the following
requirements are met:

- the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court had appropriate jurisdiction to pass judgment upon the
matter (in accordance with the Italian rules on jurisdiction);

- the defendant had appropriately been served the relevant summons and complaints in accordance with
the laws of the state in which the proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived
of his/her essential rights;

- the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the
proceedings were conducted in absentia (in contumacia) in accordance with such local procedural law;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is final, not subject to any further
appeal in accordance with U.S. law and binding (passato in giudicato) according to the law of the state
in which it was issued;

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any final and
binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

- there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and between
the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the relevant U.S.
federal or New York state court; and

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public policy
(ordine pubblico).

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding
must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to this end. The competent Court of Appeal does not
consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above
(including that requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary
to public policy in Italy).

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the
U.S. federal securities law is debatable. If an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court
may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought

292

(e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of
Italian law.

#### Independent auditors’ report

to the members of Synthomer plc

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**
**Opinion**
In our opinion:

- Synthomer Plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial
statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view
of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at
31 December 2021 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for
the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the
Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated balance sheet
and Company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021;
the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the
Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity, and
Reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to movement
in net debt for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial
statements, which include a description of the significant
accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements
in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.
In August 2021, we applied to the FRC for a one-year waiver in respect
of the UK non-audit services fee cap for our audit of Synthomer Plc’s
financial period ending 31 December 2021. The waiver was in respect
of fees relating to private reporting in relation to the Eastman’s
Adhesive Resins business acquisition and followed a similar waiver
request in 2020. The application was approved as the exceptional
circumstances test was met, with mitigations put in place by us and
the Company to manage the risks to auditor independence.

Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Company
in the period under audit.


**Our audit approach**
**Context**
In planning and executing our audit we have considered the Group’s
climate risk assessment process (as described in the Sustainability
report and TCFD report). This, together with discussions with our own
climate change specialists, provided us with a good understanding
of the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements.
Management consider that the impact of climate change does not give
rise to a material financial statement impact. We used our knowledge
of the Group to evaluate management’s assessment. The Group is
targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and with Vision 2030
they are working on their pathway towards this. The Group has started
to quantify some of the impacts that may arise on this pathway and
we have discussed with management and the Audit Committee that
the estimated financial impacts of climate change will need to be
frequently reassessed and our expectation that climate change
disclosures will continue to evolve as greater understanding of the
actual and potential impacts on the Group’s future operations are
obtained. We considered how climate change risks would impact the
assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by management used in
their impairment analyses and going concern. We also considered the
consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change made in
the other information within the Annual Report with the financial
statements and our knowledge from our audit.

#### Independent auditors report continued

to the members of Synthomer plc

**Key audit matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional
judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements of the current period and include the most significant
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit;
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and
any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon,
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide
a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.


Presentation of special items is a new key audit matter this year.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and OMNOVA acquisition
accounting, which were key audit matters last year, are no longer
included because of the ability of the Group to continue to generate
profits and operate despite disruption related to the COVID-19
pandemic, and the accounting related to the OMNOVA acquisition
being finalised in the prior year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below
are consistent with last year.


**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


_Uncertain Tax Provisions (Group)_
The Group has a wide geographical footprint
and is subject to a range of tax laws in a
number of different tax jurisdictions. As set
out in Note 10, the Group has a number
of uncertain tax provisions totalling £23.7m
(2020: £45.9m) as at 31 December 2021.
By nature, uncertain tax positions require a
significant element of judgement to determine
an appropriate provision. As such, we have
assessed that a significant risk exists in relation
to valuation and presentation and disclosure
assertions to ensure that provisions made
are appropriate.

_Valuation of defined benefit pension liabilities_
_and level 3 assets (Group)_
As set out in note 26, the Group had £122.4m
(2020: £221.4m) net liabilities as at
31 December 2021 in relation to defined
benefit pension schemes. These primarily
represent the Yule Catto Group retirement
benefits scheme in the UK, the OMNOVA
Solutions Consolidated Pension Plan in the US
and an unfunded scheme in Germany, which
account for £4.6m, £27.7m, and £74.7m
respectively of the net pension deficit.
The Group uses third party actuaries to
calculate the pension liabilities. The valuation of
these liabilities is based on a number of
assumptions and the calculation is highly
sensitive to small changes in the assumptions.
For instance, changes in inflation, mortality
tables and discount rate can have a significant
impact on the valuation of the liability recorded.

The pension asset also contains level 3 and
other complex assets (complex PIVs where
assets are not traded on Recognised
Investment Exchanges (RIE)) totalling £266m
as at 31 December 2021 (31 December
2020: £320m), which are complex in nature to
value and therefore we deem there to be a risk
with respect to the valuation of these assets.


In order to assess the valuation and appropriateness of presentation and disclosure we:

- Engaged our tax specialists (including transfer pricing specialists) to assess the level
of provision held against various tax exposures was materially appropriate. In our
assessment we had regard to the nature of individual exposures, including their origin,
and any developments in the year to assess the rationale for their continued validity
at the current year end.

- Inspected correspondence with tax authorities and the Group’s tax advisors to evaluate
valuation and completeness of provisions.

- Challenged judgements made by management by assessing individual provisions against
our expectations of potential exposures, having regard to the facts of each case.

- Considered the adequacy of disclosure in the annual report.

No significant issues arose from this work to suggest that the judgements made, amounts
provided or disclosures were inappropriate.

In order to assess the identified risks we:

- We reviewed external actuarial reports of the UK and German schemes which set out
the calculations and assumptions underpinning the year end pension scheme liabilities
valuation and our US component team reviewed an external actuarial report for the
US scheme .

- We (and PwC US) held discussions with the external actuaries and were satisfied that the
scope of their work was such that we could use this work to provide evidence for the
purpose of our audit.

- We assessed the competency and objectivity of the external actuaries commissioned by
the Group to perform the year end calculations by considering their technical expertise
and independence from the Group.

- We used our own specialist actuarial team to evaluate the key assumptions used in each
of the three schemes by comparing these assumptions to our expectations for similar
schemes as at the year end.

- With respect to the level 3 and other more complex assets, we tested values through a
combination of the following procedures: reviewed audited accounts of pooled investment
vehicles; reviewed internal controls reports of the service provider responsible for the
valuation of the fund, including obtaining bridging letters where the control report does
not cover the current financial period of Synthomer plc; obtained fund transactions close
to the year end (where available), and obtained third party confirmation from the
investment managers.

- We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures within the financial statements

We found management’s assumptions to be within an acceptable range. We identified no
concerns over their competency or objectivity.

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


_Presentation and quantum of Special Items_
_(Group)_
The Group presents two measures of
performance in the income statement;
statutory and underlying, the latter after
adjusting for certain items of income or
expenses as management believes these
measures provide additional useful information
on the underlying trends, performance and
position of the Group.

The determination of which items of income
or expense are classified as Special items
is subject to judgement and therefore
users of the financial statements could be
misled if amounts are not classified or
calculated appropriately.

Description of the amounts presented as
Special items are included in note 4 to the
financial statements.

_Recoverability of investment in, and amounts_
_owed by, Group undertakings (Company)_
As disclosed in Note 3 of the Parent Company
financial statements, the Company held an
investment in subsidiaries of £536.7m
(2020: £370.5) and amounts owed by Group
undertakings of £1,275m (2020: £1443.4m)
at 31 December 2021.

The assessment of the recoverability of these
assets required the application of management
judgement, particularly in determining whether
any impairment indicators have arisen that
trigger the need for a formal impairment
assessment and in assessing whether the
carrying value of each investment and amounts
owed by Group undertakings are recoverable.

As changes to these judgements and estimates
could have a material impact on the Company
financial statements, we consider this to be
a key audit matter.


We considered the appropriateness of amounts classified as Special items. To do this
we considered:

- The Group’s accounting policy on special items; and Pronouncements by the Financial
Reporting Council on this matter.

- We challenged management on the appropriateness of the classification of such Special
items, being mindful that classification should be even-handed between gains and losses,
the basis the classification should be clearly disclosed and a clear reconciliation to
statutory measures provided and applied consistently one year to the next.

- We challenged management on the quantum of the elements of the Special items, and
the estimates underpinning some of them, including discussions with the Group’s legal
advisors where appropriate.

Our work highlighted certain items that management had classified as special items which
were judgemental. Having considered the nature and quantum of these items, overall we are
satisfied that the presentation of special items in the financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2021 is appropriate.

Our procedures included the following:

- Evaluating management’s assessment of whether any indicators of impairment existed.

- Assessing the recoverable value by reference to the net assets of the underlying
subsidiaries and amounts owed by Group undertakings with reference to the Director’s
intentions for the settlement of Group-wide intercompany balances.

- Verifying that the recoverable values of the investment was consistent with the recoverable
value of the CGU tested for goodwill impairment purposes, leveraging the audit work
undertaken as part of the Group audit.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues from our work.


**How we tailored the audit scope**
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the
Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry
in which they operate.

As set out in note 5 ‘Segmental analysis’, the Group reports its results
as four segments: ‘Performance Elastomers’, ‘Functional Solutions’,
‘Industrial Specialities’ and ‘Acrylate Monomers’. The Group financial
statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding
companies, intermediate holding companies and operating
companies, across 24 countries. Three countries, being the USA,
Germany and Malaysia, account for the majority of the Group’s results.
We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in
these countries, which were subject to audits of their complete
financial information. In addition, to increase our coverage of the
Group’s revenue and underlying profit before tax we performed full
scope audit procedures at an additional eleven reporting units located
in the UK, Italy, Germany, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Austria and
France. These components accounted for 84% of the Group’s
revenue, 93% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.


Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined
the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those
reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the
Group financial statements as a whole. During the audit, senior
members of the Group team held a number of meetings with the audit
teams from key reporting units in the UK, Germany, Malaysia and the
USA, and reviewed the work performed by these teams over those
areas of higher audit risk.

**Materiality**
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together
with qualitative considerations, helped us determine the scope of our
audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.


-----

#### Independent auditors report continued

to the members of Synthomer plc

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**Financial statements – Group** **Financial statements – Company**
_Overall materiality_ £11,605,000 (2020: £7,900,000). £10,444,500 (2020: £18,660,000).

approximately 5% of three-year average of underlying profit Based on 1% of total assets capped at 90% of Group
_How we determined it_ before taxation (2020: underlying profit before taxation). materiality.
_Rationale for_ Underlying profit before taxation, being profit before tax Total assets is the primary measure used by the
_benchmark applied_ adjusted for special items, is a key metric for investors and shareholders in assessing the performance of the Company,
is used by the Board in measuring the Group’s financial and is a generally accepted benchmark. The value is
performance. capped at 90% of the Group overall materiality.


For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated
a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range
of materiality allocated across components was between £1,300,000
to £10,706,500. Certain components were audited to a local statutory
audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected
misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use
performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and
the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes
of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample
sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2020: 75%) of overall
materiality, amounting to £8,703,000 (2020: £5,925,000) for the
Group financial statements and £7,830,000 (2020: £2,250,000) for
the Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of
factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation
risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount
at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to
them misstatements identified during our audit above £580,000
(Group audit) (2020: £395,000) and £522,000 (Company audit)
(2020: £395,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
Our evaluation of the members’ assessment of the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting included:

- We reviewed the Directors’ model supporting their going concern
assumption. We discussed with management the assumptions
applied in the going concern review so we could understand and
challenge the rationale for those assumptions, using our knowledge
of the business. We tested the model’s mathematical accuracy
and considered the reasonableness of the revenue and cost
assumptions made and the available headroom throughout
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval
of the financial statements.

- We reviewed management’s sensitivity scenarios including their
severe but plausible downside. We considered potential mitigating
actions available to the Group that are achievable and within
management’s control. We then assessed the availability of
liquid resources under the different scenarios and the associated
covenant tests applicable; and

- We also assessed additional downside sensitivities and considered

the impact on covenants and liquidity headroom.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.


In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the
members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,
this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the members’ reporting on how they have applied the
UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or
draw attention to in relation to the members’ statement in the financial
statements about whether the members considered it appropriate to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the members with
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections
of this report.

**Reporting on other information**
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual
Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report
thereon. The members are responsible for the other information,
which includes reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Our opinion on
the financial statements does not cover the other information and,
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit,
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an
apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a
material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing
to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ Report, we also
considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies
Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and
matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors’ Report**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the
audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’
Report for the year ended 31 December 2021 is consistent with
the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance
with applicable legal requirements.


-----

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report
and Directors’ Report.

**Directors’ Remuneration**
In our opinion, the part of the Annual Report on Remuneration to
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.

**Corporate governance statement**
The Listing Rules require us to review the members’ statements in
relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the
corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for
our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate
governance statement as other information are described in the
Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have
concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- The members’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal
risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;

- The members’ statement in the financial statements about whether
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material
uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do
so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval
of the financial statements;

- The members’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s
and Company’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and
why the period is appropriate; and

- The members’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable
expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors’ statement regarding the longer-term
viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit
and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’
process supporting their statement; checking that the statement
is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is
consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and
understanding of the Group and Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we
have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate
governance statement is materially consistent with the financial
statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- The members’ statement that they consider the Annual Report,
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and
provides the information necessary for the members to assess the
Group’s and Company’s position, performance, business model
and strategy;

- The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and

- The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the
Audit Committee.


We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report
when the members’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance
with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant
provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by
the auditors.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**
**Responsibilities of the members for the financial statements**
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities,
the members are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The members
are also responsible for such internal control as they determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the members are responsible
for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
members either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the**
**financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements
in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud,
is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that
the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related
to breaches of environmental, health and safety and competition
regulations, tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations
applicable to significant component teams, and we considered the extent
to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial
statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have
a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act
2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for
fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk
of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were
related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue and
management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement team
shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they
could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks
in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement
team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management and internal audit, including
consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations and fraud;

- Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and
detect irregularities;


-----

#### Independent auditors report continued

to the members of Synthomer plc

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management
in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to
provisions for uncertain tax positions, the European Commission
provision and the valuation of defined benefit scheme liabilities.
Where we considered appropriate, we held discussions with the
Group’s legal advisors.

- Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal
entries posted with unusual account combinations (for example
credit to revenue with a debit entry to an unexpected account) or
journals posted by senior management.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above.
We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and
transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk
of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain
transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques.
However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items
for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often
seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk
characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable
us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample
is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

**Use of this report**
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**
**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in
our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company,
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of members’ remuneration specified by law are
not made; or

- the Company financial statements and the part of the Annual Report
on Remuneration to be audited are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were
appointed by the members on 12 July 2012 to audit the financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 and subsequent
financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement
is 10 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2012 to
31 December 2021.


**Other matter**
As required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and
Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the
ESEF-prepared annual financial report filed on the National Storage
Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance with
the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’
report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report
has been prepared using the single electronic format specified in the
ESEF RTS.

#### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

31 December 2021


**1 General information**
Synthomer plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the
Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on
page 188. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) and the nature of the Group’s operations are set out
in the Strategic Report.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling,
the functional currency of the Company. Foreign operations are
included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.

**New and amended standards adopted by the Group**
There are no standards or interpretations that are not yet effective
and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity
in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable
future transactions.

**2 Significant accounting policies**
**Basis of preparation**
On 31 December 2020, IFRS as adopted by the European Union
at that date was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted
International Accounting Standards, with future changes being
subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Company
transitioned to UK-adopted International Accounting Standards in its
consolidated financial statements on 1 January 2021. This change
constitutes a change in accounting framework. However, there is
no impact on recognition, measurement or disclosure in the period
reported as a result of the change in framework.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards
and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable
to companies reporting under those standards.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments that are
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as
explained in the accounting policies below.

The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

**Going concern**
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through
its bank facilities. The current economic conditions continue to create
uncertainty, particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s
products. The Group’s forecasts and projections take account of
reasonably possible changes in trading performance and a severe but
plausible downside scenario has been prepared, linked to our principal
risks. This scenario does not threaten the Group’s ability to operate
within the level of its current facilities. No mitigating actions have been
included for any of the scenarios and, should it need to, the Group
could take action quickly to significantly reduce costs and cash
outflows as demonstrated during the course of the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020.

Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed
in connection with the viability statement (see page 81), the Directors
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in note 21.


**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is
achieved when the Company:

- has the power over the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement
with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins from the date the Company
obtains control and ceases from the date the Company loses control.
Where necessary on obtaining control, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies
into line with those used by the Group.

The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately
from the Group’s equity therein. Subsequent to the date on which
the Company obtains control, the carrying amount of non-controlling
interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus
the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and
cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group
are eliminated on consolidation.

**Business combinations**
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum
of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group,
liabilities incurred by the Group to former owners of the acquiree and
the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or
loss as incurred.

At acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes;

- liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are
recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee
Benefits; and

- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with
that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs,
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted
during a measurement period (see below), or additional assets or
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that,
if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

A measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition
to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject
to a maximum of one year.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously
held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date
fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit
or loss.

#### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2021


**2 Significant accounting policies continued**
**Goodwill**
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred
over the Group’s interest in acquisition-date identifiable assets
acquired less liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated
to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units are defined as
our reportable segments: Performance Elastomers, Functional
Solutions, Industrial Specialities and Acrylate Monomers.

Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss
on disposal.

Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

**Joint ventures**
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method, interests in joint ventures are
initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements
in other comprehensive income.

**Revenue**
**General**

Synthomer manufactures and sells mainly water-based polymers
across a diverse range of end use applications. Our products are
predominantly sold in liquid form, in bulk containers.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the
Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a customer when
performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue is recognised
at the point in time when control of the product is transferred
from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant asset in line
with the Incoterms under which it is sold. The significant majority of
Synthomer’s products are sold under Carriage Paid To (CPT) and
Carriage and Insurance Paid (CIP) International Commercial Terms.
Under these terms, control of the product is transferred when the goods
reach their destination. At this point the risks of obsolescence and loss
have been transferred and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could
affect the customer’s acceptance of the product. A receivable is
recognised at this point in time as consideration is unconditional and
only the passage of time is required before payment is due.

**Rebates**
Synthomer may grant customers rebates if the goods purchased by
the customer exceed a contractually defined threshold within the
specified period. Rebates are usually deducted from the amounts
payable by the customer. Depending on the terms of the underlying
contract, Synthomer uses either the expected value or the most likely
amount to estimate the variable consideration for expected future
rebates. Historical, current and forecast information is considered
when calculating rebates.


The majority of rebate programmes are aligned with the Group’s
financial year end, providing certainty around how much should be
recognised in the financial statements.

**Other**
The Group does not have any contracts where the period between
the transfer of promised goods to the customer and payment by the
customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group applies
the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of the
transaction prices for the time value of money.

**Foreign currencies**
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies,
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency
are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of
the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which they arise except for:

- exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain
foreign currency risks (see below under ‘hedge accounting’); and

- exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to
a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely
to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net
investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in
other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit
or loss on disposal of the net investment.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-Sterling
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any,
are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
a separate component of equity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate. The Group elected to treat goodwill
and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.

**Operating profit**
Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before
financing costs and taxation.

**Taxation**
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax.

**Current tax**
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax
determination is uncertain but it is considered probable that there
will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The provisions are
measured at best estimate of the amount expected to become payable.
The assessment is based on the judgement of tax professionals within
the Company supported by previous experience in respect of such
activities and in certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice


-----

**Deferred tax**
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will
be available against which deductible temporary differences can
be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary
differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments
in foreign operations where the Group is able to control the reversal of
the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all
or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt
with in other comprehensive income.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax
consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease,
at inception of the contract. The lease term is determined from the
commencement date of the contract and covers the non-cancellable
term. If considered reasonably certain, extension or termination
options are included in the lease term.

At the commencement date, a lease liability is recognised, measured
at the present value of the future lease payments and discounted
using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease
liability is adjusted by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest
on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease
payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any
reassessment or lease modifications.

At the commencement date, a right of use asset is recognised,
measured at an amount equal to the lease liability plus any lease
payments made before the commencement date and any initial direct
costs, less any lease incentive payments. An estimate of costs to be
incurred in restoring an asset, in accordance with the terms of the
lease, is also included in the right of use asset at initial recognition.
Subsequently, right of use assets are measured in accordance with
the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and the useful life
of the underlying asset. Any adjustments to the corresponding lease
liability are reflected in the corresponding right of use asset.

Short-term leases and low value leases are not recognised as lease
liabilities and right of use assets, but are recognised as an expense
straight-line over the lease term.


**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Cost comprises
original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset
to its working condition for its intended use, including, where
appropriate, capitalised finance costs.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the cost of assets less
their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line
method, on the following bases:

Freehold buildings – 50 years

Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and the
period of the lease

Plant and equipment – between 3 and 15 years

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any
recognised impairment loss. Finance costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part
of the cost of those assets. Depreciation of these assets commences
when the assets are ready for their intended use.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method
are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any
changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

**Acquired intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, which is regarded
as their cost. Where necessary the fair value of assets at acquisition and
their estimated useful lives are based on independent valuation reports.

Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is
recognised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, on the
following bases:

Customer relationships – between 5 and 15 years

Other intangibles – up to 10 years

Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.

Acquired intangible assets are derecognised upon reaching the end of
their useful lives.

**Other intangible assets**
Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business
combination are initially measured at cost and amortised on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or
from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised only if
all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the asset;

- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

- the ability to use or sell the asset once development has been
completed;

- the probability that the asset created will generate future economic
benefits;

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources
to complete the development; and

- the asset created can be separately identified and the development
cost can be measured reliably.

#### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2021


**2 Significant accounting policies continued**
The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible
assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when
the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised,
development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period
in which it is incurred.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible**
**assets excluding goodwill**
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts
of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating
unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount to the extent that the increased
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately
in the income statement.

**Inventories**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated
using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is
made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the
following categories:

- financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost (AC);

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss
(FVTPL); and

- financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value
including, where permitted, any directly attributable transaction costs.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in
their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending
on their classification.


**Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost**
Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash and
cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Cash and cash
equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access
restrictions, bank term deposits repayable on demand or maturing
within three months of inception.

At each reporting date the Group recognises a loss allowance for
expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised
cost. In establishing the appropriate amount of loss allowance to
be recognised, the Group applies either the general approach or the
simplified approach, depending on the nature of the underlying class
of financial assets:

- Under the general approach, the Group recognises a loss allowance
for a financial asset at an amount equal to the 12 month expected
credit losses, unless the credit risk on the financial asset has
increased significantly since initial recognition, in which case a loss
allowance is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime expected
credit losses.

- The simplified approach is applied to the impairment assessment
of trade and other receivables. Under this approach, the Group
recognises expected lifetime losses upon initial recognition.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include trade and other
payables, lease liabilities and borrowings. Borrowings are measured at
amortised cost unless they form part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The difference between the initial carrying amount of borrowings and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the
contractual terms using the effective interest rate method.

**Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value**
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through
profit or loss when they do not meet the criteria to be measured at
amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value
at the end of each reporting period with fair value gains or losses
recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a
designated hedging relationship (see below).

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to
manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk,
including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency options. Further details of derivative financial
instruments are set out in note 22.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their
fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or
loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in
which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

**Hedge accounting**
To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Group
designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in fair value
hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign
operations as appropriate.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether
the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group elected to continue to apply the
hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.


-----

**Fair value hedges**
The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign
currency risk.

The fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognised
in the income statement and is recognised in the same line as the
hedged item.

**Cash flow hedges**
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash
flow hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of
the hedged item from inception of the hedge.

Gains or losses relating to an ineffective portion are recognised
immediately in the income statement.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity are reclassified in the income statement in the
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line
as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast
transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are removed
from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the
non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the
hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss accumulated at that time in equity is recognised
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss in equity is recognised immediately in profit
or loss.

**Hedges of net investments in foreign operations**
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for
similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised
in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation
reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is
recognised immediately in the income statement.

Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective
portion of the hedge accumulated in the foreign currency translation
reserve are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the
foreign operation.

**Retirement benefit costs**
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are
recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service
entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed
retirement benefit schemes are treated as payments to defined
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes
are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is
calculated using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations carried out at the end of each reporting period.

Defined benefit costs are split into three categories, namely:

- service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost
and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;

- net interest expense; and

- remeasurements.

The Group presents service costs within cost of sales and
administrative expenses in its consolidated income statement.


Past service cost is recognised when the plan amendment or
curtailment occurs.

Net interest expense is recognised within finance costs and is calculated
by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return
on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in
the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not
subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.

**Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured
as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation
at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where
the effect is material.

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been
communicated to affected parties.

**Share-based payments**
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees. These are measured at the fair value of the equity
instruments at grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of
non-market-based vesting conditions. The fair value determined
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on
the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the
number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect
of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision
of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. The Group will on
occasion, at its own discretion, settle these share-based payments
in cash rather than equity.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for
the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of
the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and
at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured,
with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

**Alternative Performance Measures**
The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs) since its adoption of IFRS in 2005:

- Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from IFRS
profit measures; and

- EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and
depreciation from IFRS operating profit.

The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional
clarity for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the
Group’s narrative reporting. It is not intended to be a superior measure
to IFRS, however, these measures are used internally to manage
the business.

Further information and the reconciliation to the IFRS measures are
included in notes 4 and 5.

#### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2021


**2 Significant accounting policies continued**
**Critical accounting judgements and estimates**
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are
required to make judgements (other than those involving estimations)
that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised and to make
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that may have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
The assumptions for each estimate are set out in the relevant note
referenced below.

- Defined benefit obligation (note 26):
Calculation of the Group’s defined benefit obligation includes a
number of assumptions which impact the carrying value of the
obligation.

- Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets on acquisition:
In a business combination, intangible assets are identified and
recognised at fair value. The assumptions involved in valuing these
intangible assets require the use of estimates that may differ from
the actual outcome. These estimates cover future growth rates,
expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. Changing the
assumptions selected by management could significantly affect the
allocation of the purchase price paid between goodwill and other
acquired intangibles.

- Current tax liability and deferred tax (notes 10 and 11):
The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes
payable to various jurisdictions around the world and it also
recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s
interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant
court decisions.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting**
**policies**
During 2018, the European Commission (the Commission) initiated
an investigation into practices relating to the purchase of Styrene
monomer by companies, including Synthomer, operating in the
European Economic Area. The Company has and will continue to
fully cooperate with the Commission during its investigation. In prior
years given the ongoing investigation and the inherent uncertainties
associated with it, it was not possible to determine whether or not a
liability existed. Similarly, given the many variables in the Commission’s
fining framework and accordingly the range of possible outcomes,
the Directors were not able to reliably estimate any potential possible
liability. Therefore a contingent liability was disclosed in each set of
financial statements. Now based on the information available and the
resulting assessment of the expected outcome of the investigation
a provision of £57.2 million has been made in relation to this case.

There are no other critical judgements, apart from those involving
estimations (which are discussed above), that the Directors have made
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.


**3 Adoption of new and revised standards**
No new or revised accounting standards were adopted in the year.

In April 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee issued a new
interpretation in relation to accounting for customisation and
configuration costs of cloud computing arrangements. Following
a detailed review, it was confirmed that the new interpretation does
materially impact the accounting treatment for costs incurred on the
Group’s Pathway programme.

There are a number of other amendments and clarifications to IFRS,
effective in future years, which are not expected to significantly impact
the Group’s consolidated results or financial position.

**4 Special Items**
**IFRS and Underlying performance**
The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group
as a whole and as such include all sources of income and expense,
including both one-off items and those that do not relate to the
Group’s ongoing businesses. To provide additional clarity on the
ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses, management
uses ‘Underlying’ performance as an Alternative Performance
Measure to plan for, control and assess the performance of the
segments. Underlying performance differs from the IFRS
measures as it excludes Special Items.

**Special Items**
Special Items are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer
indication of the Group’s Underlying performance.

Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them in
the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to a distortion
of trends, or are technical adjustments which ensure the Group’s
financial statements are in compliance with IFRS but do not reflect the
operating performance of a segment in the year, or both. An example
of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which
principally relates to acquired customer relationships. The Group
incurs costs, which are recognised as an expense in the income
statement, in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group
considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on acquired
intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double
counting of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item
from Underlying performance.

The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special
Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s
Underlying performance:

- Restructuring and site closure costs;

- Sale of a business or significant asset;

- Acquisition costs;

- Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;

- Impairment of non-current assets;

- Fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments
where hedge accounting is not applied;

- Items of income and expense that are considered material, either by
their size and/or nature;

- Tax impact of above items; and

- Settlement of prior period tax issues.

Taxation Special Items 10 **8.8** **(4.9)**
Taxation on Special Items 10 **11.8** 20.5
**Total impact on profit for the year** **(115.6)** (124.1)

Amortisation of acquired intangibles increased in 2021, reflecting the first full year charge since the acquisition of OMNOVA Solutions Inc on
1 April 2020. The fair value of the intangible assets arising on the acquisition of OMNOVA amounting to £330.1 million are being amortised over
a period of 9–11 years mainly dependent on the characteristics of the customer relationships.

Restructuring and site closure costs in 2021 comprise:

- A £13.2 million charge in relation to the substantially completed integration of the OMNOVA acquisition net of a £1.2 million pension curtailment
credit in relation to the French business;

- A £11.6 million charge to demolish and rationalise assets at a small number of sites, to bring them into line with our ESG strategy; and

- A further £4.9 million for the completion of the rationalisation of the Group’s European Performance Materials network.
Restructuring and site closure costs in 2020 comprised £19.5 million for integration of OMNOVA, £20.9 million for the rationalisation of the
Group’s European Performance Materials network and £2.1 million to rationalise the Acrylate Monomers site.

Acquisition costs and related gains are for the acquisition of Eastman’s Adhesive Resins business and comprise £15.0 million of costs, mainly
professional adviser fees, offset by a £3.1 million gain on a foreign exchange derivative entered into in October 2021 to hedge the acquisition
price. Acquisition costs in 2020 related to the acquisition of OMNOVA.

Sale of business mainly comprised a further £7.1 million loss on the onerous contract for the disposal of Synthomer’s European Tyre Cord
business as production is relocated to Caojing (China) to enable the Marl 3 asset (Germany) to be fully closed. This is incremental to the charge
taken in 2020.

During 2018, the European Commission initiated an investigation into practices relating to the purchase of Styrene monomer by companies,
including Synthomer, operating in the European Economic Area. The Company has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Commission
during its investigation. Based on the information available and the resulting assessment of the expected outcome of the investigation a provision
of £57.2 million has been made in relation to this case.

In 2020, a £36.6 million impairment charge was booked relating to four sites.

In July 2018 the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix Euro interest rates on the full value of the then €440 million committed unsecured
revolving credit facility. The fair value movement of the unhedged interest rate derivatives relates to the movement in the mark-to-market of the
swap at 31 December 2021 in excess of the Group’s current borrowings.

Following the Group’s successful refinancing in 2020, capitalised debt costs relating to the 2018 refinancing and the 2019 bridge to bond were
written off, leading to a loss on extinguishment of £4.9 million.

Taxation Special Items comprised the release of uncertain tax provisions in relation to historical tax issues in France and Malaysia.

Taxation on Special Items is mainly deferred tax credits arising on the amortisation of acquired intangibles and restructuring and site
closure costs.

**Deferred tax liabilities not recognised**

No deferred tax liability has been recognised on temporary differences relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries of £71.7 million
(2020: £30.5 million), as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that the
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from
that business combination.

In March 2021, a £2.1 million measurement period adjustment was recognised, relating to the acquisition of OMNOVA Solutions Inc.

The allocation of the carrying value of goodwill is represented below:

**Total** 324.4 180.2 (1.3) (9.9) 493.4 **2.1** **(8.5)** **487.0**

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the
discount rate, profitability and growth rate. These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the Group. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk
premium attributable to a particular CGU’s activities and geography of operation. A pre-tax discount rate of 10.2% has been used in the above
calculations for each CGU (2020: 9.7%).

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for each CGU, derived from the most recent five-year business plans approved by the Board. The final
year cash flow is then assumed to apply into perpetuity with estimated annual growth rates of 3.1%, 1.9% and 2.0% for Performance Elastomers,
Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities respectively (2020: 1.7%, 1.6% and 1.6% for Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and
Industrial Specialities respectively). These rates do not exceed average long-term growth rates for relevant markets.

A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on these impairment tests, with scenarios covering increased cost of capital, the impact of potential
carbon taxes, reduced margins and reduction in customer demand. For each CGU, the Directors believe that there is no reasonably possible
change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based that would cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

As disclosed in note 2, there are various conditions required by IAS 38 for an internally generated intangible asset to be recognised.

During the year the Group invested a further £12.9 million in its Pathway programme (2020: £12.2 million). This programme is designed to deliver
a unified operating model on a single set of integrated systems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group. The investment in this
programme was shown as an asset under construction until the deployment phase began.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Before accepting a new customer, the Group uses appropriate procedures to assess the potential customer’s credit quality in order to set a
credit limit.

The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised cost, using the lifetime
expected loss provision. The expected credit loss on trade receivables is estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default
experience and credit rating, adjusted as appropriate for current observable data. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk,
with exposure spread over a large number of customers. The following table details the risk profile of trade receivables based on the Group’s
provision matrix.

Note:
1. AC: amortised cost; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in note 2.

The fair value of the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2021 was £629.4 million (31 December 2020: £675.2 million).

**Financial risk management**
The Group’s policies, approved by the Board, provide written principles on financial risk management and the use of financial derivatives.
These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has a policy of hedging significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at operating company level. The Group regularly reviews
its net assets and borrowing currency exposures, borrowing in overseas currencies in order to hedge the net assets held in those currencies as
appropriate. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

**Currency risk**
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many currencies. As a result, it is subject to
foreign currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the Group’s transactions and the translation of the results and underlying
net assets of its operations.

To manage the currency risk the Group uses foreign currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets,
which are predominantly denominated in Euros, US dollars and Malaysian ringgits. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group’s
policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to
disclose (2020: none).

**Interest rate risk**
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar and Euro interest rates. To manage interest rate risk,
the Group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings, and utilises interest rate swaps. These practices aim to minimise the
Group’s net finance charges with acceptable year-on-year volatility.

At 31 December 2021 the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on €440 million of borrowings.

The Group’s interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges with fair value movement on the hedged portion recognised in equity.
Interest paid on these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, within Underlying interest costs. Fair value movement in the unhedged
portion is also recognised in profit and loss, as a Special Item.

After taking account of interest rate swaps, the Group’s currency and interest rate exposure as at 31 December 2021 was:

**2021** 2020

**borrowings** **borrowings** **borrowings** borrowings borrowings borrowings

**Total** **192.1** **437.3** **629.4** 200.8 474.4 675.2


-----

**Market risk sensitivity analysis**
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Group uses a sensitivity analysis that
estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease
of 1.0% in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at
31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 with all other variables remaining constant. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market
risks on the net post employment benefit liabilities and assets, and corporate tax payable. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as
interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.

Malaysian ringgit exchange rate -/+ 10% **0.5** **0.5** **–** – – –

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the
balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

For interest rate derivatives the mark-to-market adjustment, and amount recognised in equity as part of a hedging arrangement, is estimated
using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at
the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations
within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.

**Credit risk**
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises
on cash balances, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date as disclosed at the start of this
note. A financial asset is in default when the counterparty fails to pay its contractual obligations. Financial assets are written-off when there is no
reasonable expectation of recovery. Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business-related credit exposures.

**Financial credit risk**
Synthomer aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board.
Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and financial institutions with a credit rating of investment grade and the policy restricts
the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits. The Group’s policy is designed to ensure that individual counterparty limits are
adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be
transacted. Synthomer annually reviews the credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties’ credit quality, reflecting market credit
conditions.

**Business related credit risk**
Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and active risk management is applied,
focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and monitoring procedures. There is no significant concentration of credit risk
with respect to receivables as the Group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed. See note 20 for information on
credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables.

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that Synthomer is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, or that it is unable, on an ongoing basis, to borrow
funds at an acceptable price to fund actual or proposed commitments. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves,
banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity
profiles of assets and liabilities.

The financial covenant at 31 December 2021 for the RCF is that net debt must be less than 4.0 times EBITDA. At 31 December 2021 the actual
covenant for the net debt was 0.3 times EBITDA.

Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Synthomer’s financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with
respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity
on certain borrowings and the inability to access committed facilities. Synthomer was in full compliance with its financial covenants in respect of
its borrowings throughout each of the years presented.

At the year end, Synthomer had undrawn committed bank facilities as follows:

**2021** 2020

**Expiring** Expiring

**2 and 5** 2 and 5

**595.0** **595.0** 397.0 397.0

**Fair value measurement**
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.

As prescribed by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the inputs are as follows:

- Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2 – not level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly.

- Level 3 – not based on observable market data.

Interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate
inputs such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which are used in a discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instrument’s
term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in active
markets, all of the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 financial instruments.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps is estimated by discounting the future contractual
cash flows using forward exchange rates, interest rates and prices at the balance sheet date.

There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the current or prior year.


-----

**Hedge relationships**
The Group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. Strengths of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is
analysed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of timing, cash flows or
value except when the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned. The change in the credit risk of the hedging
instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the economic relationship.

The notional amounts, contractual maturities and rates of the hedging instruments designated in hedging relationships as of 31 December 2021
by the main risk categories are as follows:

Hedged risk Notional amount Maturity Range of hedged rates
**2021**
**Cash flow hedges**
Interest rate swap Interest rate Up to €440m 28/08/2018 – 28/08/2025 0.517% to 0.535% fixed
**Net investment hedges**
Net investment Currency Up to €560m 01/04/2020 – present 1.11 – 1.20
Net investment Currency Up to $370m 01/04/2020 – present 1.33 – 1.42
2020
Cash flow hedges
Interest rate swap Interest rate Up to €440m 28/08/2018 – 28/08/2025 0.517% to 0.535% fixed
Net investment hedges
Net investment Currency Up to €560m from 01/04/2020 1.08 – 1.15
Net investment Currency Up to $370m from 01/04/2020 1.23 – 1.37

Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.

The ratio for hedging instruments designated in both net investment and cash flow hedge relationships was 1:1. Ineffectiveness could occur on
either hedging relationship due to significant changes in counterparty credit risk or a reduction in the notional amount of the hedged item during
the designated hedging period.

**Cash flow hedges**
The Group designated as a cash flow hedge the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on its Euro borrowings.

In 2021 a gain of £3.4 million (2020: £0.8 million loss) was recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in respect of these derivatives.
At 31 December 2021 the cash flow hedge reserve includes a cumulative loss of £10.0 million (2020: loss of £13.4 million), all of which relates to
continuing cash flow hedges. The cash flows are expected to occur between 2022 and 2025.

In the year, the Group’s borrowings fell below the total of the interest rate derivative contracts, leading to a reduction in the balance designated as
a cash flow hedge. The change in fair value relating to the unhedged portion of the interest rate swaps was a gain of £6.2 million (2020: loss of
£3.6 million) which was recognised in the income statement within finance costs as a Special Item.

**Capital management**
The Board is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the business so as to deliver continued
improvement in the return from those investments and by managing the capital structure.

Synthomer manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency and to provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle and give
efficient access to debt markets at attractive cost levels. This is achieved by targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio between 1.0 and 2.0. In order to
finance acquisitions, the Group may increase the ratio to 3.0, with deleveraging within 12-24 months.

As at 31 December 2021 the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.3 times (2020: 1.8 times).

The Board maintains a dividend policy to 2.5 times earnings cover. Should excess capital not be deployed for acquisitions or capital expenditure,
the Board will periodically consider one-off capital returns to shareholders in order to maintain an efficient balance sheet.

**23 Lease liabilities**
The Group has a portfolio of leases mainly comprising land and buildings, chemical storage tanks and vehicles. Further details are given in note 2.

Information in respect of right of use assets, including the carrying amount, additions and depreciation, are set out in note 17 to these financial
statements. Information in respect of the carrying value is set out below and information in respect of interest arising on lease liabilities is set out
in note 9.

Synthomer also enters into short-term leases and low value leases which are not recognised as right of use assets and lease liabilities.
The expense recognised in the year in relation to these leases is not material. Synthomer has no material exposure to variable lease payments,
extension options or committed leases not yet commenced.

The total cash outflow for leases in the year was as follows:

**2021** 2020
**£m** £m
Payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities **9.7** 9.7
Payments for the interest portion of lease liabilities **1.5** 1.6

the disposal of the European Tyre Cord business. In the year, a £5.1 million provision was recognised for the closure of OMNOVA’s administrative
and R&D site in Villejust (France). A £11.6 million provision was recognised to demolish and rationalise assets at a small number of sites, to bring
them into line with our ESG strategy.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations**
The Group operates a variety of retirement benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.

**Defined contribution schemes**
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees. Costs recognised in respect of defined contribution pension
plans across the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 were £10.9 million (2020: £9.2 million).

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is re-insured with an external
insurance company.

**Multi-employer schemes**
The Group participates in several tariffs of the Pensionskasse Degussa in Germany, which is a multi-employer pension scheme.
Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing. The assets of all participating
employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience. Therefore sufficient information is not
available to identify the Group’s share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the Group accounts for the scheme on a defined
contribution basis. The Group expects to make a regular contribution of £2.4 million to the scheme in 2022.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable based on an actuarial assessment of each participating
employer’s share of the future benefit accrual. At 31 December 2021 there is no indication of any commitment for additional deficit contributions
in excess of regular contributions.

**Defined benefit schemes**
**UK**
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the Company. The trustees of the pension fund
are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension scheme are
responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009 and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined contribution
scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. A triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was
undertaken in 2021 and is in the process of being finalised by the trustees of the scheme and the Company.

**USA**
The Group’s US defined benefit scheme was acquired as part of the OMNOVA acquisition and is administered by a fund which is legally separate
from OMNOVA Solutions Inc. The fiduciary committee is required by law to act in the interest of the fund and is responsible for the investment
policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2011 and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined contribution
scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned and a formal valuation is undertaken on an
annual basis.

**Germany**
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany. These schemes are closed to new members. In line with common
practice, these schemes are unfunded and liabilities are settled on a cash basis as they fall due. At each balance sheet date, obligations are
calculated by external actuaries.

**Other**
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and retirement benefit schemes. For the funded schemes, assets are held separately
from those of the Group. The aggregated pension disclosures for the other defined benefit schemes have been compiled from a number of
actuarial valuations at 31 December 2021.

#### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2021

**26 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
**Retirement benefit risks**
Defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets
underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase
in the value of the plan assets in bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy
will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

Charges to the income statement in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are as follows:

**2021** 2020

The Group remains committed to funding the deficits for the UK and US defined benefit schemes.

Following the 2018 triennial valuation of the UK scheme, which completed in 2019, the Company committed to paying contributions for the
period to 5 April 2023, increasing from £16.4 million in the year commencing 6 April 2019 to £18.2 million for the year commencing 6 April 2022.
Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be £17.9 million in 2022. The 2021 triennial valuation will be completed in 2022.

The defined benefit obligation of the US scheme was £73.4 million on acquisition. This has reduced to £27.7 million at 31 December 2021.
The Group is currently contributing $6 million per annum to help reduce this deficit.

The Group’s other defined benefit schemes are largely unfunded, with minimal plan assets. Liabilities from these schemes are settled on a cash
basis as they fall due.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
**Actuarial assumptions**
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2021** 2020

**UK** **USA** **Germany** **Other** UK USA Germany Other
**%** **%** **%** **%** % % % %
Rate of increase in pensions in payment **3.20** **0.00** **1.00** **2.00–3.40** 2.80 0.00 1.00 1.90–2.75
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment **2.90** **0.00** **2.50** **2.00–3.40** 2.20 0.00 2.50 1.50–2.75
Discount rate **1.80** **2.66** **1.20** **0.27–2.48** 1.40 2.19 0.70 (0.80)–1.94
Inflation assumption **3.40** **0.00** **1.75** **1.20–2.00** 2.90 0.00 1.75 1.00–2.00

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. Mortality assumptions are based
on country-specific mortality tables and, where appropriate, include an allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. In addition, where
credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. The Group’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and
Germany where, using the mortality tables adopted, the expected lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at age
65 in 20 years’ time is as follows:

**2021** 2020

**Retiring today** **Retiring in 20 years** Retiring today Retiring in 20 years

**UK** **USA** **Germany** **UK** **USA** **Germany** UK USA Germany UK USA Germany
Male **87.2** **86.4** **85.5** **88.8** **87.4** **88.2** 87.3 86.4 85.3 88.9 87.3 88.1
Female **89.5** **87.5** **88.9** **90.9** **88.5** **91.1** 89.5 87.4 88.8 91.4 88.4 91.0

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 14.9 years for the UK scheme (2020: 16.2 years),
10.7 years for the US scheme (2020: 11.3 years) and 17.2 years for the German schemes (2020: 18.4 years).

**Sensitivity analysis**
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality. The sensitivity analysis
below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, assuming
that all other assumptions are held constant:

**Increase in scheme liabilities**

**UK** **USA** **Germany**
**£m** **£m** **£m**
Discount rate (decrease of 1%) **72** **23** **14**
Future mortality rate (one year increase in expectancy) **19** **7** **3**

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur
and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to
significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

**Cash flow hedging reserve**
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.
The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss only when the hedged transaction impacts the
profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the applicable accounting policy.

**Translation reserve**
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries only, from their
functional currency into the parent’s functional currency, being sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. Gains and losses on
hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are included in the translation reserve.

The total exercise price for all the above grants is £nil.

For options outstanding as at 31 December 2021, the exercise price was £nil and the weighted average remaining contractual life was 4.95 years
(2020: 5.16 years).

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £4.64 (2020: £2.83).

The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £3.60 (2020: £1.94). The valuation was
based on the following inputs and assumptions, using a Monte Carlo simulation model:

**2021** 2020
Weighted average share price (£) **4.68** 2.59
Option price (£) **–** –
Value of optionality **nil** nil
Vesting assumption **77%** 75%

The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and is based on market
conditions and management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.

The Group also operates a cash-settled share-based payment scheme for which there was an expense in the year of £1.8 million
(2020: £2.4 million) and for which there was a liability at the year end of £4.0 million (2020: £2.9 million).

## Independent auditors’ report

to the members of Synthomer plc


### Report on the audit of the financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

**• Synthomer plc’s group financial statements and company**

financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true
and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the group’s loss and
the group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

**• the group financial statements have been properly prepared**

in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act 2006;

**• the company financial statements have been properly**

prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework”, and applicable law); and

**• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance**

with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the
Annual Report 2022 (the “Annual Report”), which comprise:
the Consolidated balance sheet and the Company statement
of financial position as at 31 December 2022; the Consolidated
income statement, the Consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Company
statements of changes in equity, the Consolidated cash flow
statement and the Reconciliation of net cash flow from
operating activities to movement in net debt for the year then
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which
include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the
Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described
in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**
We remained independent of the group in accordance with
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard
were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services
to the company in the period under audit


**Our audit approach**

**Overview**
Audit scope

**• Audit procedures provide coverage of 79% of revenue and 75%**

of underlying operating profit.

**• Audit scope covers eight countries, performing procedures**
over 13 components.

**• Financially significant components in the USA and Germany.**

Key audit matters

**• Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (group)**

**• Valuation of defined benefit pension liabilities and level 3**

assets (group)

**• Presentation of Special Items (group)**

**• Fair value accounting associated with the Adhesive**
Technologies acquisition (group)

**• Recoverability of investment in, and amounts owed by,**
group undertakings (parent)

Materiality

**• Overall group materiality: £11,743,000 (2021: £11,605,000)**

based on approximately 5% of three year weighted average of
underlying profit before taxation (2021: three year weighted
average of underlying profit before taxation).

**• Overall company materiality: £10,568,000 (2021: £10,444,500)**

based on 1% of total assets capped at 90% of Group
materiality.

**• Performance materiality: £8,807,000 (2021: £8,703,000)**

(group) and £7,926,000 (2021: £7,830,000) (company).

**The scope of our audit**
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

**Key audit matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including
those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any
comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon,
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and fair value
accounting associated with the Adhesive Technologies
acquisition are new key audit matters this year. Uncertain tax
provisions, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer
included because of no significant changes to the
methodologies or tax provisions in the year. Otherwise, the key
audit matters below are consistent with last year.


-----

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


**Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (group)**

As set out in note 14, the group had goodwill of £480.8m
(2021: £487.0m) at 31 December 2022, after an
impairment of (£133.7m) (2021: £nil). As set out in note 15,
the group had acquired intangible assets of £523.6m
(2021: £297.6m) at 31 December 2022. As set out in Note
16, the group had other intangible assets of £60.9m (2021:
£46.4m) at 31 December 2022. These are significant in the
context of the overall balance sheet of the group. We
consider this to be a key audit matter because the
estimates underlying the recoverability of goodwill and
intangible assets are subject to high estimation
uncertainty, particularly in a year where an impairment has
been identified. As fair value less cost to sell result in a
lower amount, we focused our audit effort on the “value-inuse” calculations supporting the valuation of goodwill and
other intangible assets. Management’s assessment of the
“value in use" of the group's cash generating units involves
judgements about the future results of the businesses,
particularly assumptions around growth rates and the
discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts,
where there is a higher degree of sensitivity.

**Valuation of defined benefit pension liabilities**
**and level 3 assets (group)**

As set out in note 26, the group had £73.4m (2021:
£122.4m) net liabilities as at 31 December 2022 in relation
to defined benefit pension schemes. These primarily
represent the Yule Catto group retirement benefits scheme
in the UK with a net asset position of £5.9m (2021: net
liabilities of £4.6m), the OMNOVA Solutions Consolidated
Pension Plan in the US with net liabilities of £10.6m (2021:
net liabilities of £27.7m) and an unfunded scheme in
Germany with net liabilities of £57.7m (2021: net liabilities
of 74.7m). The group uses third party actuaries to calculate
pension liabilities. The valuation of these liabilities is based
on a number of assumptions and the calculation is highly
sensitive to small changes in the assumptions. For
instance, changes in inflation, mortality tables and
discount rate can have a significant impact on the
valuation of the liability recorded. The UK pension scheme
ended up in a net asset position for the first time, the
recognition of such assets is judgemental. The pension
asset also contains level 3 and other complex assets
(complex PIVs where assets are not traded on Recognised
Investment Exchanges (RIE)) totalling £39m as at
31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: £266m), which are
complex in nature to value and therefore we deem there to
be a risk with respect to the valuation of these assets.


Procedures performed included:

**• Understanding business processes and controls related to the**
assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
for impairment.

**• Assessing the reasonableness of the impairment model and**
understanding management's process and judgements utilised for
developing estimates and assumptions. This included testing of the
underlying “value-in-use” calculations.

**• Performing a retrospective review of the prior period estimates by**
comparing this to actual results in the current period.

**• Engaging our internal valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness**
of the weighted average cost of capital and growth rate assumptions
used by management.

**• Assessing corroborating or contradictory evidence relating to significant**

assumptions in the cash flow projections.

**• Performing sensitivity analyses based on reasonably possible outcomes.**

**• Checking the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.**

**• Assessing management’s calculation of fair value less cost to sell using**
forecast cash flows and the market multiple used by Synthomer in their
original valuation, noting that this was lower than the calculated value in use.

**• Assessing management’s impairment assessment on assets other than**
goodwill, because of the goodwill impairment recognised, to determine
whether any of these assets should be impaired as well.

**• Assessing the impact of climate change included in management’s**
cashflow forecast.

**• Reviewing the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the**

carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Based on the
procedures performed, we noted no material issues from our work other
than the impairment recognised.

In order to assess the identified risks we:

**• We reviewed external actuarial reports of the UK and German schemes**
which set out the calculations and assumptions underpinning the year end
pension scheme liabilities valuation and our US component team reviewed
an external actuarial report for the US scheme.

**• We (and PwC US) held discussions with the external actuaries and were**
satisfied that the scope of their work was such that we could use this work
to provide evidence for the purpose of our audit.

**• We assessed the competency and objectivity of the external actuaries to**

perform the year end calculations by considering their technical expertise
and independence from the group.

**• We used our own specialist actuarial team to evaluate the key assumptions**
used in each of the three schemes by comparing these assumptions to our
expectations for similar schemes as at the year end.

**• We reviewed section 14.8 of “Constitutional rules” of the UK pension scheme**

and concluded that the net asset of the UK scheme could be recognised.

**• With respect to the level 3 and other more complex assets, we tested values**
through a combination of the following procedures: reviewed audited
accounts of pooled investment vehicles; reviewed internal control reports of
the service provider responsible for the valuation of the fund, including
obtaining bridging letters where the control report does not cover the
current financial period of Synthomer plc; obtained fund transactions close
to the year end (where available), and obtained third party confirmation from
the investment managers.

**• We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures within the**
financial statements. We noted no material issues from the above procedures.

to the members of Synthomer plc

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


**Presentation of Special Items (group)**

The group presents two measures of performance in the
income statement; statutory and underlying, the latter after
adjusting for certain items of income or expenses, as
management believes these measures provide additional
useful information on the underlying trends, performance
and position of the group. The determination of which
items of income or expense are classified as Special items
is subject to judgement and therefore users of the financial
statements could be misled if amounts are not classified
or calculated appropriately. Description of the amounts
presented as Special items are included in note 4 to the
financial statements.

**Fair value accounting associated with the Adhesive**
**Technologies acquisition (group)**

As set out in note 30, the group completed the acquisition
of Eastman's Adhesive Resins business on 1 April 2022 for
a total consideration of £779.1m. Management engaged
experts to perform a purchase price allocation (“PPA”)
exercise in relation to intangibles, plant and equipment
and inventory. The allocation of the purchase price to the
acquired assets and liabilities is considered to be a key
audit matter as the identification of the acquired assets
and liabilities, and their subsequent valuation, recognition
and measurement, is based to a large extent on estimates
and assumptions involving a high degree of judgement.

**Recoverability of investment in, and amounts owed**
**by, group undertakings (parent)**

As disclosed in notes 3 and 6 of the parent company's
financial statements, the company held an investment in
subsidiaries of £733.4m (2021: £537.6m) and amounts
owed by group undertakings of £1,987.3m (2021:
£1,275.0m) at 31 December 2022. The assessment of the
recoverability of these assets required the application of
management judgement, particularly in determining
whether any impairment indicators have arisen that trigger
the need for a formal impairment assessment and in
assessing whether the carrying value of each investment
and amounts owed by group undertakings are recoverable.
As changes to these judgements and estimates could have
a material impact on the company's financial statements,
we consider this to be a key audit matter.


We considered the appropriateness of amounts classified as Special
items. To do this we considered:

**• The group's accounting policy on special items and Pronouncements by**
the Financial Reporting Council on this matter.

**• We assessed the income and expenses classified as special items**

against the group's accounting policies.

**• We challenged management on the appropriateness of the classification**

of such Special items, being mindful that classification should be
even-handed between gains and losses, the basis of the classification
should be clearly disclosed and a clear reconciliation to statutory
measures provided and applied consistently one year to the next.

**• We challenged management on the quantum of the Special items, and**

the estimates underpinning them. Having considered the nature and
quantum of these items, overall we are satisfied that the presentation of
special items in the financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2022 is materially appropriate.

Our procedures included the following:

**• Assessing the business processes and controls related to the purchase**
price allocation.

**• Reviewing the purchase agreement with a focus on unusual terms and**
conditions and more complex forms of consideration.

**• Comparing the identified assets and liabilities with other sources of**

information, such as Board presentations, that might suggest omitted
items.

**• Obtaining the report prepared by management's expert used to value**
certain of the acquired assets and utilising our own specialists to assess
the valuation techniques, assumptions and source data, used to
determine these fair values.

**• Evaluating the allocation of the purchase price to the relative fair values**
of the assets and liabilities acquired.

**• Considering the appropriateness of the disclosures within the financial**

statements. Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material
issues from our work.

Our procedures included the following:

**• Assessing the recoverable value by reference to the net assets of the**
underlying subsidiaries and amounts owed by group undertakings with
reference to the director’s intentions for the settlement of group-wide
intercompany balances.

**• Assessing the impact of climate change included in management’s**
cashflow forecast.

**• Verifying that the recoverable values of the investment was consistent**
with the recoverable value of the CGUs tested for goodwill impairment
purposes, leveraging the audit work undertaken as part of the group
audit. Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues
from our work.


-----

**How we tailored the audit scope**
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of
the group and the company, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which they operate.

As set out in note 5 'Segmental analysis', the group reports its
results as five segments: 'Performance Elastomers', 'Functional
Solutions', 'Industrial Specialities', 'Adhesive Technologies' and
'Acrylate Monomers'. The group's financial statements are a
consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies,
intermediate holding companies and operating companies,
across 24 countries. Two countries, being the USA and
Germany, account for a significant portion of the group's
results. We accordingly focused our work on two of the
reporting units in these countries, which were subject to audits
of their complete financial information. In addition, to increase
our coverage of the group's revenue and underlying profit
before tax we performed full scope audit procedures at an
additional eleven reporting units located in the UK, Italy,
Germany, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Austria and France.
These components accounted for 79% of the group's revenue,
75% of the group's underlying operating profit.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we
determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the
audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group's financial
statements as a whole. During the audit, senior members of the
group team held a number of meetings with the audit teams
from key reporting units in the UK, Germany, Malaysia and the
USA, and reviewed the work performed by these teams over
those areas of higher audit risk. The group audit partner also
visited Malaysia as part of the audit planning process.

**The impact of climate risk on our audit**
As part of our audit we made enquiries of management to
understand the process management has adopted to assess
the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the group’s
financial statements and support the disclosures made within
the TCFD report. In addition to enquiries with management, we


also read the governance processes in place to assess climate
risk. We challenged the completeness of management’s
climate risk assessment by reading the group’s website /
communications for details of climate related impacts.
Management have made commitments to achieve net zero
carbon emissions by 2050, and with Vision 2030 they are
working on their pathway towards this. Management considers
the impact of climate risk does not give rise to a potential
material financial statement impact. Using our knowledge of
the business we evaluated management’s risk assessment and
its estimates as set out in note 2 of the financial statements
and resulting disclosures where significant. We considered
impairment of non-current assets, specially impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets, as the area to potentially be
materially impacted by climate risk and consequently we
focused our audit work in this area. To respond to the audit
risks identified in this area we tailored our audit approach to
address these, in particular, we challenged management on
how the impact of climate commitments made by the group
would impact the assumptions within the discounted cash
flows prepared by management that are used in the group’s
impairment analysis. We also considered the consistency of
the disclosures in relation to climate change (including the
disclosures in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) section) within the Annual Report with
the financial statements and our knowledge obtained from our
audit. Our procedures did not identify any material impact in the
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, or
our key audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2022.

**Materiality**
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations,
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate
on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:


**Financial statements – group** **Financial statements – company**

Overall materiality £11,743,000 (2021: £11,605,000) £10,568,000 (2021: £10,444,500)


How we approximately 5% of three year weighted average of
determined it underlying profit before taxation (2021: three year
weighted average of underlying profit before taxation)

Rationale for We believe that underlying profit before taxation,
benchmark applied being profit before tax adjusted for special items, is a
key metric for investors and is used by the Board in
measuring the Group's financial performance.


1% of total assets capped at 90% of Group
materiality

We believe that total assets is the primary measure
used by the shareholders in assessing the performance
of the company, and is a generally accepted
benchmark. The value is capped for the purpose of
the Group audit with reference to Group materiality.


-----

##### Independent auditors’ report continued

to the members of Synthomer plc

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across
components was between £1,300,000 to £8,000,000. Certain
components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality
that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and
undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically,
we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our
audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances,
classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining
sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of
overall materiality, amounting to £8,807,000 (2021: £8,703,000) for
the group financial statements and £7,926,000 (2021: £7,830,000)
for the company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a
number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk
assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of
controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of
our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to
them misstatements identified during our audit above £587,000
(group audit) (2021: £380,000) and £528,000 (company audit)
(2021: £522,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

Our evaluation of the members’ assessment of the group's and
the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting included:

**• We reviewed the directors model supporting their going**
concern assumption. We discussed with management the
assumptions applied in the going concern review so we could
understand and challenge the rationale for those assumptions,
using our knowledge of the business. We tested the model’s
mathematical accuracy and considered the reasonableness of
the revenue and cost assumptions made and the available
headroom throughout a period of at least twelve months from
the date of approval of the financial statements.

**• We reviewed management’s sensitivity scenarios including**
their severe but plausible downside. We considered potential
mitigating actions available to the group that are achievable
and within management’s control. We then assessed the
availability of liquid resources under the different scenarios
and the associated covenant tests applicable; and

**• We also assessed additional downside sensitivities and**
considered the impact on covenants and liquidity headroom.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified
any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the
group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the
members’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.


However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's
and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the members’ reporting on how they have applied
the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material
to add or draw attention to in relation to the members’
statement in the financial statements about whether the
members considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the members
with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
auditors’ report thereon. The members are responsible for the
other information, which includes reporting based on the Task
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
recommendations. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or
material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing
to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK
Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the
Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions
and matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors’ Report**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of
the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and
Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2022 is
consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and
company and their environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the
Strategic report and Directors' report.

**Directors’ Remuneration**
In our opinion, the part of the Annual report on remuneration to
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.


-----

**Corporate governance statement**

The Listing Rules require us to review the members’ statements
in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part
of the corporate governance statement relating to the
company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional
responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance
statement as other information are described in the Reporting
on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have
concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate
governance statement, included within the Governance report
is materially consistent with the financial statements and our
knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing
material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

**• The members’ confirmation that they have carried out a**

robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;

**• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those**
principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify
emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being
managed or mitigated;

**• The members’ statement in the financial statements about**

whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s
and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the
financial statements;

**• The members’ explanation as to their assessment of the**
group's and company’s prospects, the period this assessment
covers and why the period is appropriate; and

**• The members’ statement as to whether they have a**
reasonable expectation that the company will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due
over the period of its assessment, including any related
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications
or assumptions.

Our review of the members’ statement regarding the longerterm viability of the group and company was substantially less
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries
and considering the members’ process supporting their
statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the
relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and
considering whether the statement is consistent with the
financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of
the group and company and their environment obtained in the
course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit,
we have concluded that each of the following elements of the
corporate governance statement is materially consistent with
the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during
the audit:

**• The members’ statement that they consider the Annual**
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable,
and provides the information necessary for the members to
assess the group’s and company's position, performance,
business model and strategy;



**• The section of the Annual Report that describes the review**
of effectiveness of risk management and internal control
systems; and

**• The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the**
Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to
report when the members’ statement relating to the company’s
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under
the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and**
**the audit**

**Responsibilities of the members for the financial statements**
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors'
responsibilities, the members are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a
true and fair view. The members are also responsible for such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the members are
responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the members either intend to
liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial**
**statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance
with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with
our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we
identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to breaches of environmental, health
and safety and competition regulations, and we considered the
extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on
the financial statements. We also considered those laws and
regulations that have a direct impact on the financial
statements such as the Companies Act 2006, UK tax legislation
and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to material


-----

##### Independent auditors’ report continued

to the members of Synthomer plc

component teams. We evaluated management’s incentives
and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial
statements (including the risk of override of controls), and
determined that the principal risks were related to posting
inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue and
management bias in accounting estimates. The group
engagement team shared this risk assessment with the
component auditors so that they could include appropriate
audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit
procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or
component auditors included:

**• Discussions with management and internal audit, including**
consideration of known or suspected instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations and fraud;

**• Evaluation of management's controls designed to prevent**
and detect irregularities;

**• Challenging assumptions and judgements made by**

management in their significant accounting estimates, in
particular in relation to impairment of goodwill, going concern
and viability and the valuation of defined benefit scheme
liabilities. Where we considered appropriate, we held
discussions with the Group’s legal advisors;

**• Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal**

entries posted with unusual account combinations (for
example credit to revenue with a debit entry to an unexpected
account) or journals posted by senior management.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described
above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of
non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely
related to events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of
certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing
techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited
number of items for testing, rather than testing complete
populations. We will often seek to target particular items for
testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases,
we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion
about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms
part of our auditors’ report.

**Use of this report**
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

31 December 2022


**1 General information**

Synthomer plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company
incorporated in the United Kingdom and registered in
England under the Companies Act. The address of the
registered office is given on page 221. The Company is
listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries
(the ‘Group’) and the nature of the Group’s operations are
set out in the Strategic report.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in
pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the
policies set out in note 2.

**New and amended standards adopted by the Group**
There are no standards or interpretations that are not yet
effective and that would be expected to have a material
impact on the entity in the current or future reporting
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**2** **Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International
Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting
under those standards and the disclosure guidance and
transparency rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s
Financial Conduct Authority.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis and under the historical cost basis, except for
the revaluation of financial instruments that are measured
at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained
in the accounting policies below.

The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.

**Going concern**
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements
through its bank facilities. The current economic conditions
continue to create uncertainty, particularly over the level of
demand for the Group’s products. The Group’s forecasts and
projections take account of reasonably possible changes in
trading performance, and a severe but plausible downside
scenario has been prepared, linked to our principal risks. Various
mitigating actions have also been identified so that, should such
a scenario crystallise, the Group could take action quickly to
significantly reduce costs and cash outflows, as demonstrated
during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The severe but plausible downside scenario, offset by
mitigation actions as required, does not threaten the Group’s
ability to operate within the level of its current facilities.
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters
discussed in connection with the viability statement see
page 90, the Directors therefore considered it appropriate to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing its
consolidated financial statements. Further information on
the Group’s borrowings is given in note 21.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the Company and entities controlled


by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December
each year. Control is achieved when the Company:

**• has the power over the investee;**

**• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its**
involvement with the investee; and

**• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.**

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins from the date the
Company obtains control and ceases from the date the
Company loses control. Where necessary on obtaining
control, adjustments are made to the financial statements
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with
those used by the Group.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified
separately from the Group’s equity therein. Subsequent to
the date on which the Company obtains control, the carrying
amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling
interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income,
expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between
members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.

**Business combinations**
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted
for using the acquisition method. The consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair
value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date
fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities
incurred by the Group to former owners of the acquiree and
the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

At acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value, except that:

**• deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and**
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes;

**• liabilities or assets related to employee benefit**

arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits; and

**• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for**

sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held
for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in
accordance with that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those
provisional amounts are adjusted during a measurement
period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are
recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date
that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised
as of that date.

A measurement period is the period from the date of
acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s
previously held interest in the acquired entity is remeasured

to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or
loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.

**Goodwill**
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in acquisition-date
identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at
least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating
units expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. Cash generating units are defined as our
reportable segments: Performance Elastomers, Functional
Solutions, Industrial Specialities, Acrylate Monomers and
Adhesive Technologies.

Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated
are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset
in the unit. An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed
in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill
arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS
has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date.

Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to
1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

**Joint ventures**
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Under the equity method, interests in joint
ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted
thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the postacquisition profits or losses and movements in other
comprehensive income.

**Revenue**
General
Synthomer manufactures and sells mainly water-based
polymers across a diverse range of end use applications.
Our products are predominantly sold in liquid form, in bulk
containers.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which
the Group expects to be entitled in a contract with a
customer when performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenue is recognised at the point in time when control of
the product is transferred from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant
asset in line with the Incoterms under which it is sold. The
significant majority of Synthomer’s products are sold under
Carriage Paid To (CPT) and Carriage and Insurance Paid
(CIP) International Commercial Terms. Under these terms,
control of the product is transferred when the goods reach


their destination. At this point the risks of obsolescence and
loss have been transferred and there is no unfulfilled
obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of
the product. A receivable is recognised at this point in time
as consideration is unconditional and only the passage of
time is required before payment is due.

Rebates
Synthomer may grant customers rebates if the goods
purchased by the customer exceed a contractually defined
threshold within the specified period. Rebates are usually
deducted from the amounts payable by the customer.
Depending on the terms of the underlying contract,
Synthomer uses either the expected value or the most likely
amount to estimate the variable consideration for expected
future rebates. Historical, current and forecast information
is considered when calculating rebates.
The majority of rebate programmes are aligned with the
Group’s financial year end, providing certainty around how
much should be recognised in the financial statements.

Other
The Group does not have any contracts where the period
between the transfer of promised goods to the customer
and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a
consequence, the Group applies the practical expedient in
IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of the transaction prices
for the time value of money.

**Foreign currencies**
In preparing the financial statements of the individual
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
functional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the
period in which they arise except for:

**• exchange differences on transactions entered into to**
hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under
‘hedge accounting’); and

**• exchange differences on monetary items receivable or**
payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is
neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable
future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the
foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other
comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to
profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
non-sterling operations are translated at exchange rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense
items are translated at the average exchange rates for the
period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a
separate component of equity.


-----

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group
elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterlingdenominated assets and liabilities.

**Operating profit and loss**
Operating profit and loss represents profit and loss from
continuing activities before financing costs and taxation.

**Taxation**
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently
payable and deferred tax.

Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the
year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported
in the income statement because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax
determination is uncertain but it is considered probable that
there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. The
provisions are measured at best estimate of the amount
expected to become payable. The assessment is based on
the judgement of tax professionals within the Company
supported by previous experience in respect of such
activities and in certain cases based on specialist
independent tax advice.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for
temporary differences between the carrying amount and
tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
differences and it is probable that the differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income
statement, except when it relates to items charged or
credited directly to other comprehensive income, in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other
comprehensive income.


The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets
reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of
its assets and liabilities.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred
income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable
entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention
to settle the balances on a net basis.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a
lease, at inception of the contract. The lease term is
determined from the commencement date of the contract
and covers the non-cancellable term. If considered
reasonably certain, extension or termination options are
included in the lease term.

At the commencement date, a lease liability is recognised,
measured at the present value of the future lease payments
and discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing
rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted by
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the
lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying
amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.

At the commencement date, a right of use asset is
recognised, measured at an amount equal to the lease
liability plus any lease payments made before the
commencement date and any initial direct costs, less any
lease incentive payments. An estimate of costs to be
incurred in restoring an asset, in accordance with the terms
of the lease, is also included in the right of use asset at initial
recognition. Subsequently, right of use assets are measured
in accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant
and equipment and are depreciated over the shorter period
of lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. Any
adjustments to the corresponding lease liability are reflected
in the corresponding right of use asset.

Short-term leases and low value leases are not recognised
as lease liabilities and right of use assets, but are
recognised as an expense straight-line over the lease term.

**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment
loss. Cost comprises original purchase price and the costs
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for
its intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised
finance costs.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the cost of
assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using
the straight-line method, on the following bases:

Freehold buildings **• 50 years**
Leasehold land and buildings **• the lesser of 50 years and**

the period of the lease
Plant and equipment **• between 3 and 20 years**


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2022


**2** **Significant accounting policies continued**

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less
any recognised impairment loss. Finance costs directly
attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying
assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets
are ready for their intended use.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,
with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on
a prospective basis.

**Acquired intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are
initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date,
which is regarded as their cost. Where necessary the fair
value of assets at acquisition and their estimated useful
lives are based on independent valuation reports.

Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis
over estimated useful lives, on the following bases:

Customer relationships **• between 5 and 20 years**
Other intangibles **• up to 20 years**

Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.

Acquired intangible assets are derecognised upon reaching
the end of their useful lives.

**Other intangible assets**
Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a
business combination are initially measured at cost and
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives of up to ten years.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from
development (or from the development phase of an internal
project) is recognised only if all of the following conditions
have been demonstrated:

**• the technical feasibility of completing the asset;**

**• the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or**
sell it;

**• the ability to use or sell the asset once development has**
been completed;

**• the probability that the asset created will generate future**
economic benefits;

**• the availability of adequate technical, financial and other**

resources to complete the development; and

**• the asset created can be separately identified and the**

development cost can be measured reliably.

The amount initially recognised for internally generated
intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred
from the date when the intangible asset first meets the
recognition criteria listed above. Where no internallygenerated intangible asset can be recognised, development
expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in
which it is incurred. The significant other intangible asset
in the Group relates to the Pathway Programme systems
transformation project.


**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and**
**intangible assets excluding goodwill**
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying
amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where
the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount
to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

**Inventories**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made
for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where they exist.

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument.

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the
following categories:

**• financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost (AC);**

**• financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit**

and loss (FVTPL); and

**• financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other**

comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair
value including, where permitted, any directly attributable
transaction costs.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured
in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value,
depending on their classification.


-----

Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash
and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Cash
and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts
with no access restrictions, and bank term deposits repayable
on demand or maturing within three months of inception.

At each reporting date the Group recognises a loss allowance
for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at
amortised cost. In establishing the appropriate amount of
loss allowance to be recognised, the Group applies either the
general approach or the simplified approach, depending on
the nature of the underlying class of financial assets:

**• Under the general approach, the Group recognises a loss**
allowance for a financial asset at an amount equal to the
12-month expected credit losses, unless the credit risk on
the financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition, in which case a loss allowance is recognised
at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.

**• The simplified approach is applied to the impairment**

assessment of trade and other receivables. Under this
approach, the Group recognises expected lifetime losses
upon initial recognition.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include
trade and other payables, lease liabilities and borrowings.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost unless they
form part of a fair value hedge relationship. The difference
between the initial carrying amount of borrowings and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement
over the contractual terms using the effective interest
rate method.

Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
through profit or loss when they do not meet the criteria to
be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through
other comprehensive income.

Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL are measured at
fair value at the end of each reporting period with fair value
gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they
are not part of a designated hedging relationship (see below).

**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial
instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and
foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange
forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency
options. Further details of derivative financial instruments
are set out in note 22.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date
the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting
period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement immediately unless the derivative is designated
and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the
timing of the recognition in the income statement depends
on the nature of the hedge relationship.

Hedge accounting
To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Group
designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in fair
value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net
investments in foreign operations as appropriate


At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument
and the hedged item, along with its risk management
objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on
an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair value or
cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group elected to continue to
apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 as
permitted by the standard.

Fair value hedges
The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for
foreign currency risk.

The fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is
recognised in the income statement and is recognised in
the same line as the hedged item.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging
reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the
hedged item from inception of the hedge.

Gains or losses relating to an ineffective portion are
recognised immediately in the income statement.

Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in equity are reclassified in the
income statement in the periods when the hedged item
affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised
hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast
transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial
asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses
previously recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in equity are removed from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the
non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes
the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. Any gain or loss accumulated at that
time in equity is recognised when the forecast transaction
is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain
or loss in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**Hedges of net investment in foreign operations**
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are
accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or
loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective
portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive
income in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the
effective portion of the hedge accumulated in the foreign
currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss
on the disposal of the foreign operation.

**2** **Significant accounting policies continued**

**Retirement benefit costs**
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered
service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are treated as
payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising
in a defined contribution scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits
is calculated using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations carried out at the end of each
reporting period.

Defined benefit costs are split into three categories, namely:

**• service costs, which includes current service cost, past service**
cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;

**• net interest expense; and**

**• remeasurements.**

The Group presents service costs within cost of sales and
administrative expenses.

Past service cost is recognised when the plan amendment
or curtailment occurs.

Net interest expense is recognised within finance costs and
is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined
benefit liability.

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and
the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are
recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge
or credit to the statement of other comprehensive income in
the period in which they occur and are not subsequently
reclassified to profit and loss.

**Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to
present value where the effect is material.

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the
Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that
has been communicated to affected parties.

**Share-based payments**
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. These are measured at the fair value of
the equity instruments at grant date. The fair value excludes
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The fair
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of
equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect
of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in
profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the
revised estimate with a corresponding adjustment to equity


reserves. The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion,
settle these share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is
recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured
initially at the fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet
date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement,
the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes
in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

**Alternative Performance Measures**
The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative
Performance Measures (APMs) since its adoption of IFRS
in 2005:

**• Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items**
from IFRS profit measures; and

**• EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and**
depreciation from IFRS operating profit.

The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides
additional clarity for the Group’s investors and so it is the
primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. It is not
intended to be a superior measure to IFRS; however, these
measures are used internally to manage the business.
Further information and the reconciliation to the IFRS
measures are included in notes 4 and 5.

**Critical accounting judgements and estimates**
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the
Directors are required to make judgements (other than
those involving estimations) that have a significant impact
on the amounts recognised and to make estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are considered to
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods
if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that
may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year are discussed below. The assumptions for
each estimate are set out in the relevant note referenced below.

**• Defined benefit obligation (note 26): Calculation of the Group’s**

defined benefit obligation includes a number of assumptions
which affect the carrying value of the obligation.

**• Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and property plant**
and equipment on acquisition: In a business combination,
intangible and tangible assets are identified and recognised
at fair value. The assumptions involved in valuing these
assets require the use of estimates that may differ from the
actual outcome. These estimates cover future growth
rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used.
Changing the assumptions selected by management could
significantly affect the allocation of the purchase price paid
between goodwill and other acquired intangibles.


-----

**• Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets: as part of**
impairment testing, the Group is required to estimate the
recoverable amount of cash generating units by
estimating future cash flows. The assumptions involved
in estimating the recoverable amount include future
growth rates and the discount rates used. Changing the
assumptions selected by management could significantly
affect the amount of any impairment.

**• Current tax liability and deferred tax (notes 10 and 11):**

The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income
taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world
and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based
on management’s interpretations of applicable laws,
regulations and relevant court decisions.

**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s**
**accounting policies**
In December 2022 the Group entered into agreements under
which amounts receivable from customers can be sold to a
third party on a non-recourse basis. These receivables are
derecognised at the point of sale which is shortly after the
initial recognition of the receivable balance. This derecognition
generated a net cash inflow of £82 million in the year ended
31 December 2022, reflected as a net reduction in receivables.
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group has determined that
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships of these
receivables have been transferred to the third parties under the
facilities, resulting in derecognition of the customer receivables.
IFRS 7 provides further guidance on disclosure requirements
where there is continued involvement in the derecognised
financial assets. The Group has determined that an asset should
be recognised in respect of deferred purchase price reserve,
which represents a portion of the original receivable. This reserve
is subsequently paid by the counterparties to the agreements,
whether the customer pays the receivable in full or not. Further
disclosures in relation to this receivable can be found in note 22.

There are no other critical judgements, apart from those
involving estimations (which are discussed above), that the
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s
accounting policies.

During 2018, the European Commission (the Commission)
initiated an investigation into practices relating to the
purchase of styrene monomer by companies, including
Synthomer, operating in the European Economic Area. The
Company has fully cooperated with the Commission during
its investigation, which concluded in 2022 resulting in a fine
of £38.5 million payable in 2023. In prior years given the
ongoing investigation and the inherent uncertainties
associated with it, it was not possible to determine whether
or not a liability existed. Similarly, given the many variables
in the Commission’s fining framework and accordingly the
range of possible outcomes, the Directors were not able to
reliably estimate any potential possible liability. Therefore
a contingent liability was initially disclosed in each set of
financial statements, before further information allowed
a provision of £57.2 million to be recognised in 2021.
No critical judgement or uncertainty remains now that
the investigation is concluded.


**3** **Adoption of new and revised standards**

There were no new standards or amendments to existing
standards that were effective in the year that have had a
material impact on the Group. There are a number of
amendments and clarifications to IFRS, effective in future
years, which have not been early adopted by the Group.
These standards, amendments or clarifications are not
expected to significantly affect the Group’s consolidated
results or financial position in the current or future periods.

**4** **Special items**

**IFRS and Underlying performance**
The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group
as a whole and as such include all sources of income and
expense, including both one-off items and those that do not
relate to the Group’s ongoing businesses. To provide additional
clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s
businesses, management uses ‘Underlying’ performance as an
Alternative Performance Measure to plan for, control and assess
the performance of the segments. Underlying performance
differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items.

**Special Items**
Special Items are disclosed separately in order to provide a
clearer indication of the Group’s Underlying performance.

Special Items are either irregular, and therefore including them
in the assessment of a segment’s performance would lead to
a distortion of trends, or are technical adjustments which
ensure the Group’s financial statements are in compliance
with IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of a
segment in the year, or both. An example of the latter is the
amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally relates
to acquired customer relationships. The Group incurs costs,
which are recognised as an expense in the income statement,
in maintaining these customer relationships. The Group
considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on
acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the
potential double counting of such costs and therefore
excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The following are consistently disclosed separately as
Special Items in order to provide a clearer indication of the
Group’s Underlying performance:

**• Restructuring and site closure costs;**

**• Sale of business or significant asset;**

**• Acquisition costs;**

**• Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;**

**• Impairment of non-current assets;**

**• Fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial**

instruments where hedge accounting is not applied;

**• Items of income and expense that are considered**
material, either by their size and/or nature;

**• Tax impact of above items; and**

**• Settlement of prior period tax issues.**

**Total impact on profit for the year** **(129.9)** (115.6)

Amortisation of acquired intangibles increased in 2022, reflecting the amortisation on the customer lists, patents, trademarks
and trade secrets arising on the acquisition of Eastman’s Adhesive Resins business. The fair value of the intangible assets
arising on the acquisition, amounting to £273.2 million, are being amortised over a period of 8-20 years mainly dependent on
the characteristics of the customer relationships.
Restructuring and site closure costs in 2022 comprise:

**• A £9.6 million charge in relation to the ongoing integration of the acquired business into the newly formed Adhesive**

Technologies division;

**• A £3.2 million charge in relation to site closure of one of the smaller sites in Malaysia;**

**• A further £6.7 million, in relation to further demolition and site rationalisation costs, as well as costs in relation to the strategy**

change and alignment of the business into its new divisions effective in 2023.
Restructuring and site closure costs in 2021 comprised £13.2 million of OMNOVA integration costs following its acquisition in
2020, an £11.6 million charge to demolish and rationalise assets at a small number of sites to bring them into line with our ESG
strategy, and a further £4.9 million to complete the rationalisation of the Group’s European Performance Materials network.
Acquisition costs and related gains are for the acquisition of Eastman’s Adhesive Resins business and comprise £11.9 million of
costs, mainly professional adviser fees, offset by a £5.4 million gain on a foreign exchange derivative entered into in October 2021
to hedge the acquisition price. Acquisition costs in 2021 also related to the acquisition of Eastman’s Adhesive Resins business.
Sale of business mainly related to the costs, primarily professional fees, incurred in conjunction with the sale of the Laminates,
Films and Coated Fabrics business to Surteco. In the prior year the sale of business principally comprised a further £7.1 million
loss on the onerous contract for the disposal of Synthomer’s European Tyre Cord business in 2020.
During 2018, the European Commission initiated an investigation into styrene monomer purchasing practices of a number of companies,
including Synthomer, operating in the European Economic Area. The Company has fully cooperated with the Commission throughout
the investigation. In 2021, based on the information available and the resulting assessment of the expected outcome of the investigation,
a provision of £57.2 million was made. In 2022, the Commission concluded its investigation, resulting in a fine of £38.5 million.
In July 2018 the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix euro interest rates on the full value of the then €440 million
committed unsecured revolving credit facility. The fair value movement of the unhedged interest rate derivatives relates to the
movement in the mark-to-market of the swap in excess of the Group’s current borrowings.
A £133.7 million impairment charge was taken in the year, relating to the Adhesives Technologies division. This was caused by
reliability and supply chain issues, demand weakness in key adhesives markets and lower than expected delivered capacity.
Taxation Special Items related to historical tax issues in Malaysia.
Taxation on Special Items is mainly deferred tax credits arising on the amortisation of acquired intangibles and restructuring
and site closure costs

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected
to benefit from that business combination.

In March 2021, a £2.1 million measurement period adjustment was recognised, relating to the acquisition of OMNOVA Solutions Inc.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. These assumptions have been updated in the year in light of the
current economic environment.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the Group. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted where
appropriate for the risk premium attributable to a particular CGU’s activities. A pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% (2021: 10.2%) has
been used in the above calculations for each of Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities, and
a pre-tax discount rate of 12.3% was used for Adhesive Technologies.

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for each CGU, derived from the most recent five-year business plans approved by the
Board. The final year cash flow is then assumed to apply into perpetuity with estimated annual growth rates of 3.1%, 1.9%, 2.0%
and 2.0% for Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions, Industrial Specialities and Adhesive Technologies respectively
(2021: 3.1%, 1.9% and 2.0% for Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industrial Specialities respectively) These
rates do not exceed average long-term growth rates for relevant markets.

A £133.7 million impairment charge was taken in the year, relating to the Adhesives Technologies division. This reflected
reliability and supply chain issues, which the Group is working to resolve, and lower-than-expected capacity acquired.

For all the CGUs, a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on these impairment tests, with scenarios covering increased cost
of capital, lower perpetuity growth rates, the impact of potential carbon taxes, reduced margins and reduction in customer
demand. For each CGU except for Adhesive Technologies, the Directors believe that there is no reasonably possible change in
the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based that would cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU. For Adhesive Technologies, the primary sensitivities identified were the discount
rate and the perpetuity growth rate. Every 0.25% decrease in perpetuity growth rate yields a decrease of c.£9 million in
recoverable amount. Every 0.1% increase in discount rate yields a decrease in recoverable amount of c.£5 million.

The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for trade receivables classified at amortised cost,
using the lifetime expected loss provision. The expected credit loss on trade receivables is estimated using a provision matrix
by reference to past default experience and credit rating, adjusted as appropriate for current observable data. The Group has no
significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. The following table details the
risk profile of trade receivables based on the Group’s provision matrix.

Note

The fair value of the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2022 was £1,266.8 million (31 December 2021: £629.4 million).

As at 31 December 2022 £9.4 million (2021: nil) of the interest rate swap derivative asset was designated as being in a
hedging relationship.

**Financial risk management**
The Group’s policies, approved by the Board, provide written principles on financial risk management and the use of financial derivatives.

These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has a policy of hedging significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at operating company level. The Group
regularly reviews its net assets and borrowing currency exposures, borrowing in overseas currencies in order to hedge the net
assets held in those currencies as appropriate. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including
derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

**Currency risk**

The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many currencies. As a result, it is
subject to foreign currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the Group’s transactions and the translation
of the results and underlying net assets of its operations.

To manage the currency risk the Group uses foreign currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge
overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros, US dollars and Malaysian ringgits. Profit translation
exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no
material currency exposures to disclose (2021: none)


-----

**22 Financial instruments continued**

**Interest rate risk**
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar and euro interest rates. To manage
interest rate risk, the Group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings, and utilises interest rate swaps. These
practices aim to minimise the Group’s net finance charges with acceptable year-on-year volatility.

At 31 December 2022 the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on €440 million of borrowings.

The Group’s interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movement on the hedged portion
recognised in equity. Interest paid on these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, within Underlying interest costs.
Fair value movement in the unhedged portion is also recognised in profit and loss, as a Special Item.

After taking account of interest rate swaps, the Group’s currency and interest rate exposure as at 31 December 2022 was:

**2022** 2021

**Floating rate** **Fixed rate** **Total** Floating rate Fixed rate Total
**borrowings** **borrowings** **borrowings** borrowings borrowings borrowings

**Total** **664.8** **602.0** **1,266.8** 192.1 437.3 629.4

**Market risk sensitivity analysis**
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Group uses a
sensitivity analysis that estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of
either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1.0% in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling
against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 with all other variables
remaining constant. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post-employment benefit liabilities
and assets, and corporate tax payable. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as interest and foreign exchange rates
rarely change in isolation.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.

Malaysian Ringgit exchange rate -/+ 10% **1.8** **1.8** **–** 0.5 0.5 –

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

For interest rate derivatives the mark-to-market adjustment, and amount recognised in equity as part of a hedging
arrangement, is estimated using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as
well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the
functional currency of the lender or borrower.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2022

**22 Financial instruments continued**

**Credit risk**
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Credit risk arises on cash balances, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date as disclosed
at the start of this note. A financial asset is in default when the counterparty fails to pay its contractual obligations. Financial
assets are written-off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Credit risk is managed separately for financial and
business-related credit exposures.

**Financial credit risk**
Synthomer aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and
monitored by the Board. Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and financial institutions with a credit rating
of investment grade and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits. The Group’s policy is
designed to ensure that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit
risk. The Board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted. Synthomer annually reviews the credit
limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties’ credit quality, reflecting market credit conditions.

**Business related credit risk**
Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and active risk management
is applied, focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and monitoring procedures. There is no significant
concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables as the Group has a large number of customers which are internationally
dispersed. See note 20 for information on credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables.

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that Synthomer is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, or that it is unable, on an ongoing
basis, to borrow funds at an acceptable price to fund actual or proposed commitments. The Group manages liquidity risk by
maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.

The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted contractual cash flows including interest payable for
the Group’s financial liabilities and derivative instruments. The liquidity analysis for lease liabilities is included in note 23. Where
interest payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated
based on the forward yield curve prevailing at the respective year ends. Derivative contracts are presented on a net basis.

The financial covenant at 31 December 2022 for the RCF is that net debt must be less than 4.0 times EBITDA. At 31 December
2022 the actual covenant for the net debt was 3.7 times EBITDA.

Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Synthomer’s financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event
of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances,
lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain borrowings and the inability to access committed facilities. Synthomer was in full
compliance with its financial covenants in respect of its borrowings throughout each of the years presented.

At the year end, Synthomer had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows:

**Fair value measurement**
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.

As prescribed by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the inputs are as follows:

**• Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.**

**• Level 2 – not Level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly.**

**• Level 3 – not based on observable market data.**

Interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques
incorporate inputs such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which are used in a discounted cash flow calculation
incorporating the instrument’s term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to
the valuation are observable in active markets, all of the Group’s financial instruments are classified as Level 2 financial instruments.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps is estimated by discounting the
future contractual cash flows using forward exchange rates, interest rates and prices at the balance sheet date.

There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the current or prior year.

**Hedge relationships**
The Group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. Strengths of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument is analysed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result
of timing, cash flows or value except when the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned. The change
in the credit risk of the hedging instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the economic relationship.

The notional amounts, contractual maturities and rates of the hedging instruments designated in hedging relationships as of
31 December 2021 by the main risk categories are as follows:

**Hedged risk** **Notional amount** **Maturity** **Range of hedged rates**

**2022**
**Cash flow hedges**

Interest rate swap **Interest Rate** **Up to €440m** **28/08/2018 – 28/08/2025** **0.517% to 0.535% Fixed**

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

31 December 2022

**22 Financial instruments continued**

Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.

The ratio for hedging instruments designated in both net investment and cash flow hedge relationships was 1:1. Ineffectiveness
could occur on either hedging relationship due to significant changes in counterparty credit risk or a reduction in the notional
amount of the hedged item during the designated hedging period.

Cash flow hedges
The Group designated as a cash flow hedge the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on its euro borrowings.

In 2022 a gain of £9.7 million (2021: £3.4 million gain) was recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in respect of these
derivatives. At 31 December 2022 the cash flow hedge reserve includes a cumulative loss of £0.3 million (2021: loss of
£10.0 million), all of which relates to continuing cash flow hedges. The cash flows are expected to occur between 2023 and 2025.

In the year, the Group’s euro borrowings remained below the total of the interest rate derivative contracts, leading to a balance not able
to be designated as a cash flow hedge. The change in fair value relating to the unhedged portion of the interest rate swaps was a gain
of £25.1 million (2021: gain of £6.2 million) which was recognised in the income statement within finance costs as a Special Item.

**Receivables financing**
In December 2022 the Group entered into agreements under which amounts receivable from customers can be sold to a third
party on a non-recourse basis. As a result, £100.3 million of trade receivables were sold and derecognised in December 2022.
A corresponding asset of £17.6 million has been recognised in respect of deferred purchase price reserves, which represent a
portion of the original receivables. This balance has been recorded within “other receivables” in note 20. These reserves are
subsequently paid by the counterparties to the agreements, whether the customer pays the receivable in full or not. The fair
value of these assets is considered to be the same as the carrying value. Movements in receivables balances as a result of
receivables financing are included in movement in working capital within note 28.

**Capital management**
The Board is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the business so as to deliver
continued improvement in the return from those investments and by managing the capital structure.

Synthomer manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency and to provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle
and give efficient access to debt markets at attractive cost levels. This is achieved by targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio between
1.0 and 2.0. In order to finance acquisitions, the Group may increase the ratio with a view to deleveraging in the medium term.

As at 31 December 2022 the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.7 times (2021: 0.3 times).

The Board maintains a dividend policy to 2.5 times earnings cover. Should excess capital not be deployed for acquisitions or
capital expenditure, the Board will periodically consider one-off capital returns to shareholders in order to maintain an efficient
balance sheet. In 2022 the Board announced the suspension of dividends until the end of 2023.


-----

**23 Leases**

The Group has a portfolio of leases mainly comprising land and buildings, chemical storage tanks and vehicles. Further details
are given in note 2.

Information in respect of right of use assets, including the carrying amount, additions and depreciation, are set out in note 17
to these financial statements. Information in respect of the carrying value is set out below and information in respect of interest
arising on lease liabilities is set out in note 9.

Synthomer also enters into short-term leases and low value leases which are not recognised as right of use assets and lease
liabilities. The expense recognised in the year in relation to these leases is not material. Synthomer has no material exposure to
variable lease payments, extension options or committed leases not yet commenced.

The total cash outflow for leases in the year was as follows:

**2022** 2021
**£m** £m

Payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities **10.1** 9.7

Payments for the interest portion of lease liabilities **1.4** 1.5

assets at a small number of sites. In the year, two new provisions were recognised on acquisition of the Adhesive Resins business from
Eastman. £9.9 million was recognised in relation to environmental remediation work required at the Jefferson and Middelburg sites, and a
further £9.9 million was recognised for the demolition and disposal of unused equipment and vacant tanks at the Jefferson and Longview
sites in order to bring them into line with our ESG strategy. During 2022, the European Commission concluded its investigation into styrene
monomer purchasing practices, and the final settlement amount of £38.5 million, to be paid in 2023, was transferred to other payables.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations**

The Group operates a variety of retirement benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.

**Defined contribution scheme**
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees. Costs recognised in respect of defined
contribution pension plans across the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 were £12.6 million (2021: £10.9 million).

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is re-insured with
an external insurance company.

**Multi-employer schemes**
The Group participates in several tariffs of the Pensionskasse Degussa in Germany, which is a multi-employer pension scheme.
Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing. The assets of all
participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience. Therefore
sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis and the
Group accounts for the scheme on a defined contribution basis. The Group expects to make a regular contribution of
£2.1 million to the scheme in 2023.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable based on an actuarial assessment
of each participating employer’s share of the future benefit accrual. At 31 December 2022 there is no indication of any
commitment for additional deficit contributions in excess of regular contributions.


-----

**26 Retirement benefit obligations continued**

**Defined benefit schemes**
UK
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the Company. The trustees of
the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The
trustees of the pension scheme are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009 and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined
contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. A triennial
actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken in 2021 and completed in 2022. The next triennial valuation is due in 2024.

USA
The Group’s US defined benefit scheme was acquired as part of the OMNOVA acquisition and is administered by a fund which
is legally separate from OMNOVA Solutions Inc. The fiduciary committee is required by law to act in the interest of the fund and
is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2011 and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined
contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned and a formal
valuation is undertaken on an annual basis.

Germany
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany. These schemes are closed to new members. In line
with common practice, these schemes are unfunded and liabilities are settled on a cash basis as they fall due. At each balance
sheet date, obligations are calculated by external actuaries.

Other
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and retirement benefit schemes. For the funded schemes, assets
are held separately from those of the Group. The aggregated pension disclosures for the other defined benefit schemes have
been compiled from a number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2022.

Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets
underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase
in the value of the plan assets in bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

Charges to the income statement in respect of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are as follows:

The Group remains committed to funding the UK and US defined benefit schemes.

Following the 2021 triennial valuation of the UK scheme, which completed in 2022, the Company committed to paying
contributions for the period to 31 March 2024.

The defined benefit obligation of the US scheme reduced to £10.6 million at 31 December 2022. The Group is expecting to
contribute $1 million in 2023, rising to $6 million in 2025.

The Group’s other defined benefit schemes are largely unfunded, with minimal plan assets. Liabilities from these schemes are
settled on a cash basis as they fall due.

**Actuarial assumptions**
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2022** 2021

**UK** **US** **Germany** **Other** UK US Germany Other

Rate of increase in pensions in payment **3.00%** **0.00%** **1.00%** **2.00% – 3.70%** 3.20% 0.00% 1.00% 2.00% – 3.40%

Rate of increase in pensions in deferment
(“salary increase” on AON Germany reports) **2.70%** **0.00%** **2.50%** **2.00% – 3.70%** 2.90% 0.00% 2.50% 2.00% – 3.40%

Discount rate **5.00%** **5.20%** **3.70%** **0.27% – 5.16%** 1.80% 2.66% 1.20% 0.27% – 2.48%

Inflation assumption **3.10%** **0.00%** **2.25%** **2.00% – 2.40%** 3.40% 0.00% 1.75% 1.20% – 2.00%

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. Mortality
assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and, where appropriate, include an allowance for future
improvements in life expectancy. In addition, where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken into account. The
Group’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and Germany where, using the mortality tables adopted, the
expected lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at age 65 in 20 years’ time is as follows:

**2022** 2021

**Retiring Today** **Retiring in 20 years** Retiring Today Retiring in 20 years

**UK** **US** **Germany** **UK** **US** **Germany** UK US Germany UK US Germany

Males **87.3** **86.4** **85.6** **88.9** **87.4** **88.4** 87.2 86.4 85.5 88.8 87.4 88.2

Females **89.5** **87.5** **89.0** **91.0** **88.5** **91.3** 89.5 87.5 88.9 90.9 88.5 91.1

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 11.0 years for the UK scheme
(2021: 14.9 years), 6.8 years for the US scheme (2021: 10.7 years) and 13.9 years for the German schemes (2021: 17.2 years).

**26 Retirement benefit obligations continued**

**Sensitivity Analysis**
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality. The
sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end
of the reporting period, assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:

**Increase/(decrease) in scheme liabilities**

**UK** **US** **Germany**
**£m** **£m** **£m**

Discount rate (decrease of 1%) **34** **13** **9**

Future mortality rate (one year increase in expectancy) **9** **4** **2**

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is
unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the
defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit
obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when
calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

**Cash flow hedging reserve**
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash
flow hedges. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss only when the
hedged transaction affects the profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent
with the applicable accounting policy.

**Translation reserve**
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries
only, from their functional currency into the parent’s functional currency, being sterling, are recognised directly in the translation
reserve. Gains and losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are
included in the translation reserve.

The goodwill arising on acquisition represented the premium the Group paid to acquire the Adhesive Resins business from
Eastman, to complement the existing businesses and to strengthen Synthomer’s presence in North America and Europe.

In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2022 the business contributed £391.3 million to the Group’s revenue,
£39.5 million to the Group’s EBITDA, £22.5 million to the Group’s Underlying operating profit and a loss of £146.8 million to the
Group’s IFRS operating profit. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year the business would
have contributed £510.9 million to the Group’s revenue, £60.0 million of the Group’s EBITDA, £38.8 million to the Group’s
Underlying operating profit and a loss of £135.0 million to the Group’s IFRS operating loss.

**31 Discontinued operations**

On 13 December 2022, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Laminates, Films and Coated
Fabrics businesses to Surteco North America, Inc. The UK Financial Conduct Authority approved the transaction on
16 December 2022. Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained on 11 January 2023 and the transaction completed on
28 February 2023 with net cash proceeds of $262 million.

The associated assets and liabilities were consequently presented for sale in the 2022 financial statements.

The Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics businesses all form part of the Industrial Specialities division.

Financial information in respect of the discontinued operation is set out below:

The prior-year figures of the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of cash flows have been restated

3,273,222

The total exercise price for all the above grants is £nil.

For options outstanding as at 31 December 2022, the exercise price was £nil and the weighted average remaining contractual
life was 5.24 years (2021: 4.95 years).

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £2.33 (2021: £4.64).

The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £2.37 (2021: £3.60). The
valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions, using a Monte Carlo simulation model:

**2022** 2021
**£m** £m

Weighted average share price (£) **3.64** 4.68

Option price (£) **–** –

Value of optionality **nil** nil

Vesting assumption **35%** 77%

The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and
is based on market conditions and management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
The charge in the year in relation to the equity-settled scheme was £0.7 million (2021: £2.1 million). The Group also operates a
cash-settled share-based payment scheme for which there was a credit in the year of £1.9 million (2021: charge of £1.8 million)
and for which there was a liability at the year end of £0.9 million (2021: £4.0 million).

# Independent auditors’ report

to the members of Synthomer plc

### Report on the audit of the financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Synthomer plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the

‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group’s loss and the Group’s cash
flows for the year then ended;

- The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with

UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

- The Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with

United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law); and

- The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the

Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report 2023 (the ‘Annual
Report’), which comprise: the Consolidated balance sheet and the Company statement of financial
position as at 31 December 2023; the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Company
statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the Reconciliation of
net cash flow from operating activities to movement in net debt for the year then ended; and the
notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs
(UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Independence**
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s
Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by
the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements we have


**Our audit approach**

**Overview**
Audit scope

- Audit procedures provide coverage of 82% of revenue and 79% of underlying operating profit.

- Audit scope covers 9 countries, performing procedures over 14 components.

- Financially significant component in the USA (Synthomer Adhesive Technologies LLC).

Key audit matters

- Impairment of goodwill (Group)

- Valuation of defined benefit pension obligations (Group)

- Presentation of Special Items (Group)

- Recoverability of investment in, and amounts owed by, Group undertakings (Company)

Materiality

- Overall Group materiality: £9,105,000 (2022: £11,743,000) based on approximately 5% of

three-year weighted average of underlying profit before taxation (2022: approximately 5%
of three-year weighted average of underlying profit before taxation).

- Overall Company materiality: £8,194,000 (2022: £10,568,000) based on 1% of total assets

capped at 90% of Group materiality.

- Performance materiality: £6,828,750 (2022: £8,807,000) (Group) and £6,145,000 (2022:

£7,926,000) (Company).

**The scope of our audit**
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material
misstatement in the financial statements.

**Key audit matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud)
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the
engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our
procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on
these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Fair value accounting associated with the Adhesive Technologies acquisition, which was a
key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of there being no acquisitions
during the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Otherwise, the key audit matters below
are consistent with last year.


-----

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


**Impairment of goodwill (Group)**

As set out in note 14, the Group had goodwill of £465.7m
(2022: £480.8m) at 31 December 2023, after an impairment
of £nil (2022: £133.7m). This is significant in the context of the
overall balance sheet of the Group. We consider this to be a key
audit matter because the estimates underlying the recoverability
of goodwill are subject to high estimation uncertainty, particularly
in a year where the Group’s performance has significantly
deteriorated. Management’s assessment of the “value in use” of
the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) involves judgements
about the future results of the businesses, particularly
assumptions around growth rates and the weighted average cost
of capital applied to future cash flow forecasts, where there is a
higher degree of sensitivity.

**Valuation of defined benefit pension obligations (Group)**

As set out in note 26, the Group had £64.7m (2022: £73.4m) net
liabilities as at 31 December 2023 in relation to defined benefit
pension schemes. This primarily represents the Yule Catto group
retirement benefits scheme in the UK with defined benefit
obligation of £269.6m (2022: of £268.9m), the OMNOVA
Solutions Consolidated Pension Plan in the USA with defined
benefit obligation of £166.5m (2022: £175.9m) and an unfunded
scheme in Germany with defined benefit obligation of £63.0m
(2022: £60.8m). The Group uses third-party actuaries to calculate
pension obligations. The valuation of these obligations is based
on a number of assumptions, and the calculation is highly
sensitive to small changes in the assumptions. For instance,
changes in inflation, mortality tables and discount rates can have
a significant impact on the valuation of the obligation recorded.


Procedures performed included:

- Understanding business processes and controls related to the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill

for impairment.

- Assessing the reasonableness of the impairment model and understanding management’s process and judgements

utilised for developing estimates and assumptions. This included testing of the underlying “value-in-use” calculations.

- Agreeing the inputs in management’s impairment model to board approved plans.

- Performing a retrospective review of the previous period estimates by comparing this to actual results in the

current period.

- Engaging our internal valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital

and growth rate assumptions used by management.

- Assessing corroborating or contradictory evidence relating to significant assumptions in the cash flow projections.

- Performing sensitivity analyses based on reasonably possible outcomes.

- Checking the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.

- Assessing the effect of climate change included in management’s cash flow forecast.

- Reviewing the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the carrying value of goodwill.

Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that no impairment was required. We also consider the
disclosures in the financial statements to be appropriate.

In order to assess the identified risks:

- We reviewed external actuarial reports of the UK and German schemes which set out the calculations and

assumptions underpinning the year-end pension scheme obligations valuation and our USA component team
reviewed an external actuarial report for the USA scheme.

- We (and PwC US) held discussions with the external actuaries and were satisfied that the scope of their work

was such that we could use this work to provide evidence for the purpose of our audit.

- We assessed the competency and objectivity of the external actuaries to perform the year-end calculations by

considering their technical expertise and independence from the Group.

- We used our own specialist actuarial team to evaluate the key assumptions used in each of the three schemes

by comparing these assumptions to our expectations for similar schemes as at the year end.

- We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures within the financial statements.

Based on the outcome of our procedures as set out above, we have concluded that the pension assumptions
are within a reasonable range and that the defined benefit obligations are appropriately valued as of the
31 December 2023 year end.

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**


**Presentation of special items (Group)**

The Group presents two measures of performance in the income
statement; statutory and underlying, the latter after adjusting for
certain items of income or expenses (‘Special Items’), as
management believes these measures provide additional useful
information on the underlying trends, performance and position
of the Group. The determination of which items of income or
expense are classified as Special Items is subject to judgement,
and therefore users of the financial statements could be misled if
amounts are not classified or calculated appropriately.
Description of the amounts presented as Special Items are
included in note 4 to the financial statements.

**Recoverability of investment in, and amounts owed by,**
**Group undertakings (Company)**

As disclosed in notes 3 and 6 of the Company’s financial
statements, the Company held an investment in subsidiaries
of £737.2m (2022: £733.1m) and amounts owed by Group
undertakings of £1,991.1m (2022: £1,987.3m) at 31 December
2023. The assessment of the recoverability of these assets
required the application of management judgement, particularly
in determining whether any impairment indicators have arisen
that trigger the need for a formal impairment assessment and in
assessing whether the carrying value of each investment and
amounts owed by Group undertakings are recoverable. As
changes to these judgements and estimates could have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements, we
consider this to be a key audit matter.


We considered the appropriateness of amounts classified as Special Items. To do this we considered:

- The Group’s accounting policy on Special Items and pronouncements by the Financial Reporting Council on

this matter.

- We assessed the income and expenses classified as Special Items against the Group’s accounting policies.

- We challenged management on the appropriateness of the classification of such Special Items, being mindful that

classification should be even-handed between gains and losses, the basis of the classification should be clearly
disclosed and a clear reconciliation to statutory measures provided and applied consistently one year to the next.

- We challenged management on the quantum of the Special Items, and the estimates underpinning a number of

these items.

Having considered the nature and quantum of these items, overall we are satisfied that the presentation of
Special Items in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 is materially appropriate and
consistent with the previous years.

Our procedures included the following:

- Assessing the recoverable value with reference to the net assets of the underlying subsidiaries and amounts

owed by Group undertakings with reference to the Director’s intentions for the settlement of Group-wide
intercompany balances.

- Verifying that the recoverable values of the investment was consistent with the recoverable value of the CGUs

tested for goodwill impairment purposes, leveraging the audit work undertaken as part of the Group audit.

Based on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues from our work.


**How we tailored the audit scope**
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to
give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of
the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in
which they operate.

As set out in note 5 ‘Segmental analysis’, the Group reports its results as three segments:
Coatings & Construction Solutions, Adhesive Solutions; and Health & Protection and
Performance Materials. The Group’s financial statements are a consolidation of reporting
units, being holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating companies,
across 24 countries. Two countries, being the USA and Germany, account for a significant
portion of the Group’s results. We accordingly focused our work on four (one of which is
financially significant) of the reporting units in these countries, which were subject to audits
of their complete financial information In addition to increase our coverage of the Group’s


revenue and underlying profit before tax, we performed full scope audit procedures on an
additional 10 reporting units located in the UK, Italy, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Austria,
France and the Netherlands. These components accounted for 82% of the Group’s revenue
and 79% of the Group’s underlying operating profit.

Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement
we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the
Group’s financial statements as a whole. During the audit, senior members of the Group
team held a number of meetings with all the component teams and reviewed the work
performed by these teams over those areas of higher audit risk. The Group audit partner also
visited the USA and the Netherlands as part of the audit planning and completion processes.


-----

At the Group level, we also carried out analytical procedures on selected components not
covered by the procedures described above. The Group engagement team also performed
audit procedures over the consolidation process.

Synthomer plc (the ‘Company’) was in full scope and the audit procedures over the Company’s
transactions and balances were performed by the Group audit team. The Company’s material
financial statement line items which were in scope for the Group audit are other intangible
assets, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other payables. The Company is also
audited on a standalone basis, and hence testing has been performed on all material
financial statement line items included in the Company standalone financial statements.

**The impact of climate risk on our audit**
As part of our audit, we made enquiries of management to understand the process
management has adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the
Group’s financial statements and support the disclosures made within the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report. In addition to enquiries with
management, we also read the governance processes in place to assess climate risk. We
challenged the completeness of management’s climate risk assessment by reading the
Group’s website/communications for details of climate-related impacts. Management have
made commitments to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and with Vision 2030
they are working on their pathway towards this. Management considers the impact of climate
risk does not give rise to a potential material financial statement impact. Using our knowledge
of the business, we evaluated management’s risk assessment and its estimates as set out in
note 2 of the financial statements and resulting disclosures where significant. We considered
impairment of non-current assets, especially impairment of goodwill and intangible assets,
as the area to potentially be materially affected by climate risk, and consequently we focused
our audit work in this area. To respond to the audit risks identified in this area, we tailored our
audit approach to address these. In particular, we challenged management on how the
impact of climate commitments made by the Group would affect the assumptions within the
discounted cash flows prepared by management that are used in the Group’s impairment
analysis. We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change
(including the disclosures in the TCFD section) within the Annual Report with the financial
statements and our knowledge obtained from our audit. Our procedures did not identify any
material impact in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, or our key
audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2023.

**Materiality**
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain
quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations,
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our
audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial
statements as a whole.


Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial
statements as a whole as follows:

**Financial statements – Group** **Financial statements – Company**


For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less
than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components
was between £700,000 to £6,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that
the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.
Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the
nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures,
for example, in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%)
of overall materiality, amounting to £6,828,750 (2022: £8,807,000) for the Group financial
statements and £6,145,000 (2022: £7,926,000) for the Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history
of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk, and the effectiveness of controls
– and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified
during our audit above £455,000 (Group audit) (2022: £587,000) and £409,000 (Company
audit) (2022: £528,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view,
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.


Overall materiality £9,105,000
(2022: £11,743,000).


How we
determined it

Rationale for
benchmark applied


Approximately 5% of three-year
weighted average of underlying
profit before taxation (2022:
approximately 5% of three-year
weighted average of underlying
profit before taxation).

We believe that underlying
profit before taxation, being
profit before tax adjusted for
Special Items, is a key metric
for investors and is used by the
Board in measuring the Group’s
financial performance.


£8,194,000
(2022: £10,568,000).

1% of total assets capped at
90% of Group materiality.

We believe that total assets is
the primary measure used by
the shareholders in assessing
the performance of the
Company, and is a generally
accepted benchmark. The
value is capped for the purpose
of the Group audit with
reference to Group materiality.

Independent auditors report to the
members of Synthomer plc continued

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- We reviewed the Directors’ going concern paper and model supporting their going

concern assumption. We discussed with management the assumptions applied in the
going concern review so we could understand and challenge the rationale for those
assumptions, using our knowledge of the business. We tested the model’s mathematical
accuracy and considered the reasonableness of the revenue and cost assumptions
made, and the available headroom throughout a period of at least 12 months from the
date of approval of the financial statements;

- We reviewed management’s sensitivity scenarios including their severe but plausible

downside. We considered potential mitigating actions available to the Group that are
achievable and within management’s control. We then assessed the availability of liquid
resources under the different scenarios prepared by management and the associated
covenant tests applicable;

- We also assessed additional downside sensitivities and considered the impact on

covenants and liquidity headroom; and

- We reviewed the Group’s post year end performance, including the January 2024 CFO

report, and noted that the Group’s performance in January 2024 was significantly ahead
of budget.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties
relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt
on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not
a guarantee as to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the Directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate
Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the
Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern
are described in the relevant sections of this report.


**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the
financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude
whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we also considered whether the
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires
us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors’ report**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information
given in the Strategic report and Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is
consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with
applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company, and their
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material
misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors’ report.

**Directors’ remuneration**
In our opinion, the part of the annual report on remuneration to be audited has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.


-----

**Corporate governance statement**

The Listing Rules require us to review the Directors’ statements in relation to going concern,
longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified
for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance
statement and other information are described in the Reporting on other information
section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the
following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within the Governance
report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained
during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- The Directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the

emerging and principal risks;

- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures

are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being
managed or mitigated;

- The Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it

appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the
financial statements;

- The Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group’s and Company’s

prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and

- The Directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the

Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over
the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any
necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the Directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and
Company was substantially less in scope than an audit, and only consisted of making
enquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that
the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance
Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements
and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each
of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent
with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- The Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair,

balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to
assess the Group’s and Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy;

- The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk

management and internal control systems; and

- The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.


We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the Directors’
statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review
by the auditors.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements**
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The
Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our
procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of
non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of environmental, health and
safety and competition regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance
might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and
regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act
2006, the Listing Rules, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and legislations applicable
to material component teams. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for
fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls),
and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to
increase revenue and management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement
team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work.


-----

Independent auditors report to the
members of Synthomer plc continued

Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component
auditors included:

- Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or

suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud. This
included review of Board minutes, internal audit reports and the report from the
whistleblowing hotline;

- Evaluation of management’s controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;

- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant

accounting estimates, in particular in relation to impairment of goodwill, going concern
and viability, and the valuation of defined benefit scheme liabilities; and

- Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular, any journal entries posted with

unusual account combinations (for example, credit to revenue with a debit entry to an
unexpected account).

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to
become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not
closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk
of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example,
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and
balances, possibly using data-auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a
limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often
seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other
cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population
from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is
located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description
forms part of our auditors’ report.

**Use of this report**
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our previous consent in
writing.


### Other required reporting

**Companies Act 2006 exception reporting**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- We have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate

for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- The Company financial statements and the part of the annual report on remuneration to

be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Appointment**

Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the
members on 12 July 2012 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2012 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 12
years, covering the years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2023.

### Other matter

As required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule
4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the ESEF-prepared annual financial report
filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance
with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (‘ESEF RTS’). This auditors’ report provides
no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared using the single
electronic format specified in the ESEF RTS.

## Notes to the consolidated financial statements

for the year ended 31 December 2023


**1 General information**

Synthomer plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company limited by shares
and incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and registered in England
under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on page 203.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’)
and the nature of the Group’s operations are set out in the Strategic report.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling,
the functional currency of the Company. Foreign operations are included
in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.

**2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards
and the disclosure guidance and transparency rules sourcebook of the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under
the historical cost basis, except for defined benefit assets and the revaluation of
financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting
period, as explained in the accounting policies below.

The principal accounting policies adopted and applied in the preparation of these
financial statements consistently in all the years presented are set out below.

**Going concern**
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank
facilities. The current economic conditions continue to create uncertainty,
particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s products. The Group’s
forecasts and projections take account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance and a severe but plausible downside scenario has been prepared,
linked to our principal risks. Various mitigating actions have been identified so
that, should such a scenario crystallise, the Group could take action quickly to
significantly reduce costs and cash outflows as demonstrated during the course
of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.


The severe but plausible downside scenario, offset by mitigation actions as
required, does not threaten the Group’s ability to operate within the level of its
current facilities. Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters
discussed in connection with the viability statement (see page 60), the Directors
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in
preparing its consolidated financial statements. Further information on the
Group’s borrowings is given in note 21.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of
the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made
up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:

- Has the power over the investee

- Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement
with the Investee

- Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins from the date the Company obtains
control and ceases from the date the Company loses control. Where necessary
on obtaining control, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by
the Group.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s
equity therein. Subsequent to the date on which the Company obtains control, the
carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes
in equity.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash
flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are
eliminated on consolidation.


-----

**Business combinations**
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the
acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination
is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date
fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised
in profit or loss as incurred.

At acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are
recognised at their fair value, except that:

- Deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance
with IAS 12 Income Taxes

- Liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised
and measured in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits

- Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance
with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are
measured in accordance with that standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the
reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional
amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional
amounts are adjusted during a measurement period (see below), or additional
assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known,
would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

A measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the
Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.

If a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held
interest in the acquired entity is remeasured to its acquisition date fair value
and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.

**Goodwill**
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over
the Group’s interest in acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired less
liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash
generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
CGUs are defined as our reportable segments: Coatings & Construction Solutions,


CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount
of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested
for impairment at that date.

Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP before 1998 has not been
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss
on disposal.

**Joint ventures**
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under
the equity method, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and
adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits
or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

**Revenue**

General
Synthomer manufactures and sells mainly water-based polymers across
a diverse range of end-use applications. Our products are predominantly
sold in liquid form, in bulk containers.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects
to be entitled in a contract with a customer when performance obligations are
satisfied. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when control of the product
is transferred from Synthomer to the customer.

The customer is deemed to obtain control of the resultant asset in line with the
International Commercial Terms under which it is sold. The significant majority
of Synthomer’s products are sold under Carriage Paid To (CPT) and Carriage and
Insurance Paid (CIP) International Commercial Terms. Under these terms, control
of the product is transferred when the goods reach their destination. At this
point, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred and there is no
unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the product.
A receivable is recognised at this point in time as consideration is unconditional
and only the passage of time is required before payment is due.


-----

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2023

**2 Significant accounting policies continued**

Rebates
Synthomer may grant customers rebates if the goods purchased by the customer
exceed a contractually defined threshold within the specified period. Rebates are
usually deducted from the amounts payable by the customer. Depending on the
terms of the underlying contract, Synthomer uses either the expected value or
the most likely amount to estimate the variable consideration for expected future
rebates. Historical, current and forecast information is considered when
calculating rebates.

The majority of rebate programmes are aligned with the Group’s financial
year end, providing certainty around how much should be recognised in
the financial statements.

Other
The Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of
promised goods to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.
As a consequence, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does
not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.

**Foreign currencies**
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in
currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recognised at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical
cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they
arise except for:

   - Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign
currency risks (see below under ‘hedge accounting’)

   - Exchange differences on monetary items receivable or payable to a foreign
operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the
foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign
operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and
reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-sterling operations
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date Income and


expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. The Group elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterlingdenominated assets and liabilities.

**Operating profit and loss**
Operating profit and loss represents profit and loss from continuing activities
before financing costs and taxation.

**Taxation**
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit
differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is
uncertain but it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds
to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at best estimate of the amount
expected to become payable. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax
professionals within the Company supported by previous experience in respect of
such activities and in certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences
between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary differences and
it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future


-----

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or
credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred
tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax
consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects,
at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of
its assets and liabilities.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied
by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable
entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Global Minimum Top-up Tax
The Group has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules
(Amendments to IAS 12) upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments
provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the
top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about
the Pillar Two exposure (see Note 10).

The mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new
legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at
31 December 2022 in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related
deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no
impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**Leases**
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the
contract. The lease term is determined from the commencement date of the
contract and covers the non-cancellable term. If considered reasonably certain,
extension or termination options are included in the lease term.

At the commencement date, a lease liability is recognised, measured at the
present value of the future lease payments and discounted using the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted by
increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing
the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the li


At the commencement date, a right of use asset is recognised, measured at an
amount equal to the lease liability plus any lease payments made before the
commencement date and any initial direct costs, less any lease incentive
payments. An estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring an asset, in
accordance with the terms of the lease, is also included in the right of use
asset at initial recognition. Subsequently, right of use assets are measured in
accordance with the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment and
are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and the useful life of the
underlying asset. Any adjustments to the corresponding lease liability are
reflected in the corresponding right of use asset.

Short-term leases and low value leases are not recognised as lease liabilities
and right of use assets, but are recognised as an expense straight-line over the
lease term.

**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and any recognised impairment loss. Cost comprises original purchase price
and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its
intended use, including, where appropriate, capitalised finance costs.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their
residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the
following bases:

Freehold buildings - 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings - The lesser of 50 years and the

period of the lease
Plant and equipment - Between 3 and 20 years

Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised
impairment loss. Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those
assets. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready
for their intended use.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed
at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate
accounted for on a prospective basis.

**2 Significant accounting policies continued**

**Acquired intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised
at their fair value at the acquisition date, which is regarded as their cost. Where
necessary, the fair value of assets at acquisition and their estimated useful lives
are based on independent valuation reports.

Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line
basis over estimated useful lives, on the following bases:

Customer relationships   - Between 5 and 20 years
Other intangibles   - Up to 20 years

Assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation.

Acquired intangible assets are derecognised on reaching the end of their
useful lives.

**Other intangible assets**
Other intangible assets that are not acquired through a business combination
are initially measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives of up to 10 years.

An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the
development phase of an internal project) is recognised only if all of the following
conditions have been demonstrated:

   - The technical feasibility of completing the asset

   - The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it

   - The ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed

   - The probability that the asset created will generate future economic benefits

   - The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to
complete the development

   - The asset created can be separately identified and the development cost
can be measured reliably.

The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the
sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first
meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised
as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.


**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets**
**excluding goodwill**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of
the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its
recoverable amount to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised in previous years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in the income statement.

**Inventories**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads
that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made
for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where they exist.

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:

- Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost (AC)


-----

- Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)

- Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVTOCI).

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value including,
where permitted, any directly attributable transaction costs.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at
either amortised cost or fair value, depending on their classification.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash and cash equivalents
and trade and other receivables. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held
in bank accounts with no access restrictions, and bank term deposits repayable
on demand or maturing within three months of inception.

At each reporting date, the Group recognises a loss allowance for expected
credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost. In establishing the
appropriate amount of loss allowance to be recognised, the Group applies either
the general approach or the simplified approach, depending on the nature of the
underlying class of financial assets:

- Under the general approach, the Group recognises a loss allowance for
a financial asset at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses,
unless the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since
initial recognition, in which case a loss allowance is recognised at an amount
equal to the lifetime expected credit losses

- The simplified approach is applied to the impairment assessment of trade and
other receivables. Under this approach, the Group recognises expected lifetime
losses on initial recognition.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include trade and other payables,
lease liabilities and borrowings. Borrowings are measured at amortised cost
unless they form part of a fair value hedge relationship. The difference between
the initial carrying amount of borrowings and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the contractual terms using the effective interest
rate method.

Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss
when they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or at fair
value through other comprehensive income.

Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of
each reporting period with fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss
to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship (see below)


**Derivative financial instruments**
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage
its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign
exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are set out in note 22.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts
are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end
of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as
a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the
income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

Hedge accounting
To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Group designates certain
derivatives as hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges,
or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as appropriate.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group
documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes
in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

On adoption of IFRS 9, the Group elected to continue to apply the hedge
accounting requirements of IAS 39 as permitted by the standard.

Fair value hedges
The Group only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency risk.

The fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognised in the
income statement and is recognised in the same line as the hedged item.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income
and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve, limited to the
cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge.

Gains or losses relating to an ineffective portion are recognised immediately in
the income statement.


-----

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2023

**2 Significant accounting policies continued**

Cash flow hedges continued
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated
in equity are reclassified in the income statement in the periods when the hedged
item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of
a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost
of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship,
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss accumulated at that time in equity
is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or
loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**Hedges of net investment in foreign operations**
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly
to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the
effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income in
the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of
the hedge accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified
to profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation.

**Retirement benefit costs**
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an
expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are treated as
payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under
the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution scheme.

For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is calculated using the
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations carried out at the end of
each reporting period.

Defined benefit costs are split into three categories, namely:

   - Service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost and
gains and losses on curtailments and settlements

   - Net interest expense


The Group presents service costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses.

Past service cost is recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

Net interest expense is recognised within finance costs and is calculated by
applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.

Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme
assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with
a charge or credit to the statement of other comprehensive income in the period
in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.

**Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are
discounted to present value where the effect is material.

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed
formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.

**Share-based payments**
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date. The
fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The
impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit
or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with
a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. The Group will on occasion, at its
own discretion, settle these share-based payments in cash rather than equity.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods
or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At each
balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the
fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised
in profit or loss for the year.


-----

**Alternative Performance Measures**
The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative Performance
Measures (APMs) since its adoption of IFRS in 2005:

- Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from IFRS
profit measures

- EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and depreciation from
IFRS operating profit.

The Board’s view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity
for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative
reporting. It is not intended to be a superior measure to IFRS, however, these
measures are used internally to manage the business. Further information
and the reconciliation to the IFRS measures are included in notes 4 and 5.

**Critical accounting judgements and estimates**
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make
judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on
the amounts recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision, and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty**
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the reporting date that may have a significant risk of causing
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year are discussed below. The assumptions for each estimate are
set out in the relevant note referenced below.

- Defined benefit obligation (note 26): calculation of the Group’s defined benefit
obligation includes a number of assumptions which affect the carrying value
of the obligation.

- Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets: as part of impairment testing, the

Group is required to estimate the recoverable amount of CGUs by estimating
future cash flows. The assumptions involved in estimating the recoverable amount
include future growth rates and the discount rates used. Changing the assumptions
selected by management could significantly affect the amount of any impairment.

- Current tax liability and deferred tax (notes 10 and 11): The Group annually
incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions
around the world, and it also recognises significant changes in deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities all of which are based on management’s


**Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

Debt factoring
During the year, the Group maintained agreements under which amounts
receivable from customers can be sold to a third party on a non-recourse basis.
These receivables are derecognised at the point of sale which is shortly after the
initial recognition of the receivable balance. This derecognition generated a net
cash inflow of £28.6m for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: £82.7m) and
a net reduction in receivables of £110.6m as at 31 December 2023 (2022: £82.7m).

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group has determined that substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownerships of these receivables have been transferred to the third
parties under the facilities, resulting in derecognition of the customer receivables.

IFRS 7 provides further guidance on disclosure requirements where there is continued
involvement in the derecognised financial assets. The Group has determined that an
asset should be recognised in respect of deferred purchase price reserve, which
represents a portion of the original receivable. This reserve is subsequently paid by
the counterparties to the agreements, whether the customer pays the receivable in
full or not. Further disclosures in relation to this receivable can be found in note 22.

Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised,
based on management’s assumptions relating to future taxable profits. Determination
of future taxable profits requires application of judgement and estimates, including:
market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal
prices and other direct input costs, based on management’s expectations of future
changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate. The
estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of
profit as appropriate. Changes in these estimates will affect future profits and therefore
the recoverability of the deferred tax assets.

There are no other critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations
(which are discussed above), that the Directors have made in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies.

**3** **Adoption of new and revised standards**

The group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time
for its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023:

   - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

   - Definition of Accounting Estimates – amendments to IAS 8

   - International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – amendments to IAS 12

   - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single
Transaction – amendments to IAS 12

   - Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2023

**3 Adoption of new and revised standards continued**

There are a number of amendments and clarifications to IFRS, effective in
future years, which have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards,
amendments or clarifications are not expected to significantly affect the Group’s
consolidated results or financial position in the current or future periods.

**4 Special items**

**IFRS and Underlying performance**
The IFRS profit measures show the performance of the Group as a whole and
as such include all sources of income and expense, including both one-off items and
those that do not relate to the Group’s ongoing businesses. To provide additional
clarity on the ongoing trading performance of the Group’s businesses, management
uses ‘Underlying’ performance as an Alternative Performance Measure to plan for,
control and assess the performance of the segments. Underlying performance
differs from the IFRS measures as it excludes Special Items.

**Special Items**
Special Items are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer indication of
the Group’s Underlying performance.

Special Items are either irregular – and therefore including them in the assessment
of a segment’s performance would lead to a distortion of trends – or are technical
adjustments which ensure the Group’s financial statements are in compliance with
IFRS but do not reflect the operating performance of a segment in the year, or both.
An example of the latter is the amortisation of acquired intangibles, which principally
relates to acquired customer relationships. The Group incurs costs, which are
recognised as an expense in the income statement, in maintaining these customer
relationships. The Group considers that the exclusion of the amortisation charge on
acquired intangibles from Underlying performance avoids the potential double counting
of such costs and therefore excludes it as a Special Item from Underlying performance.

The following are consistently disclosed separately as Special Items in order
to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s Underlying performance:

   - Restructuring and site closure costs

   - Sale of business or significant asset

   - Acquisition costs

   - Amortisation of acquired intangible assets

   - Impairment of non-current assets

   - Fair value adjustments in respect of derivative financial instruments
where hedge accounting is not applied

   - Items of income and expense that are considered material, either



- Tax impact of above items

- Settlement of prior period tax issues.

Special Items comprise:

Amortisation of acquired intangibles is the amortisation on the customer lists,
patents, trademarks and trade secrets arising on past acquisitions. The fair value of
the intangible assets arising on past acquisitions are being amortised over periods
of 5-20 years mainly dependent on the characteristics of the customer relationships.


-----

Within continuing operations, Restructuring and site closure costs in
2023 comprised:

- A £3.3m charge in relation to the ongoing integration of the acquired
Adhesive Resins business into the Adhesive Solutions division

- £3.8m of costs in relation to the strategy change and alignment of the
business into its new divisions effective from 2023

- £5.9m of costs for ongoing functional and site rationalisation in the USA and
Europe, as a result of divisional realignment and the sale of the Laminates,
Films and Coated Fabrics business

- A £1.7m charge in relation to demolition and site rationalisation activity
in Malaysia.

Within discontinued operations, Restructuring and site closure costs of £3.3m
were incurred due to the closure of the US paper and carpets business that was
announced in September 2023.

Restructuring and site closure costs in 2022 included charges to integrate the
Adhesive Resins business, site rationalisation costs in Malaysia and Europe,
and costs in relation to the strategy change and alignment of the business into
its new divisions.

Within continuing operations, a £5.6m impairment charge was provided on
the mothballing of the nitrile butadiene latex (NDR) plant in Malaysia. Within
discontinued operations, a £0.8m impairment charge was taken to discontinued
items in the year, relating to lease impairments in the discontinued US paper and
carpets business. The impairment charge in 2022 related to the acquired
Adhesive Resins business.

Acquisition costs and related gains are for the acquisition of Eastman’s Adhesive
Resins business and include £1.9m of costs, related to obligations to the USA
pension schemes. Acquisition costs in 2022 also related to the acquisition of
Eastman’s Adhesive Resins business.

Sale of business mainly related to the proceeds net of any costs, primarily
professional fees, incurred in conjunction with the sale of the Laminates,
Films and Coated Fabrics business to Surteco.

During 2018, the European Commission initiated an investigation into Styrene
monomer purchasing practices of a number of companies, including Synthomer,
operating in the European Economic Area. The Company has fully cooperated with
the Commission throughout the investigation. In 2021, based on the information
available and the resulting assessment of the expected outcome of the investigation a
provision of £57.2m was made. In 2022, the Commission concluded its investigation,
resulting in a fine of £38.5m. In 2023, interest of £0.7m on the settlement was due.


During the year, the Group commenced a process to issue fixed rate unsecured
loan notes, the Group later decided to issue new shares in a rights issue and did
not proceed with the issue of the loan notes. The costs of this process are not
reflective of underlying performance.

In July 2018, the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix euro interest rates
on the full value of the then €440m committed unsecured revolving credit facility.
The fair value movement of the unhedged interest rate derivatives relates to the
movement in the mark-to-market of the swap in excess of the Group’s borrowings.

Continuing taxation Special Items related principally to the movement in foreign
exchange on the uncertain tax provision in relation to a historical tax issue in Malaysia.

Continuing taxation on Special Items is mainly deferred tax credits arising on the
amortisation of acquired intangibles and restructuring and site closure costs.

Discontinuing taxation on Special Items relates principally to the utilisation of
the USA tax losses against the USA tax on the sale of the Laminates, Films and
Coated Fabrics Business.

**5** **Segmental analysis**

The Group’s Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer,
examines the Group’s performance.

As part of the strategy refresh announced in October 2022, the Group has
changed the way it does business to be closer to consumers, more embedded
in customers’ markets, and better able to deliver the sustainable innovations
that will drive success. As of 1 January 2023, the Group now has three new,
market-focused divisions with strong commercial positions and global reach.

The Group’s reportable segments are as follows:

**Coatings & Construction Solutions**
Our specialist polymers enhance the sustainable performance of a wide range of
coatings and construction products. We work across architectural and masonry
coatings, mortar modification, waterproofing and flooring, fibre bonding, and
energy solutions.

**Adhesive Solutions**
Our adhesive solutions bond, modify and compatibilise surfaces and components
for products including tapes and labels, packaging, hygiene, tyres and plastic
modification, helping improve permeability, strength, elasticity, damping,

**10 Taxation continued** **Global Minimum Top-up Tax**
The group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. Pillar Two legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom, the
jurisdiction in which the parent company is incorporated, and will come into effect from 1 January 2024. Since Pillar Two legislation
was not effective at the reporting date, the group has no related current tax exposure. The group applies the exception to
recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in
amendends to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.

Under the legislation, the group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the differrence between its GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction
and the 15% minimum rate. The Group does not expect to be subject to the top-up tax in the normal course of business.

Due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income, the quantitative impact of the enacted legislation
is not yet reasonably estimable. Therefore even for those entities with an accounting effective tax rate above 15% in the normal
course of business, there might still be Pillar Two tax implications. The Group is currently engaged with tax specialists to assist it
with applying the legislation.

**11 Deferred taxation** Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. These assumptions have been based on past experience and
updated in the year in light of the current economic environment.

Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the Group. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted. A pre-tax
discount rate of 11.9% has been used in the above calculations for each CGU (2022: 11.4% for previous Performance Elastomers,
Functional Solutions and Industial Specialities divisions, and 12.3% for previous Adhesive Technologies division).

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for each CGU, derived from the most recent five-year business plans approved by the
Board. The final year cash flow is then assumed to apply into perpetuity with estimated annual growth rates of 2.06 %, 1.9 % and
2.76% for Coatings & Construction Solutions, Adhesive Solutions and Health & Protection and Performance Materials respectively
(2022: 3.1 %, 1.9 %. 2.0 % and 2.0 % for the previous Performance Elastomers, Functional Solutions and Industial Specialities and
Adhesive Technologies divisions respectively). These rates do not exceed average long-term growth rates for relevant markets.

For each CGU, a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on the impairment tests, with scenarios covering increased cost of
capital, the effect of potential carbon taxes, reduced margins and reduction in customer demand. For each CGU, except for
Adhesive Solutions, the Directors believe that there is no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the
recoverable amount is based that would cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the
CGU. For Adhesive Solutions, the primary sensitivities identified were the discount rate and the perpetuity growth rate. Every 0.25%
decrease in perpetuity growth rate yields a decrease of c.£13m in recoverable amount. Every 0.1% increase in discount rate yields a
decrease in recoverable amount of c.£7m.

internally generated intangible asset to be recognised.

During the year, the Group invested a further £9.1m in its Pathway programme
(2022: £19.4m). This programme is designed to deliver a unified operating model
on a single set of integrated systems to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of the Group. The investment in this programme was shown as an asset under
construction until the deployment phase began.

Before accepting a new customer, the Group uses appropriate procedures
to assess the potential customer’s credit quality in order to set a credit limit.

The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the loss allowance for
trade receivables classified at amortised cost, using the lifetime expected loss
provision. The expected credit loss on trade receivables is estimated using
a provision matrix by reference to past default experience and credit rating,
adjusted as appropriate for current observable data. The Group has no
significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large
number of customers. The following table details the risk profile of trade
receivables based on the Group’s provision matrix.

1. AC: amortised cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss.
A more detailed description of the categories can be found in note 2.

The fair value of the Group’s borrowings at 31 December 2023 was £881.5m (31 December 2022: £1,266.8m).

As at 31 December 2023, £4.3m (2022: £9.4m) of the interest rate swap derivative asset was designated as being in
a hedging relationship.

**Financial risk management**
The Group’s policies, approved by the Board, provide written principles on financial risk management and the use of
financial derivatives.

These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group has a policy of hedging significant foreign exchange transactional exposure at operating company level. The Group
regularly reviews its net assets and borrowing currency exposures, borrowing in overseas currencies in order to hedge the net
assets held in those currencies as appropriate. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.


-----

**22 Financial instruments continued** **Currency risk**
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many currencies. As a result, it is
subject to foreign currency risk due to exchange rate movements, which will affect the Group’s transactions and the translation
of the results and underlying net assets of its operations.

To manage the currency risk, the Group uses foreign currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge
overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros, US dollars and Malaysian ringgits. Profit translation
exposures are not hedged.

The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no
material currency exposures to disclose (2022: none).

**Interest rate risk**
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar and euro interest rates. To manage
interest rate risk, the Group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings, and utilises interest rate swaps. These
practices aim to minimise the Group’s net finance charges with acceptable year-on-year volatility.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had in place swap arrangements to fix interest rates on €260m and $125m of borrowings.

The Group’s interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movement on the hedged portion
recognised in equity. Interest paid on these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, within Underlying interest costs.
Fair value movement in the unhedged portion is also recognised in profit and loss, as a Special Item.

After taking account of interest rate swaps, the Group’s currency and interest rate exposure as at 31 December 2023 was:

**22 Financial instruments continued** **Market risk sensitivity analysis**
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Group uses a sensitivity
analysis that estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an
instantaneous increase or decrease of 1.0% in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all
other currencies, from the rates applicable at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 with all other variables remaining
constant. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post-employment benefit liabilities and assets,
and corporate tax payable. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change
in isolation.

There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of
liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

For interest rate derivatives, the mark-to-market adjustment and amount recognised in equity as part of a hedging arrangement,
is estimated using the interest rate sensitivity against the nominal amount.

The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their
translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as
loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency
of the lender or borrower.


-----

**22 Financial instruments continued** **Credit risk**
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Credit risk arises on cash balances, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group’s exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date as disclosed at
the start of this note. A financial asset is in default when the counterparty fails to pay its contractual obligations. Financial assets
are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Credit risk is managed separately for financial and businessrelated credit exposures.

**Financial credit risk**
Synthomer aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored
by the Board. Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and financial institutions with a credit rating of investment
grade and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits. The Group’s policy is designed to ensure
that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Board also
defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted. Synthomer annually reviews the credit limits applied and
regularly monitors the counterparties’ credit quality, reflecting market credit conditions.

**Business-related credit risk**
Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and active risk management
is applied, focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and monitoring procedures. There is no significant
concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables as the Group has a large number of customers who are internationally
dispersed. See note 20 for information on credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

**22 Financial instruments continued** **Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that Synthomer is unable to meet its payment obligations when due, or that it is unable, on an ongoing basis,
to borrow funds at an acceptable price to fund actual or proposed commitments. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows,
and by matching the maturity profiles of assets and liabilities.

The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted contractual cash flows including interest payable for the
Group’s financial liabilities and derivative instruments. The liquidity analysis for lease liabilities is included in note 23. Where interest
payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the
forward yield curve prevailing at the respective year ends. Derivative contracts are presented on a net basis.

**22 Financial instruments continued** Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Synthomer’s financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of
default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead
to an acceleration of maturity on certain borrowings and the inability to access committed facilities. Synthomer was in full
compliance with its financial covenants in respect of its borrowings throughout each of the years presented.

**Fair value measurement**
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date.

As prescribed by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the inputs are as follows:

- Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2 – not level 1 but are observable for that asset or liability either directly or indirectly

- Level 3 – not based on observable market data.

Interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards and swaps are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques
incorporate inputs such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which are used in a discounted cash flow calculation
incorporating the instrument’s term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to
the valuation are observable in active markets, all the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 financial instruments.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps is estimated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows using forward exchange rates, interest rates and prices at the balance sheet date.

There were no transfers of any financial instrument between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the current or prior year.

**22 Financial instruments continued** **Hedge relationships**
The Group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. Strengths of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument is analysed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as
a result of timing, cash flows or value except when the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned.
The change in the credit risk of the hedging instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the
economic relationship.

The notional amounts, contractual maturities and rates of the hedging instruments designated in hedging relationships as of
31 December 2023 by the main risk categories are as follows:

**Hedged risk** **Notional amount** **Maturity** **Range of hedged rates**

**2023**
**Cash flow hedges**

Interest rate swap **Interest rate** **Up to €440m and $125m** **28/08/2018 – 10/10/2027** **0.517% to 4.637% Fixed**

Net investment Currency Up to €370m 01/04/2020 – present 1.11-1.21

Where hedge accounting is applied, hedges are documented and tested for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.

The ratio for hedging instruments designated in both net investment and cash flow hedge relationships was 1:1. Ineffectiveness
could occur on either hedging relationship due to significant changes in counterparty credit risk or a reduction in the notional
amount of the hedged item during the designated hedging period.

The Group designated as a cash flow hedge the interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on its euro borrowings.

In 2023, a loss of £7.7m (2022: £9.7m gain) was recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in respect of these derivatives.
At 31 December 2023, the cash flow hedge reserve includes a cumulative loss of £8.0m (2022: loss of £0.3m), all of which relates
to continuing cash flow hedges. The cash flows are expected to occur between 2023 and 2027.

In the year, the Group’s euro borrowings remained below the total of the interest rate derivative contracts, leading to a balance not
able to be designated as a cash flow hedge. The change in fair value relating to the unhedged portion of the interest rate swaps
was a loss of £1.8m (2022: gain of £25.1m) which was recognised in the income statement within finance costs as a Special Item.

**22 Financial instruments continued**

**Receivables financing**
During the year, the Group continued to sell amounts receivable from customers
to a third party on a non-recourse basis. As a result, £123.3m of trade receivables
were sold and derecognised as at December 2023. A corresponding asset of
£12.7m has been recognised in respect of deferred purchase price reserves,
which represents a portion of the original receivables. This balance has been
recorded within ‘other debtors’ in note 20.

These reserves are subsequently paid by the counterparties to the agreements,
whether the customer pays the receivable in full or not. The fair value of these
assets is considered to be the same as the carrying value.

**Capital management**
The Board is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both
by investing in the business so as to deliver continued improvement in the return
from those investments and by managing the capital structure.

Synthomer manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency and to
provide flexibility to invest through the economic cycle and give efficient access
to debt markets at attractive cost levels. This is achieved by targeting a net debt
to EBITDA ratio between 1.0 and 2.0. In order to finance acquisitions, the Group
may increase the ratio with a view to deleveraging within 12-24 months.

As at 31 December 2023, the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.2x (2022: 3.7x).

In 2022, the Board announced the suspension of dividends. The Board has
confirmed that dividends will remain suspended at least until the Group’s net debt
is less than 3.0x its EBITDA.


**23 Leases**

The Group has a portfolio of leases mainly comprising land and buildings,
chemical storage tanks and vehicles. Further details are given in note 2.

Information in respect of right of use assets, including the carrying amount,
additions and depreciation, are set out in note 17 to these financial statements.
Information in respect of the carrying value is set out below and information in
respect of interest arising on lease liabilities is set out in note 9.

Synthomer also enters into short-term leases and low-value leases which are not
recognised as right of use assets and lease liabilities. The expense recognised
in the year in relation to these leases is not material. Synthomer has no material
exposure to variable lease payments, extension options or committed leases not
yet commenced.

The total cash outflow for leases in the year was as follows:

**26 Retirement benefit obligations** The Group operates a variety of retirement benefit arrangements, covering both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.

**Defined contribution scheme**
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for its employees. Costs recognised in respect of defined
contribution pension plans across the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 were £14m (2022: £12.6m).

The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is re-insured
with an external insurance company.

**Multi-employer schemes**
The Group participates in several tariffs of the Pensionskasse Degussa in Germany, which is a multi-employer pension scheme.
Regular contributions are payable to the scheme by each participating employer for new benefits accruing. The assets of all
participating employers are pooled, and contributions are calculated based on aggregated demographic experience. Therefore
sufficient information is not available to identify the Group’s share of the assets on a consistent and reliable basis, and the Group
accounts for the scheme on a defined contribution basis. The Group expects to make a regular contribution of £2.1m to the scheme
in 2024.

To the extent that there is underfunding in the scheme, deficit contributions are payable based on an actuarial assessment of each
participating employer’s share of the future benefit accrual. At 31 December 2023, there is no indication of any commitment for
additional deficit contributions in excess of regular contributions.

**Defined benefit schemes**

UK
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme is administered by a fund that is legally separate from the Company. The trustees of the
pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees
of the pension scheme are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009, and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined
contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. A triennial actuarial
valuation of the scheme was undertaken in 2021 and completed in 2022. The next triennial valuation is due in 2024.

USA
The Group’s US defined benefit scheme was acquired as part of the OMNOVA acquisition and is administered by a fund which is
legally separate from OMNOVA Solutions Inc. The fiduciary committee is required by law to act in the interest of the fund and is
responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

**26 Retirement benefit obligations**

continued


The scheme was closed to future accrual in 2011, and all retirement benefits since that time are provided by way of a defined
contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned and a formal valuation
is undertaken on an annual basis.

Germany
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in Germany. These schemes are closed to new members. In line with
common practice, these schemes are unfunded and liabilities are settled on a cash basis as they fall due. At each balance sheet
date, obligations are calculated by external actuaries.

Other
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and retirement benefit schemes. For the funded schemes, assets are
held separately from those of the Group. The aggregated pension disclosures for the other defined benefit schemes have been
compiled from a number of actuarial valuations at 31 December 2023.

Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit schemes expose the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

Asset return risk The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan
assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an
increase in the value of the plan assets in bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life
expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

The Group remains committed to funding the UK and USA defined benefit schemes.

Following the 2021 triennial valuation of the UK scheme, which completed in 2022, the Company committed to paying
contributions for the period to 31 March 2024.

The defined benefit obligation of the USA scheme reduced to £8.2m at 31 December 2023. The Group is expecting to contribute
$3m in 2024, rising to $6m in 2025.

The Group’s other defined benefit schemes are largely unfunded, with minimal plan assets. Liabilities from these schemes are
settled on a cash basis as they fall due.

**Actuarial assumptions**
The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**2023** 2022

**UK** **US** **Germany** **Other** UK US Germany Other

Rate of increase in pensions in payment **2.90%** **0.00%** **2.50%** **2.1%-9%** 3.00% 0.00% 1.00% 2.00%-3.70%

Rate of increase in pensions in deferment **2.60%** **0.00%** **1.00%** **3.5%-9%** 2.70% 0.00% 2.50% 2.00%-3.70%

Discount rate **4.50%** **4.94%** **3.30% 3.1%-9.25%** 5.00% 5.20% 3.70% 0.27%-5.16%

Inflation assumption **3.05%** **0.00%** **2.25%** **2%-2.4%** 3.10% 0.00% 2.25% 2.00%-2.40%

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics.
Mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables and, where appropriate, include an allowance
for future improvements in life expectancy. In addition, where credible data exists, actual plan experience is taken
into account. The Group’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the USA and Germany where, using the
mortality tables adopted, the expected lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at
age 65 in 20 years’ time is as follows:

**2023** 2022

**Retiring today** **Retiring in 20 years** Retiring today Retiring in 20 years

**UK** **US** **Germany** **UK** **US** **Germany** UK US Germany UK US Germany

Males **85.9** **86.6** **85.8** **86.7** **87.5** **88.5** 87.3 86.4 85.6 88.9 87.4 88.4

Females **88.3** **87.6** **89.2** **89.1** **88.6** **91.4** 89.5 87.5 89.0 91.0 88.5 91.3

The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 12 years for the UK
scheme (2022: 11.0 years), 6.8 years for the USA scheme (2022: 6.8 years) and 13.9 years for the German schemes
(2022: 13.9 years).

**Sensitivity analysis**
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and
mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:

**Increase in scheme liabilities**


**UK**
**£m**


**US**
**£m**


**Germany**

**£m**


Discount rate (decrease of 1%) **34.5** **15.4** **10.3**

Future mortality rate (one year increase in expectancy) **12** **5.0** **2.7**

The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions, the same method
(present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the
reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet

following the share consolidation, the Company shareholders were invited to
subscribe to a rights issue of 140,200,818 ordinary 1p shares at an issue
price of 197 pence per share on the basis of six new ordinary 1p shares for
every one consolidated ordinary share held on 26 September 2023.

The rights issue resulted in gross proceeds of £276.2m. Shares totalling
129,881,397 were taken up by existing shareholders (93%) with the remaining
rump of 10,319,421 being underwritten. The rights issue completed on

**30 Discontinued operations** On 13 December 2022, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Laminates, Films and Coated Fabrics
businesses to Surteco North America, Inc. The UK Financial Conduct Authority approved the circular to Shareholders on 16 December.
Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained on 11 January 2023 with the transaction completing on 28 February 2023 with
net cash proceeds of $262m. The gain on disposal was £61.5m (see note 4).

The associated assets and liabilities were consequently presented for sale in the 2022 financial statements.

All discontinued operations form part of the Health & Protection and Performance Materials division.

On 29 September 2023, it was announced that Synthomer intended to shut down its North America Paper and Carpet business
before the end of 2023, honouring existing contractual commitments to customers until its exit. This falls as part of the wider
previously announced strategy to exit a number of non-core businesses which includes the paper and carpet businesses globally.

**The Synthomer Employee Benefit Trust**
The Company established a trust, the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust,
on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees – enabling the obligations
under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto
Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to be met.

The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent
company located in Guernsey.

At 31 December 2023, the Trust held 708 (2022: 73,413) ordinary shares in the
Company with a market value of £0.0m (2022: £0.1m).

The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under
option. Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.

**34 Post balance sheet event**

During 2022, the European Commission concluded its investigation into styrene
monomer purchasing practices, and the final settlement amount of £38.5m was
transferred to other payables. The Group paid the settlement amount plus interest
in January 2024 as agreed with the EC.

On March 2024, the Group agreed amendments with its banks to the financial
covenants on its revolving credit facility and UK Export Finance term loans.
Accordingly, the net debt: EBITDA ratios required under the covenant have been
set at not more than 6.0x in June 2024 and 5.75x in December 2024, with ratios
of not more than 5.0x in June 2025 and 4.75x in December 2025 conditional on a
refinancing of the senior loan notes. In addition, the RCF amount was changed
from $400m to €300m.

As part of the Group’s previously announced non-core portfolio rationalisation
programme, there are three formal divestment processes underway for non-core
businesses in Europe, currently incorporated within the Health & Protection and
Performance Materials division. Given progress made since the year end, the
Directors now consider it is more likely than not that at least one of these
processes will lead to a divestment within the next 12 months.
