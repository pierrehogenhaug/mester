100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date
plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, at any time prior to

changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may
require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any. See “Description of the Notes”.
The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior
indebtedness (including the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement (as defined herein)) and will rank senior to all of the Issuer’s future
indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured
indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally
subordinated to all indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

**Notice to U.S. Investors**

The Notes will be sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act. In making
your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and
agreements. See “Transfer Restrictions”. This Offering Memorandum is being provided in connection
with offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the
Guarantees described in this Offering Memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or
approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission
in the United States or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC, any
state securities commission in the United States, or any such securities commission or authority passed
upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor
should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without
prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Notice to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation, from the requirement to produce a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. In relation to each Member State of the EEA (each, a “Member
**State”), no offer of Notes to the public in that Member State may be made other than at any time to any**
legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; provided that no such
offer of Notes shall require us or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 1 of the
Prospectus Regulation, or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only
do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize,
the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes
in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe for the Notes.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Member State will be
deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning
of Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. The Issuer, each Initial Purchaser and its affiliates, and
others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and
agreement.

Act of July 11, 2018 on the public offering of investment instruments and the admission of investment
instruments to trading on a regulated market (the “Belgian Prospectus Act”), as such term is defined
therein, and/or on the basis of any other exemption as referred to in Article 1, paragraph 4 of the
Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering has not been and will not be notified to, and this Offering Memorandum has not been, and

any other information circular, brochure or similar documents may be distributed, directly or indirectly, to,

Belgium pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation and the Belgian Prospectus Act or (ii) any person
qualifying as a consumer (consument/consommateur) within the meaning of the Belgian code of
economic law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit économique) dated February 23, 2013, as
amended (the “Belgian Code of Economic Law”).

**Notice to Investors in the Czech Republic**

The Notes may only be offered, sold and acquired in the Czech Republic in accordance with the provisions
of the Prospectus Regulation, Czech Act No. 256/2004 Coll., on the Conduct of Business on Capital
Markets (the “Capital Markets Act”), and any other applicable European and Czech law.

This Offering Memorandum, and any other document related to the Notes, (i) does not constitute a
prospectus within the meaning of the applicable European and Czech law, (ii) has not been and will not
be approved by, or notified to, the Czech National Bank (the “CNB”) and (iii) does not constitute a public
offering of any Notes to the public in the Czech Republic. No notification has been made to, and no
permit has been sought or obtained from, the CNB in connection with (i) the issue of any Notes, (ii) the
admission of Notes for trading on a regulated market in the Czech Republic or (iii) a public offering of

distributed, in the Czech Republic only under one or more exemptions from the obligation to publish a
prospectus available under the Prospectus Regulation, e.g. to qualified investors within the meaning of
Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation.

Therefore, this Offering Memorandum is strictly for private use, and the offer is only being made to
recipients to whom the document is personally addressed and does not constitute an offer or
advertisement to the public.

The Notes are not issued under Czech law and the offering of Notes pursuant to this Offering
Memorandum does not constitute “an issue of bonds” (vydání dluhopisů) within the meaning of Czech
Act No. 190/2004 Coll., on Bonds, as amended.

**Notice to Investors in France**

This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in the context of a public offering (other than to
qualified investors in France) within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial
Code (Code monétaire et financier) and Title I of Book II of the Règlement Général of the Autorité des
_marchés financiers (the French Financial Markets Authority) (the “AMF”) and therefore has not been and_

Neither the Offering nor this offering memorandum has not been registered with the Spanish Securities
Market Commission (Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, “CNMV”). Therefore the Notes may not

Articles 205 and 207 of the Spanish Securities Market Act.

**Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved by, an authorized person
in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only to, and is directed solely at, (x) persons who (i) are
outside the United Kingdom, (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling
within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as
amended (the “Order”), or (iii) are high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order


-----

and (y) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the
meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) in connection with
the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering
Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who
are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum
relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any
person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its
contents.

The securities described in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the
Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the
UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In some cases,
these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including
the words “believes”, “estimates”, “aims”, “targets”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “continues”,
“ongoing”, “potential”, “product”, “projects”, “guidance”, “seeks”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “would”, “should” or,
in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies,
plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. The absence of such terminology does not
necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include
matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering
Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations
concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects,
competition in areas of our business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which
we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution
you that forward-looking statements are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions and are not
guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made
in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition,
even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in
which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in
subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause those material differences include:

   - the effect of increases in raw material costs or the unavailability of raw materials on our business,
financial condition and results of operations;

   - the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on our raw material costs;

   - the effect of disruptions to or a loss of one of our production facilities;

   - our ability to compete successfully with our competitors;

   - our ability to maintain our on-time service delivery record;

   - the effect of product recall or liability claims, a shifting regulatory environment and/or any adverse
publicity;

  - the impact of broader and stricter medical device regulations to which we are subject and any
increases in enforcement;

   - our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;

   - our ability to retain key customers;

   - our ability to successfully integrate any future acquisitions;

  - the effect of any disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics (including the recent
COVID-19 pandemic) or similar widespread health concerns on our business;

   - risks inherent to our global operations, including currency devaluations and the effect of regional
or jurisdictional instability on our international operations;

  - changes in the requirements of our customers or end-users of our products;

  - changes in the payment and reimbursement policies of governments and other parties;

   - reliance on our executive management team and our ability to recruit, train, motivate and retain
employees;

   - the effect of uninsured losses;

  - employment disputes and increased labor costs;

   - disruption due to failure of our information systems;

  - breaches of data privacy regulations;


-----

  - changes in consumer attitudes and expectations with respect to sustainability and environmental
matters;

   - adverse publicity and risks associated with our use of social media;

   - the effects of adverse market condition on the carrying value of our assets;

   - the effects of changes in tax rules on our results;

   - the effects of legal and arbitration proceedings;

   - the effects of certain competition and antitrust laws;

   - risks associated with our dealings with third parties;

   - interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate debt instruments;

   - our ability to generate the funds needed to service our debt; and

   - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors”.

The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as exhaustive.
Due to such uncertainties and risks, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. We urge you to read
the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” for more detailed_
discussions of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry and geographic
markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking
events described in this Offering Memorandum may not occur. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. We may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible for us
to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

The forward-looking statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently
available to our management. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can
give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. All subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Statements**

The financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is taken from (i) the Issuer’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union (“IFRS”), and (ii) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of
and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019
and 2020 were subject to an audit by PwC Bedrijfsrevisoren BV / PwC Reviseurs d’Entreprises SRL, the
Issuer’s statutory auditors for those years. The statutory auditor’s report of PwC Bedrijfsrevisoren BV /
PwC Reviseurs d’Entreprises SRL on the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2019, without qualifying the audit opinion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of
matter with respect to the outbreak of COVID-19 whereby attention is drawn to the report of the board of
directors and Section 7.32 (Subsequent events) of the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2019 contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, in which the Group
expresses their view that, although the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a significant
impact on the Group’s operations in 2020, such consequences do not have a material impact on the
Group’s financial position for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we restated our
previously published divisional revenue figures for the year ended December 31, 2019 to reflect the effect
of a shift in responsibility for one customer from our AMEAA division to our Healthcare division, effective
January 1, 2020. Overall revenue for these periods is unchanged, and we have not restated these figures
for any prior period.

To facilitate the review of the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and to present our financial
information in a comparable manner:

  - where we present revenue by division for the year ended December 31, 2020 alongside revenue
by division for the year ended December 31, 2019, we present such information for the year ended
December 31, 2019 on a restated basis, as it appears in our consolidated financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - where we present revenue by division for the year ended December 31, 2019 alongside revenue
by division for the year ended December 31, 2018, we present such information for the year ended
December 31, 2019 on a non-restated basis, as it appears in our consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019; and

  - where we present revenue by division for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019
and 2018, we present such information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
December 2018 on a restated basis, as if this shift in responsibility had been effective as of
January 1, 2018.

The Issuer adopted the new guidelines for lease accounting retrospectively, with the cumulative effect of
initially applying the standard recognized on January 1, 2019 (modified retrospective approach) in
accordance with the transition requirements of IFRS 16. In the consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2019, the comparative financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was not restated to reflect the retrospective impact of this adoption. Accordingly,
except as otherwise expressly identified herein, financial information presented for the year ended
December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum has not been adjusted for the retrospective application
of IFRS 16.

This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months
ended March 31, 2021. This financial data is unaudited and has been calculated by adding (i) the audited
consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) the unaudited interim
consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and then subtracting
(iii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2020.
The unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 has been
prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of
our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors. The unaudited
consolidated financial information for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 presented herein is not


-----

required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
The unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 is not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period and should not be used as
the basis for, or prediction of, an annualized calculation.

Consistent with the Issuer’s public reporting obligations, the terms of the Indenture will require that the
Issuer furnish financial statements to holders of the Notes on a semi-annual basis. The unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer and the financial information for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 presented herein are provided solely for convenience
purposes in connection with this Offering, and the Issuer will not be furnishing quarterly financial
statements on an ongoing basis following the completion of this Offering.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information on an as adjusted basis to give
pro forma effect to the Transactions, including financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the
Transactions on the indebtedness of the Group as if the Transactions had occurred as of March 31,
2021. The as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not
represent what the actual indebtedness of the Group would have been had the Transactions occurred on
March 31, 2021; nor does it purport to project our indebtedness at any future date. The as adjusted
financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of
the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments, nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

**Other Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin,
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow, that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS. EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance cost, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined
as EBITDA before non-recurring income and expenses. Non-recurring income and expenses are defined
as those items that are considered by management not to relate to transactions, projects and adjustments
to the value of assets and liabilities taking place in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities.
Non-recurring income and expenses are presented separately, due to their size or nature, so as to allow
users of the consolidated financial statements of the Company to get a better understanding of the
normalized performance of the Company. Non-recurring expenses relate to:

  - acquisition-related expenses;

  - changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context of business
combinations;

  - changes to the Group structure, business restructuring costs, including costs related to the
liquidation of subsidiaries and the closure, opening or relocations of factories; and

   - impairment of assets and major litigations.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Free cash flow is defined as
net cash generated from operating activities (as presented in the consolidated cash flow statement, i.e.
including income taxes paid), less capital expenditures (defined as purchases of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets), less repayment of lease liabilities and including cash (used in)/from
disposal. Like-for-like (LFL) is defined as at constant currency excluding change in perimeter of
consolidation or acquisitions.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures such as
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not
measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles. In particular, you should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow as an
alternative to: (i) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a


-----

measure of our operating performance; (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs; or (iii) any other measures of performance under
generally accepted accounting principles. Some of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or
contractual commitments; and

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.

For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit and free cash flow to operating
profit, see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data”.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process
of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the notes to
our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Rounding**

Certain figures contained in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information, have been subject
to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column or a row
in tables contained in this Offering Memorandum may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that
column or row.

**Industry and Market Data**

This Offering Memorandum contains statistical data, estimates and forecasts that are based on
independent industry publications, such as those published in databases and reports by Euromonitor
International Limited (“Euromonitor”), Nielsen, IQVIA Inc. (“IQVIA”), or other publicly available
information, as well as other information based on our internal sources. This information involves many
assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to these estimates or place
undue reliance on this information. This information has been obtained from sources believed to be
reliable, but some information may be derived from estimates or subjective judgments or may not have
been subject to limited audit or validation. Neither we nor Euromonitor, Nielsen or IQVIA have
independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in these industry publications
and other publicly available information and make no guarantees as to the accuracy thereof. In addition,
we believe that data regarding the industry and industry market and sales positions, shares, market sizes
and growth provide general guidance but are inherently imprecise. None of the industry publications
referred to in this Offering Memorandum were prepared on our or on our affiliates’ behalf or at our
expense. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding any third-party information presented
in this Offering Memorandum, such information is based in part on official statistics, trade associations,
trade press, company research, trade interviews and trade services, and as such have not been
independently verified by the relevant provider in each case. The industry in which we operate is subject
to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the
section titled “Risk Factors”, that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these
publications and other publicly available information, including “Forward-Looking Statements” which are
not guarantees of future performance. This Offering Memorandum also contains illustrations and charts
derived from our internal information, which has not been independently verified unless specifically
indicated.

**Trademarks and Trade Names**

We have proprietary and/or license rights to certain trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction
with the operation of our businesses. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trademarks
or trade names to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other companies.
Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company appearing in this Offering
Memorandum belongs to its respective holder. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, trade names and
copyrights referred to in this Offering Memorandum may be listed without the ©, ® and TM symbols, but
we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor
to these trademarks, trade names and copyrights.

**Overview**

We are a leading international provider of personal hygiene solutions, with a focus and expertise in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care products. Our products are distributed in more than 110
countries, both through leading retailer brands and through our own brands such as bbTips, BioBaby,
Pompom, Bigfral, Canbebe, Canped, ID, Cremer, Affective, Chicolastic and Serenity. Headquartered in
Belgium, we manufacture and supply retailer brands, partner brands and our own Ontex brands in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care to consumers and customers in Europe, the Americas, the
Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia, and as of March 31, 2021 employed approximately 9,600 people
globally.

We primarily sell products to large retailers to be sold under their brands (“retailer brands”) and a range
of own-brand products under our proprietary labels (“Ontex brands”), with the mix between retailer
brand and Ontex brand sales varying by product category and geography. In Europe, we primarily sell our
products to retailers, manufacturing products to be sold under established retailer brands and helping
them to establish or enhance their own brands. We believe that we are the largest supplier of retailer
brand personal hygiene products in Europe by sales, with a market share we estimate to be around
double that of the second-largest supplier of retailer brands in the same region. We also sell Ontex brand
products to institutional and other customers (such as drugstores and specialty medical retailers), in
particular through our Healthcare division. Outside of Europe, our sales mix varies by geography and the
maturity of a given market. For instance, in North America we sell retailer brand products, and have also
begun to capitalize on shifts in consumer preference by partnering with third-party brands which are
mostly active in the lifestyle market (“third-party brands”); in selected other markets across the Americas,
the Middle East, Africa and Asia, we primarily sell Ontex brand products. We also sell a small amount of
finished products to other manufacturers, which is referred to as contract manufacturing. For the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, 52% and 54%
of our revenue was generated from retailer brands (including third-party brands and our contract
manufacturing activities), with the remaining 48% and 46% being generated from Ontex brands.

Our commercial activities are organized across three divisions, namely (i) Europe, (ii) Americas, Middle
East, Africa and Asia, and (iii) Healthcare:

  - Our Europe division is predominantly focused on the production and sale of retailer brands in
Western, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. Our contract
manufacturing activities also fall within this division. The Europe division accounted for 40.0% of
our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 41.8% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020;

  - Our Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia (or “AMEAA”) division is predominantly focused on
the production, marketing and sales of our own local or regional brands, with the notable exception
of North America, where we primarily sell retailer brands and third-party brands. We conduct our
sales and marketing activities through dedicated teams in North America, Mexico and Central
America, South America, and the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The AMEEA division accounted for
37.3% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 37.1% of our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Our Healthcare division is focused on institutional customers (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes and
homecare channels) to which we sell Ontex expert brands and distributor brands. Marketing is
organized at the divisional level, with dedicated support at the area level. Sales activities in
Healthcare are split into three geographical areas: (i) Australia and New Zealand, (ii) France,
Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, Germany, the United Kingdom & Ireland and


-----

distributors and (iii) Italy and Iberia. The Healthcare division accounted for 22.7% of our revenue
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 21.1% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

In addition, our operations activities (including our procurement, manufacturing, supply chain,
engineering, quality assurance and EH&S functions) are consolidated into our Group Supply function.
This centralized set-up ensures that we drive scale and productivity across our global operations, thanks
to our end-to-end ownership of the product lifecycle: the creation of the right products, at the right cost,
with the right materials and the right technologies, with a constant focus on product quality and safety.

Our core product categories include:

  - Baby Care, which includes baby diapers, baby pants and wet wipes. Baby Care products
accounted for 53% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 56% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Adult Incontinence, which comprises light, medium and heavy incontinence solutions for sale to
both retail and specialized (e.g. healthcare institutions and pharmacies) channels. Our Adult
Incontinence products include adult diapers, adult pants, pads and underpads. We also offer
continence care services to support healthcare institutions (e.g. Odobin). Adult Incontinence
products accounted for 35% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 33%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Feminine Care, which includes a range of products such as ultra-towels, fluff towels, panty liners
and tampons, sold through both retailer brands and our own Ontex brands. Through a broad range
of Feminine Care products, we are able to respond to the different needs and lifestyles of women.
All have innovative features that offer protection and comfort at all times and in a variety of
circumstances. Feminine Care products accounted for 10% of our revenue for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 10.2% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Other products, which comprise complementary personal hygiene products, including face masks,
gloves, body washes and skin care products. These are mostly traded products, purchased by us
from third parties and sold commercially. Other products accounted for 2% of our revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 1.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31,
2020.

We are headquartered in Erembodegem (Aalst), Belgium and have a well-balanced manufacturing and
sales footprint. We have 19 production facilities located across Europe (including two in Belgium, one in
the Czech Republic, one in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Poland, and one in Spain), Turkey,
Algeria, Russia, Australia, Pakistan, Ethiopia, two in Mexico, Brazil and the U.S. In the U.S., we are in the
process of expanding our operations with the construction of a new production facility in North-Carolina
where we also intend to commence baby diaper production in early 2022. We have 28 sales and
marketing sites globally, through which we make sales in more than 110 countries worldwide. The wide
reach of our production facilities and sales offices enables us to operate across a broad range of markets
in a cost-effective manner. We believe they also allow us to be the only hygiene manufacturing company
capable of effectively serving a range of increasingly international customers. We employed
approximately 9,600 full time equivalent employees as of March 31, 2021.

We enjoy deep and longstanding relationships with our top customers, which are primarily retailers and
third-party brand owners. In certain markets, our relationships with top customers date to our entry into
that market, and are often decades in duration. We also benefit from a diversified customer base, with our
largest customer accounting for 5.9% of our revenue and our ten largest customers accounting for 33.0%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

By geographic market, for the year ended December 31, 2020, 47% of our revenue was attributable to
Western Europe, 12% to Eastern Europe, 28% to the Americas and 13% to the rest of the world.

During the period from 2015 through 2020, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.3%
(including the impact of acquisitions), with average organic revenue growth (i.e. growth at reported
currency, excluding the impact of acquisitions) of approximately 0.7% per year.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our revenue was €480 million, our EBITDA was €42 million
and our Adjusted EBITDA was €50 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue was
€2,087 million, our EBITDA was €198 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €236 million.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Focus on attractive product categories with strong market dynamics_**

We are a leading international producer of hygienic disposable products, with a broad global footprint
and a focus on innovation that we believe will allow us to capitalize on structural growth trends across our
product categories and geographic markets. In 2020, the global hygienic disposables market was an
€85 billion market, split into 3 main categories: baby care products (representing €42 billion), feminine
care products (representing €27 billion), and adult incontinence products (representing €16 billion).
Between 2015 and 2020, the global hygienic disposables market has grown at a compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%, driven primarily by strong growth in adult incontinence (6.1% CAGR),
followed by baby care (4.6% CAGR) and feminine care (3.4% CAGR). Growth in each of these markets
is driven by favourable underlying secular trends across all geographies, including ageing populations,
demographic growth (for instance, projected increases in the number of babies aged 0 to 2 years, the
target market for our Baby Care products) and economic development in our markets. We estimate that
our exposure to this overall market growth over 2015-2020 is slightly lower, a CAGR of approximately
2.8%, given our geographical business mix, in particular our lower share of sales generated by fastgrowing Asian markets.

Apart from robust growth prospects, our products benefit from a relative seasonal inelasticity of demand
as non-discretionary consumer staples. Demand for our products is generally not subject to seasonality,
and has historically demonstrated stable growth even during periods of adverse economic conditions. In
fact, in economic downturns, consumer demand tends to shift to more affordable retailer brand
alternatives, in which we are a leading player. Once consumers trial retailer brands, they tend not to revert
back to more expensive A-brand products. Additionally, our products are strategically important to our
retailer customers; these products are key drivers of traffic in their stores and attract profitable shoppers,
including households with children.

We also believe that we are well positioned to benefit from two significant ongoing shifts in shopper and
consumer behavior and related competitive dynamics. First, consumers are increasingly seeking out
affordable alternatives to “A-brands” (in particular, favoring the retailer and value brands that represent a
significant majority of our product offer and revenue). Our leadership in retailer brands in Europe and our
focus on affordable branded products in emerging markets leave us ideally positioned to meet this shifting
demand.

In addition, several consumer trends are driving the premiumization of our three product categories.
Firstly, consumers are turning increasingly to premium third-party “lifestyle” brands aimed at specific
consumer segments and generally sold online or through subscription services. These brands are often
positioned as sustainable and of high quality (e.g. organic composition, natural features). In the US,
these third-party brands expanded by approximately 280% over the period from 2015 to 2020. We are the
preferred supplier for companies entering this space, particularly in the US, where we maintain strong
relationships with key players in the baby care and feminine care categories. Secondly, a desire for
convenience is driving consumer preferences toward more sophisticated products, as illustrated by the
shift from open diapers to closed baby pants and connected adult diapers, which is expected to positively
impact our sales mix.

Finally, shifts in the preferred channels by which consumers purchase our products are expected to
create further growth opportunities for Ontex. For example, sales of our products through online
e-commerce channels have benefited from strong momentum over the past few years, and COVID-19
has accelerated this trend. In 2020, e-commerce sales of baby care, feminine care and adult incontinence
products represented approximately 17%, or €13 billion, of overall sales of €75 billion (as compared to
10% of €63 billion in 2016, and 13% of €69 billion in 2018), according to Euromonitor. The fact that
retailer brands are currently underrepresented in retailers’ online sales represents an additional growth
opportunity for Ontex. Additionally, a shift in preference from long-term adult care institutions (who have
comprised an important customer base for our Adult Incontinence products) to homecare (i.e. self-pay)
solutions within Adult Incontinence also represents a significant opportunity for Ontex. We have strong
Adult Incontinence category expertise and trusted expert brands which we leverage to accelerate sales
through mass retail as well as through specialized retail channels such as pharmacies and e-commerce.

**_Competitive advantages stemming from the scale of our business_**

We are a leading in supplier for trusted local brands, and benefit from strong market positions in several
different geographies and market segments. In Europe, we are the leading retailer brand company in


-----

baby care, with a market share that according to management estimates is approximately double that of
our nearest competitor, rising to 2.8 and 3.5 times larger, respectively, in Adult Incontinence and Feminine
Care. We are also a close number three by market share in the healthcare segment. Thanks to these
strongholds, we estimate that we are the number 3 player overall in Europe. In emerging markets such as
Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan, we have leading first or second positions, thanks to the
strength of our trusted local brands. Moreover, we have a become a preferred partner for third-party
brands, particularly in the United States.

Our strong position as an international hygiene player drives our scale and provides us with competitive
advantages in the areas of customer relationships, manufacturing, R&D and procurement. As a result of
our broad geographic reach spanning 110 countries across 5 continents, we have been able to build and
maintain deep relationships with leading retailers and aim to act as a single-source provider for retailers
across the various geographies in which they operate. Thanks to our broad operational footprint (19
factories across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Australia; four R&D centers of
excellence and three R&D hubs), we are among the few companies capable of serving increasingly
international customers and expanding alongside them into new markets. In addition, our overall scale
has also allowed us to develop strong manufacturing capabilities, which have enabled us to continuously
optimize our cost base, while the breadth of our manufacturing footprint allows us to respond quickly and
effectively to changes in customers’ requirements while minimizing distribution costs. We believe that our
scale also supports significant investments in R&D. Despite offering a wide product portfolio and options
for differentiation to our customers, we are able to leverage our scale across common product platforms
and R&D developments. This in turn allows us to offer products of comparable quality to those of our
branded competitors and to continue to deliver innovations and cost-saving opportunities.

Our scale also enables us to effectively control our costs, for instance in the centralized procurement of
raw materials, including arrangements that allow us to benefit from volume discounts. Finally, centralized
organizational set-ups for selected corporate functions and capabilities (e.g. operations, human resources
and product innovation) allow us to further leverage our scale at efficient cost.

**_High quality products across partner-branded and own-branded labels_**

Hygienic disposables are complex products requiring deep expertise in raw materials and production
technologies. Ontex has mastered these technologies through its long history in the industry, through
continuous investments in our in-house capabilities, and by leveraging the know-how of our supplier
partners. Over the years, we have broadened our R&D footprint to four centers of excellence and three
R&D hubs, each co-located at manufacturing sites to ensure a strong symbiosis with operations and
quality departments. We work closely with and maintain close proximity to our customers, to ensure that
we understand the latest developments in their markets and evolution of their needs. This consumer &
customer proximity as well as our deep category expertise feed our innovation pipeline. Our R&D teams
then develop in-house technologies to deliver these innovations. We have our own in-house engineering
department which designs, constructs and adapts production machines to our standards and
requirements. As a result of our industry-leading R&D capabilities, Ontex has a rich portfolio of
significantly innovative and high-quality products. This portfolio enables us to meet our customers’ and
end-consumers’ demands for high-quality yet affordable products, competitive to those offered by the
leading A-brands and customized further to the demands of our customers.

In independent panel tests, laboratory tests and reviews, many of our products receive quality ratings
that are comparable to and sometimes even exceeding those of equivalent branded products. For
instance, the absorbency level of our newest generation of baby diapers tested in independent
laboratories such as Hy-Tec shows a higher level of absorption in our products as compared to that of
leading branded diapers. Additionally, thanks to our patented Secondry[®] technology, we were the first
retailer brand manufacturer in Europe capable of matching the same “instant dryness” qualities as our
primary branded baby diaper competitor, a feature they have advertised as a point of superiority for
several years, thereby setting us ahead of most of our retailer brand competitors.

Another example of leveraging our scale, know-how and intellectual property to create innovative new
products is our development of absorbent products with a channel inside the absorbing core. This channel
technology has been proven in independent Hy-Tec laboratories to absorb fluids at up to twice the speed
as non-channel products. We rolled out this technology on baby diapers across several of our geographic
markets in Europe, the U.S., Mexico and Turkey. In Brazil, we debuted this technology in the market on
our PomPom brand before the leading A-brand upgraded their product with a similar technology. Moreover,
to maximize the value of this innovation, we applied the underlying technology on other products,


-----

including our Feminine Care ultra-towels. This has resulted in a product that absorbs even faster than
comparable products from our chief competitors. We also plan on applying this technology to some
ranges of our Adult Incontinence products, which we believe will differentiate us from our Adult
Incontinence competitors.

Our ability to supply high-quality products that can compete with those of branded manufacturers is of
paramount importance in retaining and winning new business from retailer brand customers. Our
customers invest in quality-led products for their store brands, believing that a quality own-label offer is a
decisive factor for shoppers in choosing their “go-to” store. As a result, retailers maintain and demand of
us very strict quality requirements, including inspections of our production facilities.

Quality is at the very heart of all of our activities. We take compliance and product safety very seriously
and have implemented a rigorous system of controls, audits and certification to support our high
standards. All of our sites operate by the same Ontex Quality Policy, which is supported by ISO, BRC and
IFS certifications. Our functions, production units and sales offices are all ISO 9001 certified (certification
pending in Karachi, Pakistan). Our plants producing medical devices (mainly incontinence products) and
tampons are ISO13485 certified. Our systems are regularly audited by external certification bodies as
well as customers.

Many of our products also undergo additional external accreditations such as the Dermatest skin safety
label, the Allergy Certified label, the Oekotex certification that tests for harmful substances, or the GOTS
label (compliance with Global Organic Textile Standards). We believe that this demonstrated commitment
to product quality and safety makes us a reliable and trusted partner—for our retail customers and end
consumers—and enables us to build solid and longstanding customer relationships.

**_Deep and longstanding relationships with leading retailers and third-party brands and a_**
**_diversified customer base_**

We enjoy deep relationships with the largest retailers in markets where we operate, such as Europe,
North America, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Turkey. Depending on the market, we sell to retailers our
retailer brands (Europe, North America, Australia) or our portfolio of over 30 own-label Ontex brands
(Mexico, Brazil, Turkey). We leverage these relationships to offer our customers products across all
categories and the various geographies in which they operate, with the aim of becoming a single-source
provider of disposable hygiene products. We currently supply our products through over 200 retailer
brands globally and believe we are the only company able to serve increasingly international customers.

In Europe, we provide retailers with predominantly retailer brands, which is to say that we design,
manufacture and market personal hygiene products sold under retailers’ own brands. We have strong
relationships with international and national retailers in several markets, and our relationships with these
retailers allow us to grow as they expand their businesses (including through market share gains and
distribution expansion). We are also able to generate incremental growth through the introduction of new
products picked up by these retailer customers.

In North America and Mexico, a significant portion of our revenues is also generated by sales of retailer
brand products (with an increasing importance of online channels). In Mexico, we provide them with both
retailer brands and our own Ontex brands. In both the US and Mexico, key customers purchasing our
products for sale under their own-brands include large national and international retail chains.

We also enjoy deep relationships with leading third-party brands—either A-brands or smaller third-party
brands sold primarily via e-commerce—for whom we undertake contract manufacturing. Thanks to our
strong Product & Development capabilities, we are the preferred partner for many of these third-party
brand customers to develop the differentiated offerings that will support their growth and bring innovative
products to their consumers.

Our business nonetheless remains relatively diversified, with our largest customer accounting for 5.9% of
our revenue and our ten largest customers accounting for 33.0% of our consolidated revenue in the year
ended December 31, 2020.

**_Broad manufacturing footprint with well-invested asset base and flexible operating capabilities_**

We have a broad manufacturing footprint, with 19 production facilities located across 17 countries, 4
centers of excellence and 3 R&D hubs, which allows us to meet the needs of our customers with a
multi-national presence in a flexible and agile way. Thanks to this global presence, we believe we are the


-----

only company among retailer brand producers to be able to serve increasingly international customers.
We also believe that we are able to offer customers competitive prices since our manufacturing footprint
allows us to leverage scale and optimize logistics costs.

We continuously consider opportunities to optimize our operations, and have made investments in order
to improve our production efficiency while also positioning us for future growth. For instance, over the last
three years, we have (i) constructed a new factory in Radomsko (Poland) to optimize cost-to-serve for our
European customers, (ii) acquired external Feminine Care assets from Albaad to support our growth in
U.S., (iii) built a production facility in the U.S. to localize baby diaper production, (iv) upgraded diaper
production lines to newer technologies in Brazil, (v) rolled out new baby pants lines in Europe, Mexico,
Pakistan and Brazil and (vi) added several new tampon lines in Germany to support our growth. With
these recent and ongoing initiatives, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our
revenue with limited additional capital expenditure requirements. In coming years, management expects
capital expenditures will remain broadly in line with 2020 levels, at a run-rate level of approximately 4.0%
of revenue excluding special projects.

We also maintain a continuous focus on cost excellence in our end-to-end supply chain. We continuously
invest in improving the efficiency of our factories and warehouses through, among other things, planned
maintenance, machine upgrades, automation systems and racking systems to increase storage capacity.
Additionally, we have advanced in-house manufacturing excellence and engineering capabilities.
Furthermore, as part of our T2G organizational transformation initiative, we have defined and rolled out
manufacturing and warehousing best practices to all Ontex locations, which will remain a strong focus
going forward.

We also constantly seek to optimize the use of our assets across our footprint, either by shifting volumes
and lines across our network or closing factories. From 2018 through 2019 we closed two factories, in
Brazil and China.

The flexibility of our production facilities allows us to deliver customized products to our customers and to
respond to changes in demand for our products by reallocating production across our production facilities.
It also enables us to respond with agility when facing unpredictable disruptions in our supply chain, such
as factory closures driven by the COVID-19 crisis and raw material sourcing issues. We can also upgrade
the technology of our product lines with minimal business disruption because of our ability to temporarily
reallocate production across facilities. This also facilitates the sharing of manufacturing best practices,
which enables us to realize production efficiencies and optimize our cost base across the plant network.
Our deep engineering expertise also allows us to redeploy existing machines to support our expansion
into new geographies while limiting capital expenditure and operating costs. For instance, when we
opened our production facilities in Algeria and Australia, we were able to redeploy machines from other
production facilities.

Last but not least, we are able to manage a high level of complexity, demonstrated by our wide range of
stock keeping units, or SKUs, which involve different sizes, concepts and absorption levels. We offer a
high level of product differentiation while leveraging common product platforms across our customers,
thereby leveraging the scale of our R&D investments. We are also working continuously to improve how
we manage the increased complexity inherent to a growing and dynamic product range.

**_R&D capabilities enabling us to deliver a steady stream of innovations_**

Our ability to deliver product innovations is illustrated by an average of 30 innovations (requiring
technology developments and including product upgrades, new features and range extensions) delivered
for our customers each year since 2017. Many of the product technologies underlying our product
platforms can be adapted across multiple geographies and product segments (such as baby diapers,
Adult Incontinence products, and Feminine Care fluff towels) to meet varying market-specific consumer
preferences at an efficient cost.

Our ability to deliver a steady stream of innovations is underpinned by our continuous investments as
well as the unique organization of our R&D infrastructure and team, encompassing more than 100
employees. Our R&D function is primarily conducted through four centers of excellence across Belgium
and Germany and three R&D hubs located in Italy, Brazil and Mexico. As we are committed to applying
the highest scientific and quality standards, our unique innovation capabilities are strengthened by stateof-the-art laboratories, test stands for core development, dedicated full diaper pilot production lines, and
an in-house engineering department designing and building our proprietary manufacturing equipment.


-----

We believe that the strength of our R&D department is directly attributable to this unique research
infrastructure as well as its close integration with manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, we
continuously seek to enhance our R&D capabilities through extensive collaboration with external
laboratories, and partnerships with leading research institutes and start-ups.

We also believe that the strength of our R&D capabilities and deep innovation pipeline is due in part to
our proximity to our different types of clients, which provides us with valuable insights into what
consumers want and how their needs evolve. We use these customer insights to feed our internal
innovation cascade; for example, working closely with retailers that want their brands to be reliable
alternatives to international A-brands obliges us to follow the latest technological advancements in the
market and master the ability to replicate them swiftly, both for our retailer brand customers and for our
own brands. The channel diaper technology, as an example, was initially developed for a retailer brand
client in Europe before being rolled out globally, including through our brand Canbebe in Turkey. Like our
retailer customers, we also create synergies between our third-party brand business and our retailer
brands and own brands. Third-party brands are trendsetters and, by working closely with them, we remain
on top of the innovation agenda and use this experience to feed innovation to other products. In that
sense, we play a key role in democratizing great innovations and making them available across our
product portfolio. For instance, to develop our offer in terms of sustainability, we have worked with different
third-party brands on organic cotton tampons that are now being launched across our retailer brands.

Our strong track record of delivering innovation over recent years includes: (i) channel technology in
diapers, launched in Europe in 2017 and then rolled out to other geographies, including the Middle East
and Africa in 2019, Brazil in 2019-2020 and the U.S. in 2020; (ii) adult pants “discreet-core” platform (both
lycra and elasticated film types) launched in Europe in 2017, with lycra type products introduced to Brazil
in 2020; (iii) organic tampons launched in 2018; (iv) lycra baby pants with channels, launched in Europe
in 2019 and then introduced to other geographies such as Pakistan and Mexico in 2021; (v) channel
technology in feminine hygiene products, launched in Europe in 2019 and then applied to other
geographies such as the US in 2021; (vi) heavy flow towels launched in Mexico in 2020; and (vii) Feminine
Care towels launched in Pakistan in 2021.

This accelerated pace innovation is set to continue over the coming months. Selected examples of
upcoming innovations include:

  - Baby Care segment: introduction of a new core platform on the European retail market, which is
a new generation of diapers incorporating improved absorption characteristics;

  - Adult Incontinence segment: a new generation of adult pants with channels; Orizon (for
European nursing homes), which are connected diapers able to monitor wetness and the body
posture of patients, sending real-time alerts to caregivers;

  - Feminine Care segment: ultra-absorbent pad with 100% organic cotton top sheet for US
third-party brand;

  - Packaging innovations: sustainable packaging solutions, using alternative and recycled content;

   - Sustainability Initiatives (pilot programs): circular solutions and services addressing the waste
impact of our products, including several pilot initiatives in the field of recycling and composting.

**_Invigorated management team supported by reputable and experienced board of directors_**

We believe that our management team possesses a unique blend of operational expertise developed
through longstanding service with Ontex and newly introduced brand and commercial experience needed
to drive the implementation of our strategic initiatives. Members of our Executive Management Team
possess an average of over five years of experience with Ontex, and 21 years in the retail consumer
goods industry.

The longstanding operational experience of our Executive Management Team is complemented by the
consumer expertise and commercial capabilities of several recently hired new members. Our new chief
executive officer, Esther Berrozpe, was appointed in January 2021 and brings over 25 years of experience
in the consumer goods sector, including in senior roles with blue chip companies in Europe and the US.
We also recently hired our new chief financial officer, Peter Vanneste, whose strategic mindset and
thought leadership, combined with his broad experience and knowledge of global consumer industries,
will be key assets to restore our profitable growth. Additionally, in May 2021 we appointed Vincent Crepy
as our chief supply chain officer, a newly created position intended to closely manage our supply chain


-----

end-to-end, drive a step change in our customer service level and maximize operational efficiencies.
Mr. Crepy’s wealth of international experience in consumer goods, in-depth knowledge of the supply
chain and experience in transformation projects to drive operational excellence and performance
improvement will be a catalyst to transforming our manufacturing and distribution networks and to
strengthening our global procurement function. Finally, in January 2021 we appointed Laurent Nielly as
President of our Europe division. Since joining Ontex in 2017, Mr. Nielly has transformed the Company’s
operations in the face of many challenges and will play a key role moving forward in returning our Europe
segment to profitable growth. The remaining members of our Executive Management Committee—
Armando Amselem (President, AMEAA division; with Ontex since 2016), Astrid De Lathauwer (EVP,
Human Resources; with Ontex since 2014); Annick De Poorter (EVP, R&D and Sustainability; with Ontex
since 2003) and Jonas Deroo (EVP Legal and General Secretary; with Ontex since 2015)—bring decades
of experience and deep expertise in their respective fields that we believe will be crucial to implementing
our strategic transformation. See “Management—The Issuer—Executive Management Team”.

Our dynamic management team is complemented by a strong board of directors possessing a wide
variety of skills and deep expertise in relevant fields and industries. The members of our board possess
an average of 32 years of experience, and a majority have experience and skills in the consumer goods
and retail industries. See “Management—The Issuer—Directors”.

**Our Strategies**

**_Introduction_**

Ontex enjoys a leading position in the personal hygiene market across our three core categories and the
geographies where we operate. Our strategic positioning, extensive industrial footprint and recognized
expertise allow us to benefit from the continued structural growth in demand for our products, driven by
positive socio-demographic and adoption trends and shifts in consumer behavior.

We have a unique business model that is based on three elements: proximity, flexibility and affordability.
We are close to our customers and consumers, and are able to leverage flexibility in operations in order
to deliver winning solutions in an affordable way. This model has been the key driver of our success in the
past, and we believe that it can be reinvigorated through the launch of new strategic initiatives aimed at
restoring growth, improving profitability, stepping up cash generation and building a future-proof business
model. We believe we will achieve these goals by following six strategic pillars:

   - Focusing more sharply on our portfolio, via simplification of businesses and products;

   - Enhancing customer-centricity, with a strengthening of customer relations leading to a return to
growth;

  - Accelerating the cadence of product innovation;

   - Restoring our operational excellence via improvement of cost competitiveness and service levels;

  - Transforming our organization and culture by driving individual accountability and performance,
while reviewing our structure to improve speed to market; and

   - Setting clear long-term environmental and social objectives.

We expect the turnaround of our business to be realized over coming years. We have prepared a strategic
agenda, which is outlined in the following paragraphs, organized around three main themes: (i) a new
culture, (ii) a focused portfolio, and (iii) a reinforced value-creation model.

**_New Culture_**

_Roll Out New Organizational Model and Performance Culture_

Since the beginning of 2021, we have been developing a new organizational model, structured around:
(i) Commercial Divisions, including a new Europe Division (resulting from the merger of our current
Europe and Healthcare divisions) and AMEAA Division (overseeing our operations in North America,
Brazil, Mexico, the Middle East, Africa and Asia); (ii) Operational Functions, including a supply chain and
an R&D division and (iii) Supporting Functions, including our Finance & Technology, HR and Legal
divisions. Our organization has also been renewed with new arrivals, notably and most recently of our
CFO, Peter Vanneste, in May 2021.


-----

We expect these changes to strengthen our performance based on the above-mentioned three elements:

  - Proximity: the development of a de-layered commercial organization will bring us closer to
consumers (with senior sales leaders closer to our customers than previously). In Europe,
proximity will also be reinforced by an omni-channel approach and less duplication of functions. In
addition, our two geographical divisions will be accountable for all channels in a geography—
instead of our previous structure comprising three divisions that mixed geographies and channels,
with no single ownership across channels—which will bring us closer to customers;

   - Flexibility: consolidating the internal ownership of our products and innovation, instead of the
existing delegation of product portfolio ownership locally, is expected to drive scale while still
allowing for flexibility to meet local requirements; and

   - Affordability: implementation of end-to-end productivity targets with single points of
accountability for total delivered cost, service, quality, and safety, in contrast to the current
approach which siloed these functions. We expect this new organizational model to streamline the
organization, resulting in a lower cost structure.

In addition, we aim to create a new winning, performance-driven culture cemented in a new incentivization
and remuneration policy aligned with shareholders’ interests. Our objective is to clearly cascade
ownership and accountability on key goals, which should increase the speed of decision-making. Our
performance management system will be reinforced by several measures (including target setting,
monitoring of performance, feedback, etc.), and a culture emphasizing results over effort. Transparency
in the disclosure of performance targets will be a key element in the success of our project.

**_Focused Portfolio_**

Over the past several months we conducted a comprehensive review of our portfolio in order to maximize
value from our businesses and brands. As a result, we have identified clear priorities: (i) turnaround
Europe retailer brands, (ii) outperform in North America, (iii) grow our brands in selected emerging
markets, (iv) accelerate growth in our Adult Incontinence segment globally and (v) divest certain noncore assets.

_Turnaround Europe Retailer Brands_

Ontex enjoys a strong leadership position in the retailer brands segment in Europe, which is a promising
and growing market, in particular given the expected further increase of the value share of retailer brands
within the overall market and favorable demographic trends, especially in relation to adult incontinence
products. Nevertheless, more recently we have been underperforming in this segment, with our net sales
decreasing between 2017 and 2021 at a like-for-like CAGR of -5%. Our goal is to reverse this trend and
to achieve growth in the European retailer brands segment over the period from 2021 to 2023, by
(i) capturing profitable growth in fast-growing product segments, channels and customers and
(ii) regaining contracts by re-establishing our position as the #1 partner of choice.

In particular, we aim to reposition ourselves in identified areas of expected profitable growth, by
(i) capturing our fair share of baby pants and ecological credentials growth, (ii) outperforming in Adult
Incontinence growth, especially in pants and light incontinence products, (iii) improving our Feminine
Care profitability through innovation and better mix management, and (iv) a step-change in our online
presence, supporting omni-channel strategies and stepping up our presence in Pure Plays.

In order to regain contracts, we intend to restore our position as the preferred partner of European
retailers by rebuilding trustworthy relationships. Our levers to achieve this strategy consist notably of:

  - Customer centricity: performing customer segmentation in order to “win with the winners”, by
bringing sales leadership closer to customers across all functions;

  - Excellence on basics: promoting a level of excellence in services, quality and innovation, with
accelerated innovation cascade and strengthened portfolio management capabilities; and

  - Cost and price competitiveness: optimizing operations and implementing selected pricing
investments based on customer segmentation.

Preliminary measures are already starting to show results, with recent contract gains in 2021 and no
contracts lost since the beginning of the year, resulting in an expected return to net sales growth in the
retailer brands segment later in the year.


-----

_Outperform in North America_

The United States hygiene market is the second-largest personal care market worldwide (representing
€13.2 billion in 2020) with attractive growth rates overall (+2.5% CAGR over 2015 to 2020) and in
particular in the adult incontinence segment (+6.5% CAGR over the same period). Future prospects are
also positive, especially for Ontex, since we intend to leverage on specific trends that will enable us to
outperform the total market, with the aim of continuing to grow our net sales in North America over the
period from 2020 to 2023. These trends and our strategy to capitalize on each one of them consist of:

  - Retailer brands still have significant headroom for growth in North America, given their lower
_relative penetration compared to the European market. We aim to become the go-to partner for_
consumer-driven retailer brands, scaling up our existing strong positions with selected customers.
In addition, we can rely on our already strong position in retailer brands in Europe, where we are
the undisputed number one player, in order to support our strategy in North America;

   - Third-party brands represent the fastest growth niche in the North American market. We intend to
further expand our strongholds in this segment, leveraging on our current position as the number
one partner of third-party “lifestyle” brand owners, thanks to our solid relationships with them in
Baby Care and Feminine Care;

   - Strong healthcare distributors (driven by their own private labels) are gaining market share in the
_fragmented US healthcare segment (in which participants are not the same as in retail). We intend_
to position ourselves as a trusted expert partner for incontinence, building a strong competitive
position in the US adult incontinence market which is still underplayed by Ontex.

We believe we can achieve these objectives in part by leveraging our existing strengths, such as (i) our
category and retailer brand expertise built in Europe, (ii) our commercial relationships with leading retailer
and third-party brands in North America and (iii) our Mexican business, which would allow us to further
leverage scale on procurement, operations and R&D in the region.

Furthermore, we intend to realize targeted investments in order to unlock our growth plans, with focuses
on:

  - Reinforcement of US production: bringing more agility to our operations while focusing on
increasing cost-competitiveness and adding production capacity (including our new North Carolina
factory which is expected to ramp up production in the first half of 2022), including new Baby Care
production lines and the integration of our Feminine Care production assets;

  - Revamp of product and innovation capabilities: improving speed-to-market focused on US
consumer needs, via new product developments and deployment of an innovation “incubator”
model; and

   - Strengthening of commercial capabilities: strengthening commercial teams to increase customer
proximity and intimacy, in particular with third-party brands and retailer brands, enabling us to gain
more granular consumer and shopper insights.

_Grow Our Brands in Selected Emerging Markets_

Today, Ontex holds strong leading positions in selected emerging markets, in both adult incontinence (#1
in Turkey, #2 in Mexico and Brazil) and baby care (#1 in Ethiopia, #2 in Pakistan, Algeria and Mexico). We
can consequently take full advantage of the positive underlying socio-demographic trends, including an
aging population in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and Asia, collectively representing 90% of
global growth in the population over 45, and positive birthrate trends in the Middle East and Africa.
Besides profiting from demographics, we believe we can also benefit from the anticipated increase in
product utilization. Indeed, usage of the products we produce remains significantly lower than in
developed markets (2.5x lower in feminine care, 5x in baby care, 10x in adult incontinence) and our
affordable brands put us in prime position to profit from increasing access to the market and utilization
rates.

Our strategy for these geographies consists of driving profitable growth in existing regions, notably by
growing our brands in selected countries. In order to reach this objective, we intend to take specific
actions including (i) disciplined investments in distribution, pricing, mix and innovation, (ii) support of our
customers in retailer brand development, and (iii) further standardization of our products and brands
across platforms, to benefit from scale advantages.


-----

In addition, we will adopt a more disciplined and focused approach in assessing our exposure to emerging
markets, based on selective criteria and oriented towards value creation. Our key geographies should be
under-served markets, providing us with a right-to-win with strong local trusted brands. They should also
leverage and contribute to global scale, without increasing complexity. Moreover, we will work on mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by maintaining a more balanced exposure between
developed and emerging market currencies. Finally, for further eventual geographical expansion, we will
rely on our scale-up model that starts with leveraging our existing positions as hubs for exports (for
instance, in Puebla, Mexico, and Istanbul, Turkey) and building sizeable business, before considering
establishing local sales forces and launching local operations. Our strategy for further expansion would
therefore be based on a very selective approach, enabling us to keep a lean cost structure through
centralized operations and avoiding significant investments.

_Accelerate Adult Incontinence Globally_

Adult incontinence products represent a fast-growing market (comprising €16 billion globally in 2020, and
demonstrating revenue growth of +6.1% CAGR from 2015 to 2020) in which Ontex is a leading player,
with a strong right-to-win and revenues of €679.5 million in 2020. The company has the number one
position among retailer brands in Europe, a close third position in expert brands in European healthcare
(especially in institutions and home delivery channels), and first or second positions in selected emerging
countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Turkey with our multi-channel approach (retail and pharma). This is
the result of strong competitive advantages expected to continue to drive growth in the future: expertise
and proximity with consumers, a full product range and available capacity, innovative products and
services, cost-competitiveness through operational efficiencies and an omni-channel go-to-market
approach.

However, we have not been able to capture our fair share of the market growth over the past few years.
Accelerating in this category should thus enable us to benefit from the market opportunities and align our
net sales growth with the market growth trends. To that extent, Ontex has implemented a strategic plan
with clear objectives for each geography in which we operate:

  - Europe: protect leadership positions in retailer brands (notably by protecting our fair share,
especially in adult pants and light incontinence, while supporting further market share gains in the
retailer brand segment in general) and scale up in healthcare (notably by strengthening the “expert
brands” positioning and expanding into continence care services);

  - North America: establish a position in the retail channel through partner brands (retailer brands
and third-party brands), and scale-up our position in the healthcare channel by partnering with
selected distributors;

  - Emerging markets: regain and/or protect our number one positions in selected markets (Mexico,
Turkey, Brazil) by accelerating pants and light incontinence product growth while protecting our
strong position in heavy incontinence, and by leveraging leading positions to further expand
regionally following our disciplined profitable expansion model.

_Divest Certain Non-Core Assets_

As part of the broad strategic reevaluation of our portfolio undertaken over the past several months, we
have reviewed our global footprint and are actively considering the best options to create value for the
Group, including exiting from certain geographies, lines of business and sales channels that do not form
a core part of our renewed focus. We may, as a result of this strategic review, divest certain assets or exit
specific regions in favor of markets where we see more favorable trends, more stable economic
conditions, or where we feel we can better leverage our existing business to support our growth model. In
line with our current financial strategy, we would expect to apply the proceeds from material asset sales
to repay a portion of our existing indebtedness.

**_Reinforced Value Creation Model_**

_Deliver Flexibility at Best Cost_

From an operational standpoint, Ontex has clear strengths it can build on, including a global
manufacturing and R&D footprint, significant scale, a wide range of production equipment, operational
excellence and technical know-how. However, these strengths have not been working in full


-----

synchronization, which we have addressed by creating the new supply chain function, with full end-toend responsibility designed to break functional silos.

We have established a clear vision for our operations: deliver flexibility at best cost. To achieve this
objective, we have articulated a roadmap around 4 goals, each one defined by priorities and measured by
key metrics: (i) putting consumer and customer first; (ii) becoming more agile; (iii) turning leaner and
more scalable; (iv) developing a virtuous mindset.

First and foremost, the shift from an “operations first” model to a “consumer and customer first” mindset
is one of our key priorities and translates into the way we work through our quality standards and service
levels, and our operational priorities. These will be driven increasingly by consumer satisfaction metrics,
which we will start to track with closer attention.

Secondly, we believe that agility in delivering innovation comes with simple, flexible, and pragmatic
processes, with mastery of the technology and smart complexity management. We are currently focused
on improving these execution capabilities through measures such as the phasing-out of old product
platforms and rollout specifications and process development.

Thirdly, on a cost and cash management perspective, we plan to shift from an opportunistic model to a
strategic model, breaking functional silos as described above and focusing on net cost savings instead of
gross cost savings only. In addition, we will focus on optimizing capacity and better allocating our capital.

Finally, from a cultural standpoint, we will focus on building a results-based collaboration between our
dedicated teams, enabled by simple and focused organization and processes, alignment of incentives
across functions, and definition of clear accountabilities and expectations. Our goal is ultimately to build
trust and respect among our employees, while increasing their performance thanks to more objective
evaluations based on clear KPIs and less diluted responsibilities.

All of the above will allow us to deliver flexibility at best cost, resulting in expected year-over-year
productivity gains of more than 2% thanks to very specific and concrete initiatives organized around four
areas: (i) procurement (e.g. further leveraging our scale and stepping up our capabilities, tools and
processes), (ii) design to value (e.g. never compromising on quality and harmonizing raw materials),
(iii) manufacturing (e.g. increasing asset utilization and optimizing our maintenance) and (iv) supply chain
(e.g. increasing truck fill-rate and improving our warehouse management).

_Maximize Value Creation Through Innovation_

Innovation is deeply rooted in our DNA, developed by specialists based in our worldwide centers of
excellence and R&D hubs. Over the past 18 years, we have launched 150 new innovations. Indeed, as an
international producer of both retailer and our own Ontex brands, product innovation has proven essential
to our success. We have chosen to constantly invest in our R&D capabilities to further develop our
product portfolio by delivering a steady stream of innovations, and to maintain our leadership position by
creating value jointly with customers.

As a result, our engineers reinvent and design innovative solutions that can easily travel across our global
“technology park”. Our dedicated pilot lines also allow our R&D teams to test new innovations with zero
impact on current operations. As a consequence, we currently have a strong innovation pipeline to
support our growth strategies. Selected products which have been recently launched or will be launched
shortly include:

   - A new generation of diapers, with an ultra-light and ultra-absorbent core, inspired by the Asian
hygiene market;

  - A new generation of disposable adult pants to capture the category’s rapid growth by leveraging
both our expertise in channel core technology and our patented instant dryness system; and

  - Smart premium absorbent slips using integrated sensor technology to monitor the wetness and
body posture, able to provide home care staff with accurate real-time information on mobile or
web app.

In order to reinforce this virtuous cycle of new product and value creation through innovation, and to
leverage R&D synergies for our different businesses, we have simplified our organizational structure,
making it leaner and more sharply focused on fewer projects, in order to enhance agility and speed-tomarket in key areas when it comes to innovation.


-----

_Generate New Value Streams Through Sustainability_

In 2019, we updated our sustainability strategy to ensure that we continue to make a positive difference,
both for our stakeholders and ultimately to the planet. Since then, with the support of different sector
associations, we have been working towards our 2030 goals and evaluating organizations, while stepping
up our social agenda built around diversity, inclusion and the resolute purpose of serving every group of
the population with our affordable and high-quality product offering.

Our sustainability ambitions can be articulated around four pillars: (i) to move towards a circular business
model; (ii) to create a positive impact in our supply chain with the regeneration of natural resources; (iii) to
achieve climate-neutral operations; and (iv) to build trust through enhancing transparency and leading
the way to a fair society.

With regard to the first pillar in particular, we invest significant time and resources on research related to
circular solutions such as reusable products (for example, our hybrid diaper concept), recycling and
composting of the used products. In addition, we are redeveloping the composition of our diapers, using
materials of natural and renewable origin, and launching packaging with significant amounts of recycled
content as well as paper bags.

Innovation across the complete lifecycle of our products—from sourcing sustainable materials to
minimizing the end-of-life impact—is key to achieving our sustainability ambitions.

**_Continued focus on proactive deleveraging_**

In addition to the strategic initiatives described above, we intend to continue pursuing a sound financial
policy aimed at reducing the Group’s overall indebtedness and financial leverage. We believe that certain
of our turnaround policies are already showing results, and that the continued implementation of our
strategic overhaul will support our deleveraging in coming years. As part of this plan we intend to more
proactively manage our cash and our costs, with a focus on optimizing capacity and better allocating our
capital. We also aim to focus our capital expenditures on initiatives that we believe will have the biggest
impact on our business, with the ultimate aim of normalizing our capital expenditures at a lower run-rate
level than in recent years.

Finally, we aim to continue our deleveraging through the proactive reduction of the Group’s indebtedness.
In 2020, as a precautionary measure due to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic, we drew down the full €300.0 million available under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to
provide us with financial flexibility. In the first quarter of 2020 we repaid €210.0 million in principal amount
thereunder, and in May of 2021 we paid down a further €60.0 million. In connection with the transactions
we intend to repay the remaining €30.0 million outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
and the Transactions are expected to result in a net reduction to our financial indebtedness of
€40.0 million. Additionally, in line with our current financial strategy, we would expect to apply the proceeds
from material asset sales to repay a portion of our existing indebtedness.

**The Transactions**

In connection with the Offering, on June 23, 2021 we entered into the New Syndicated Facilities
Agreement, under which will be made available the New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities
_Agreement”._

We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with the gross proceeds raised from
borrowings under the New Term Loan Facility in an amount of €220 million, (i) to repay in full the amounts
outstanding and cancel the commitments under the Existing Bilateral Facility, the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Term Loan Facility, (ii) to pay the fees and expenses related to the
Transactions and (iii) for general corporate purposes.

The Offering, the entry into the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the drawing of €220 million under
the New Term Loan Facility and the use of proceeds therefrom and from the Offering in the manner
described above and under “Use of Proceeds” are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions”.

**Financial Outlook and Targets**

**_Full-Year 2021 Outlook_**

_The below information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational_
_results for the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2021. The statements and figures contained_


-----

_herein were prepared based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent_
_uncertainties and subject to change. Accordingly, our actual results for the three and six-month periods_
_ending June 30, 2021 may vary from our preliminary estimates below, and such variations could be_
_material. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain_
_of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._

We currently expect stable full-year revenue on a like-for-like basis, with revenue growth beginning in the
second quarter and the first benefits of selective pricing investments in Europe and retailer brand contract
wins in Europe and North America expected later in 2021. We are observing short-term pressure on
margins due to the expected effects of significant increases and continued volatility in commodity prices
translating into peak raw material costs. Despite strong initial results from cost-saving programs (with
which we target net savings of approximately €60 million in 2021) and other initiatives intended to mitigate
a portion of our cost inflation, which helped to partially offset these effects, we expect our Adjusted
EBITDA margin for the second quarter of 2021 to be slightly below that of the first quarter of 2021. The
implementation of strategic decisions is expected to result in non-recurring expenses of approximately
€55 million, to be recorded in 2021 (including €40 million in connection with our cost saving initiatives).

**_Financial Targets_**

_The discussion of targets set forth below includes forward-looking statements that have been prepared_
_by, and are the responsibility of, the Group’s management and represent, to the best of management’s_
_knowledge and opinion, the Group’s intended course of action. They are based on management’s current_
_beliefs, expectations, assumptions and business plan and involve known and unknown risks and_
_uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Group’s control, that could cause actual results,_
_performance or events to differ materially from the trends and targets described. No assurance can be_
_given that the trends and targets described below will occur, continue or be achieved. These forward-_
_looking statements involve assessments about matters that are inherently uncertain and actual results_
_may differ for a variety of reasons including those described in “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk_
_Factors” elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. No assurance can be given that actual results will_
_track those described in the forward-looking statements below._

_Furthermore, the targets presented below do not constitute forecast data or estimates of consolidated_
_profit, but instead are based on the Group’s strategic goals and action plans and are the responsibility of_
_the Group’s management. The targets are based on data, assumptions and estimates that the Group_
_considers to be reasonable. These data, assumptions and estimates may change over time or be modified_
_due to uncertainties related to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment as well as_
_other factors. Moreover, the achievement by the Group of the targets presented below implies the success_
_of the Group’s strategy. In addition, if any of the risks described under “Risk Factors” beginning on_
_page 16 of this Offering Memorandum were to actually occur, they could have an impact on the Group’s_
_business, results of operations, financial position and/or outlook, and could therefore jeopardize its ability_
_to achieve the targets presented below. The Group cannot give any assurance or guarantee that it will_
_achieve its targets described in this section. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the information below_
_when evaluating an investment decision in the Notes._

On June 21, 2021, the Group confirmed its ambition of returning to growth in 2021, with the aim of
achieving like-for-like revenue growth of between 2% to 3% and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of between
12.5% to 13.5%, and to continue deleveraging to meet a targeted debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of below
3.0x, by the end of 2023.

These targets are based on the Group’s strategic agenda, including cost and cash management initiatives
aimed at achieving €120 million in net cost savings by the end of 2023 (including the €60 million of net
savings expected in 2021 as described in "—Full-Year 2021 Outlook" above). Of this, overhead resizing
is targeted to contribute approximately €20 million in cost savings through 2022, the result of a reduction
in the number of the Group’s functional divisions and related actions intended to streamline its
organizational structure as further described above in “—Our Strategies”.

In addition to cost savings, the Group intends to take a disciplined approach to managing its working
capital. In particular, the Group aims to normalize its level of capital expenditures, targeting a run-rate of
approximately 4% of revenue, down from an elevated level of 5% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

The Group is implementing a combination of efficiency initiatives targeting operational productivity gains
(including an improvement in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of ten percentage points and a


-----

one-percentage point reduction in waste) and a reduction in overhead costs to pre-2016 levels, which
together, if achieved, it believes will result in a significant positive impact to the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA
margin. It is anticipated that a portion of this margin growth will be re-invested into the growth of the
Group’s business. The Group expects to incur non-recurring costs totaling approximately €60 million in
connection with these efficiency initiatives through 2023, with €40 million expected to be recognized in
2021.

From a revenue perspective, the Group targets overall organic (like-for-like) growth of 2% to 3% per year
by the end of 2023 through the growth initiatives discussed above in “—Our Strategies—Focused
_Portfolio”, including low single-digit like-for-like growth in its Europe division and mid single-digit_
like-for-like growth in its AMEAA division.

Euronext Brussels (ISIN: BE0974276082). See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions”. The shareholder
structure shown above is based on the most recent notifications made under the Belgian law of 2 May 2007 on the disclosure
of significant shareholdings in issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and containing various
provisions, implementing in Belgian law Directive 2004/109/EC (situation as at May 25, 2021). The Issuer is a holding company
that has no revenue-generating operations of its own and will depend on cash from our operating companies to be able to
make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—The
_Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no or limited revenue-generating operations of their_
_own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or the_
_Guarantees”._

(2) The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior obligations. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (collectively,
the “Guarantees”) by the Guarantors. The Guarantees will be unsecured. The Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual
and legal limitations under applicable laws, may be limited to the maximum amount payable by such Guarantor without
violating any laws related to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under
value, or similar corporate laws applicable to each of the Guarantors, or its governing body, in its jurisdiction of incorporation
and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of Notes—The Guarantees”._

(3) On June 23, 2021, the Issuer, among others, entered into the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement to provide for a eurodenominated senior term loan facility in an amount of €220,000,000 and a euro-denominated senior revolving facility in an
amount of up to €250,000,000. The New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Issuer
and the Guarantors on an unsecured basis, and pari passu in right of payment with the Notes. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities Agreement”. The Revolving Credit Facility will remain undrawn as of_
the Issue Date.

(4) The entities in the Restricted Group will be subject to the covenants in the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities Agreement” and “Description of
_the Notes”._


-----

(5) As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted for 79% of the consolidated
total assets, 76% of the consolidated revenue and 96% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group.

(6) As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis to reflect the Transactions, the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors
would have had total third-party funded indebtedness of €66.2 million (excluding lease liabilities of €43.4 million), as well as
trade payables and tax liabilities, to which the Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated.

_insolvency laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable_
_to you as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you_

_fraudulent conveyance or corporate assistance statutes, may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations_

**Optional Redemption . . . . . .** At any time prior to July 15, 2023 the Issuer may redeem all or a

See “Use of Proceeds”.

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect
to the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for


-----

taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. If
the Issuer or the Guarantors is or are required by law to withhold
or deduct for such taxes with respect to a payment to the holders
of Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by
the holders of Notes after the withholding is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes”._

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event of certain developments affecting taxation which
would require the Issuer or a guarantor of the Notes, if any, to pay
additional amounts, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole,
but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”._

**Change of Control** . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a
change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the date of purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Change
_of Control”._

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain

                        - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

qualifications. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Certain_

shelf registration statement with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have


-----

advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they
are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue marketmaking at any time without notice. Accordingly, there is no
assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**
**AND OTHER DATA**

The summary financial information presented below is taken from (i) the Issuer’s audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, prepared in
accordance with IFRS, and (ii) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019
and 2020 were subject to an audit by PwC Bedrijfsrevisoren BV / PwC Reviseurs d’Entreprises SRL, the
Issuer’s statutory auditors for those years.

The summary financial information presented below also includes unaudited consolidated financial
information for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021. This financial data is unaudited and has been
calculated by adding (i) the audited consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31,
2020 and (ii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and then subtracting (iii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. The unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months
ended March 31, 2021 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not
prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by our
independent auditors. The unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months ended
March 31, 2021 presented herein is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited consolidated financial information for the
12 months ended March 31, 2021 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any
future period and should not be used as the basis for, or prediction of, an annualized calculation.

Except as otherwise expressly identified herein, financial information presented for the year ended
December 31, 2018 in this Offering Memorandum has not been adjusted for the retrospective application
of IFRS 16.

Consistent with the Issuer’s public reporting obligations, the terms of the Indenture will require that the
Issuer furnish financial statements to holders of the Notes on a semi-annual basis. The unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer and the financial information for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 presented herein are provided solely for convenience
purposes in connection with this Offering, and the Issuer will not be furnishing quarterly financial
statements on an ongoing basis following the completion of this Offering.

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information on an as adjusted basis to give
pro forma effect to the Transactions, including financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the
Transactions on the indebtedness of the Group as if the Transactions had occurred as of March 31,
2021. The as adjusted financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not
represent what the actual indebtedness of the Group would have been had the Transactions occurred on
March 31, 2021; nor does it purport to project our indebtedness at any future date. The as adjusted
financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of
the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments, nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected
for any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and
ratios that we report herein, such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin and free cash flow (each as defined in this Offering Memorandum) are not financial measures
defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using different


-----

methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance indicators and ratios are not
directly comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following_
_risks, together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether_
_to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could harm us. If these_
_events occur, the trading price of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay all or part of the_
_interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not_
_currently known to us or that are presently deemed immaterial may also harm us and affect your_
_investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ significantly from the results expressed or implied in such forward-looking_
_statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below. Please see_
_“Forward-Looking Statements”._

**Risks Relating to our Industry and our Business**

**_We cannot ensure that we will continue to have access to sufficient quantities of raw materials_**
**_and our results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in raw materials prices._**

We are dependent upon the availability of raw materials for the manufacture of our products. Raw
materials and packaging costs accounted for between 70% and 75% of our cost of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019. The key raw materials we use are
fluff, super-absorbers, non-woven fabrics and polyethylene film.

Despite a trend toward industry consolidation among suppliers of our raw materials, we seek to maintain
a diverse supplier base. Our top 10 suppliers accounted for 46% of total supplier spend in 2020 and,
aside from a single contract covering approximately 11%, no single supplier accounted for more than 5%
of total supplier spend. Nonetheless, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers will be able to supply
us with sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices in the future. Furthermore, if we were to
lose any of our suppliers, whether as a result of the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings,
decisions by suppliers to allocate raw materials to other purchasers or otherwise, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to replace any such suppliers or procure substitute raw materials in a
timely manner, on acceptable commercial terms, or at all.

Furthermore, the raw materials we use are subject to price volatility due to a number of factors that are
beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the availability of supply (including supplier capacity
constraints); general economic conditions; commodity price fluctuations (particularly of crude oil);
demand by other industries for the same raw materials; and the availability of complementary and
substitute materials. In particular, certain chemicals used in our raw materials, including polyethylene,
propylene and polypropylene (which is used in the production of non-woven fabrics), are derived from
crude oil. Accordingly, fluctuations in the price of crude oil may lead to volatility in our raw materials costs.
Furthermore, fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate may also cause volatility in our raw
materials costs, since we make purchases of fluff products in U.S. Dollars and since the reference
currency for crude oil is the U.S. Dollar. See “—We make substantial sales and purchases of raw materials
_in currencies other than Euros, which exposes us to risks resulting from exchange rate fluctuations”. In_
2020, a reduction in global commercial and industrial activity due to COVID-19 impacted the prices for
several of our primary raw materials, resulting in lower commodity index prices relative to prior periods.
The loosening of COVID-related restrictions and resulting rebound in economic activity, among other
things, subsequently caused prices to increase, and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum index
prices of our primary raw materials are higher than pre-pandemic levels. We generally purchase most of
our raw materials against an index which is based on the average price for the previous quarter.
Accordingly, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the cost of our raw materials does not yet fully
reflect the impact of the recent rise in commodity prices. We expect that our raw materials costs will
temporarily increase as the index prices for our purchases of raw materials reflect current higher
commodity prices, and we cannot assure that our raw materials costs will return to previous levels or that
they will not increase further in the future, which would adversely affect our results.

The majority of our customer contracts are based on fixed pricing models and do not contain raw materials
price indexation clauses. If we are unable to pass on increases in raw materials prices to our customers
in a timely manner, we may experience lower margins. We may also lose customers and/or revenue to the
extent our customers do not agree to price increases.


-----

We seek to reduce a portion of our exposure to raw material price volatility through arrangements with
our fluff suppliers that reduce our exposure to volatility in fluff prices as well as through hedging of
propylene, polypropylene and polyethylene. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to
hedge our exposure to volatility in raw material prices or that, where we plan to enter into a hedge, such
arrangements will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or will effectively
address the risks relating to fluctuations in raw material prices. Furthermore, while our fluff hedges
currently qualify for hedge accounting treatment, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be
the case. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do
not qualify for hedge accounting and the ineffective portion of an effective hedge will be recorded directly
on the income statement. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and ability to meet our profitability targets.

**_We make substantial sales and purchases of raw materials in currencies other than Euros, which_**
**_exposes us to risks resulting from exchange rate fluctuations._**

Although we prepare our financial statements in Euros, we make substantial sales and purchases of raw
materials in currencies other than Euros. In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended
December 31, 2020, we generated 54.1% and 52.7%, respectively, of our revenue in currencies other
than Euros, principally Mexican Pesos, Brazilian Reals, U.S. Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Polish Zloty,
Russian Roubles and Turkish Lira. A weakening of one or more of these currencies against the Euro
necessarily reduces our revenues. We also make purchases of certain raw materials, primarily fluff, in
U.S. Dollars. Fluff represented 17% and 18%, respectively, of our cost of raw materials (including
packaging) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.
Purchases of oil-based raw materials also indirectly increase our exposure to the U.S. Dollar, since the
reference price for crude oil is U.S. Dollars. Any strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, or
against any other currencies in which we generate revenues, would adversely affect our results of
operations. Furthermore, as we expand our operations our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements
and related risks will increase. For example, following our acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, we have
significant exposure to the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso, respectively, and in recent periods our
revenues have been impacted by adverse exchange movements in these currencies relative to the Euro.
Exchange rates have also recently become more volatile in certain other countries in which we operate,
such as Turkey and Russia.

We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in 2020 maturing at the latest in April 2022 in order
to limit volatility in our business resulting from exposures to sales in Pounds Sterling, Polish Zloty and
Australian Dollars as well as purchases in U.S. Dollars and Czech Crowns. Please see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative_
_Disclosure About Market Risk—Foreign Exchange Risk” for more information on our management of_
foreign exchange risk. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to hedge our exposure
to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with such forward contracts or that such forward contracts will
continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or will effectively address the risks
relating to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, while the terms of our foreign currency
forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of our forecasted transactions in the relevant
foreign currency, enabling us to apply hedge accounting, there can be no assurance that these contracts
will continue to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the ineffective portion of
an effective hedge will be recorded directly on the income statement.

Foreign exchange rate fluctuations can also affect the relative competitive position of our various
production facilities. Competitors that operate production facilities in different jurisdictions may benefit
from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, thereby causing our products to become less attractive. This
could particularly be the case for competitors with production facilities located outside the Eurozone,
since a significant portion of our production facilities are located inside the Eurozone. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and
ability to meet our profitability targets.

**_We may experience disruptions at our production facilities or, in extreme cases, our production_**
**_facilities may be shut down._**

We have 19 production facilities located across five continents. Should a disruption occur at one or more
of our production facilities, we could experience temporary shortfalls in production or an increase in our


-----

cost of sales or distribution expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In
the case of fire, flood, storms, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, we may be required
to shut down the affected production facilities and there can be no assurance that we would be able to
completely or partially utilize our other production facilities to compensate for or mitigate the effects of
any such shutdowns. Any disruptions at or shutdowns of our production facilities could compromise our
on-time delivery record and diminish our production capacity and thereby have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, following the outbreak and
spread of COVID-19 in early 2020, we undertook various precautionary measures in our facilities,
including in certain limited instances plant closures or reductions in capacity at certain facilities. While we
were successful in reallocating production capacity and there was no impact to customer deliveries as a
result of these measures, we cannot assure that we will always have the ability to redistribute our
production in order to meet customer needs in the event of unforeseen plant closures or capacity
reductions. Please also see “—A global pandemic (or any disease outbreak, including epidemics,
_pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could_
_have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial_
_position”._

**_We may be adversely affected by competition from branded product manufacturers and retailer_**
**_brand manufacturers._**

The categories in which we operate are mature and highly competitive, as a number of companies
compete for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of
the highly competitive environment in which we operate, as well as increasing retailer concentration, our
retailer customers, including online retailers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade
terms, resulting in either reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower-cost competitors. This
is particularly true in our Europe division, where our revenues have in recent years been adversely
impacted by new market entrants and related pricing pressures, which have contributed to contract losses
to competitors.

Competition in our segments is based upon brand perceptions, product performance and innovation,
customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively may be impacted by a number of factors,
including:

  - certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and
development and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do,
which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers;

   - our competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins,
which may enable them to offer aggressive retail discounts and other promotional incentives;

   - our competitors may be able to obtain exclusive distribution rights at particular retailers or favorable
in-store placement;

   - our retailers could reduce inventories, shift to different products, or require us to lower our prices to
retain shelf placement of our products; and

   - we may lose market share to other private label brands sold by retailer chains, or to value brands
sold by local and regional competitors, which, in each case, may be sold at lower prices than our
products.

We face competition from branded product manufacturers, who produce, promote and sell products
under their own names or brands. Pure branded product manufacturers may have greater financial
resources than we have. From time to time, they may increase their marketing and promotional activities
in order to preserve market share and pricing for their products. For example, during periods of adverse
economic conditions, branded product manufacturers may respond by introducing discounts on their
products, which would negatively affect our margins. We also compete with retailer brand manufacturers,
who primarily produce products on behalf of national and international retailers, who in turn promote and
sell the products under their own brands or labels. Price is often a key consideration in purchasing retailer
brand products and our retailer customers may lose market share to other retailers or brands whose
products are priced more competitively than theirs, which could in turn adversely impact our sales.

We also face competition from both branded product manufacturers and retailer brand manufacturers in
the area of product innovation. Rapid time to market for innovative products is key to our competitiveness,
both against branded products and against manufacturers’ retailer brand offerings. There can be no


-----

assurance that we will be able to launch innovative products in a timely or successful manner. There can
also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and license patents, trademarks and similar proprietary
rights from third parties in order to respond to the innovations of our competitors. If we are unable to
timely develop innovative products or are unable to obtain and license such proprietary rights, we may
lose market share. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and ability to meet our profitability targets.

**_If we are unable to maintain our on-time service delivery record, this could adversely affect our_**
**_ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers._**

Our ability to deliver our products on time is key to attracting new customers and retaining existing
customers. On-time delivery is particularly important to our large retailer customers. Our ability to deliver
products on time may be adversely affected by events or circumstances beyond our control, including,
but not limited to, catastrophic events causing the shutdown of one or more of our production facilities,
unforeseen increases in order volumes as a result of changes to the competitive landscape or otherwise,
the failure of third-party freight carriers to meet scheduled delivery times, any prolonged shortage of
freight capacity or other extended disruption of transport services or the failure of our IT platform. If we
are unable to maintain our on-time service delivery record, we may be unable to attract new customers or
retain existing customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

A crucial component of our ability to meet our customers’ on-time delivery requirements is our ability to
maintain a robust and resilient supply chain, both for the raw materials required to manufacture our
products and for the delivery of our finished products to customers. Any failure by our transportation and
logistics providers to ensure a steady supply of raw materials to our facilities or timely deliveries of our
products to customers, including as a result of labor disputes, significant changes in trade policy,
shortages or other inability to procure sufficient shipping capacity, disruption or outage of information
and data systems, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to
climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over
which we have no control, could interrupt our continuous product supply and, if not effectively managed
and remedied, could result in contract losses and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**_Adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products may damage our_**
**_reputation, increase our costs of operations or decrease demand for our products, and_**
**_increasingly stringent product safety regulations may subject us to significant costs and_**
**_liabilities._**

Product safety and the public’s perception that our products are safe and high-quality are essential to our
reputation and our business. We may be required to recall our products if they fail to meet our customers’
quality standards and/or the applicable health and safety standards of the country in which a product is
distributed, and we may be subject to product liability claims in connection with or independent of any
product recall. We may incur significant expenditures as a result of product recalls or product liability
claims. We may also suffer other commercial and financial consequences in connection with product
recalls or product liability claims, including fines and payments to customers in respect of destroyed
inventory, out-of-stock penalties and consumer complaints. Furthermore, if our products fail to meet our
customers’ specifications, the contracts governing such products may be terminated and we may not
have an opportunity to provide conforming products. Any product recall or product liability claim against
us could also subject us to adverse publicity which could harm our reputation and could ultimately
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Aside from legal obligations,
we are also subject to and must consider consumer perceptions of our products’ safety. Even if a claim
regarding our products is unsuccessful or unwarranted, or is not formally pursued, the negative publicity
surrounding such assertions could adversely impact our reputation and brand image and require
significant resources to restore our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

We are subject to medical device regulations in the markets in which we operate. Legislation concerning
medical devices has a tendency to become broader and stricter over time, and enforcement has tended
to increase. These regulations vary by jurisdiction and can change frequently, requiring continuous
adaptation of our operations and processes to maintain compliance with these varying regimes. We
cannot predict the amounts of any increases in capital expenditures or operating expenses that may be


-----

required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or whether these costs can be passed on to
customers through price increases. We expect that future changes to existing or new regulations may
affect our business and could lead to higher costs, or may result in adjustments to our business model.
Additionally, in the future we may introduce and manufacture products categorized in stricter regulatory
classes than the products we currently produce, which would subject us to increased regulation and
scrutiny by competent regulatory authorities. Non-compliance with such laws and regulations may give
rise to significant liability, including fines, damages, fees and expenses, and could restrict our access to
relevant markets. Any increase in our cost of regulatory compliance, as a result of more burdensome
regulations or the introduction of more highly regulated products, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, the medical nature of our products makes their manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage,
distribution, advertising and sale subject to extensive and increasing regulation. A number of our products
are regulated by health authorities in the E.U., the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and by consumer protection
organizations in these markets. These regulatory frameworks focus on our product ingredients, the overall
safety and efficacy of our products, and our marketing and advertising. These regulatory frameworks
exist at the supranational, national, state and local level in the markets where we sell our products. New
or more restrictive regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations, are likely and
could lead to additional compliance costs and could have an adverse impact on our business.

As a “convertor” of complex articles, we are at the end of a long supply chain beginning with our basic
raw materials, such as wood and oil derivates. We are required to demonstrate maximum transparency in
defining different substances and in identifying potential contaminants in our products, to ensure that our
products are always safe for end-consumers and compliant with relevant laws. The long, multi-stage
supply chain and the potential for cross-contamination of our product components makes it difficult to
guarantee the absence of certain trace chemicals in our products. Authorities have imposed greater
transparency obligations on substances used in these products and from time to time have restricted the
use of certain chemicals, which could impact future product developments by restricting the use of certain
raw materials or suppliers. Close cooperation with our global suppliers is key to managing these changing
regulatory requirements, and we cannot assure that we will be successful in doing so.

We rely on independent third-party certification to differentiate our products from others, and any failure
to maintain these third-party certifications could adversely affect consumers’ perceptions of our products’
safety and quality. For example, we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or
certification authorities in order to label our products as certified (e.g. organic, originating from sustainable
sources or the absence of certain chemicals) and we can lose our certifications if we use unapproved
raw materials, or incorrectly use a certification on product labels or in marketing materials. The loss of
any independent certification could adversely affect our market position and brand reputation as a maker
of clean, safe, or environmentally friendly products, and our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects could be adversely affected.

**_We may be subject to claims asserting the infringement of intellectual property rights and may be_**
**_unable to protect our own intellectual property rights._**

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop our own innovative products or to respond quickly
to the introduction of innovative products by branded product manufacturers and retailer brand
manufacturers. We have an internal intellectual property team which collaborates with various other
departments to ensure that our products and features are compliant with third party intellectual property
rights. Please see “Business—Intellectual Property” for more details of our intellectual property rights
and the approach we take to intellectual property. Our intellectual property team uses internal (access to
market databases) and external (intellectual property attorneys and consultants) resources to evaluate
innovations and developments from an intellectual property perspective at the start of each new project.
The team continues to discuss with our competitors the licensing of certain intellectual property rights in
relation to our products and technologies. From time to time, we are subject to claims by third parties
asserting the infringement of their intellectual property rights. While to date these claims have not been
material to our business, any such future claims could lead to litigation, which could be long and costly,
and the outcome of which may be uncertain. Furthermore, if we were required to obtain a license in
respect of the disputed rights, there can be no assurance that such license would be available on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any detrimental decision in patent infringement litigation, or our
inability to acquire intellectual property licenses on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

Additionally, we have obtained and applied for intellectual property rights in relation to our own products
and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional intellectual property rights, as appropriate. We
cannot guarantee, however, that any pending applications will be approved by applicable governmental
authorities and, even if approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the
registrations. Failure to secure pending applications may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property
rights that these applications were intended to cover. In addition, third parties may infringe our intellectual
property rights, thereby causing us to lose sales and requiring us to expend significant effort and
resources to pursue such parties, including through litigation, and limit or curtail such infringement. From
time to time, we pursue legal remedies against certain third parties who we believe have infringed our
intellectual property rights. We cannot guarantee that any such legal action will be successful in
preserving our intellectual property rights or in preventing unauthorized third-party use.

**_We may not be successful at retaining our key customers._**

Our top 10 customers by revenue accounted for 33% of our revenues for the year ended December 31,
2020. Our largest customer accounted for 5.9% of our revenues over the same period. While we believe
we benefit from a diversified customer base, in particular given our recent expansion into new markets,
we are nonetheless subject to regular renewals and competitive tender processes with these customers
which could result in contract losses that, individually or in the aggregate, could materially impact our
results.

We enter into framework agreements with the majority of our retail customers and distributors. These
agreements are generally on a non-exclusive basis and contain, in general, no minimum purchase
obligations. These agreements typically do not have a fixed term, and when they do, the term is generally
one to two years. Some of these agreements are automatically renewed or continue indefinitely, unless
either party terminates. As a result of the non-exclusive basis on which we contract with our customers,
as well as the competitive markets in which we operate, our key customers may have stronger bargaining
power and may use this leverage to demand higher discounts or allowances, which could adversely
impact our margins. In some cases, when we attempt to increase our prices, we may lose customers.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net contract losses (i.e. losses of customer contracts not
offset by renewals or new contract wins), particularly in our Europe division, contributed to the decline in
our consolidated revenues. Such contract losses can occur for a variety of reasons, including as a result
of our inability to meet a customer’s product, price or volume requirements, for instance if a competitor
offers a new, innovative product at a competitive price or a customer refuses to agree to price increases
required as a result of rising raw materials costs. If we lose one or more of our key customers, or if any
of our key customers demand higher discounts or allowances, this could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to realize the anticipated business growth opportunities, revenue benefits, cost_**
**_synergies, operational efficiencies and other benefits anticipated from, or may incur unanticipated_**
**_costs associated with, potential future acquisitions and divestitures._**

From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisitions that would complement our existing operations and
enable us to grow our business, or sales of existing assets or non-core lines of business no longer
consistent with our strategic direction. For example, in 2020 we acquired the US feminine hygiene assets
from Albaad Massuot Yitzhak Ltd. in Rockingham County to further develop our North American business.
As part of a broad strategic reevaluation of our portfolio, we are also actively considering options to
create value for the Group, including exiting from certain geographies, lines of business or sales channels
that do not form a core part of our renewed focus. See “Business—Strategies—Focused Portfolio—
_Divest Certain Non-Core Assets”. The success of any acquisition depends on our ability to integrate_
acquired businesses effectively. The integration of acquired businesses, or the spin-off and sale of
existing businesses or assets, may be complex and expensive and may present a number of risks and
challenges, including:

  - the diversion of management time, effort and attention from existing business operations;

  - the possible loss of key employees, customers or suppliers;

   - the unanticipated loss of revenue or increase in operating or other costs;

  - the challenge of developing an understanding of, and new technical skills with respect to, any
acquired business;


-----

   - the assumption of debt or other liabilities of an acquired business, including litigation related to
the acquired business;

  - the challenge of realizing a satisfactory purchase price for, and the potential assumption of
contingent liabilities and indemnification obligations in respect of, any divested assets or business;
and

  - expansion into new geographical markets, which may require us to cooperate with local partners
with whom we have not previously done business and may subject us to local regulations that may
be more onerous than the regulations to which we are subject in our existing geographic markets.

Integrating any acquired business or divesting existing assets may result in additional unforeseen
difficulties or liabilities and could impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
A divestiture of assets below book value would result in losses. While the Indenture will generally require
us to deploy cash proceeds from an asset disposal towards debt reduction or reinvestment into our
business, such requirements are subject to an extended timeline and significant qualifications and
exemptions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the anticipated
benefits of any future acquisitions or divestitures, including any expected business growth opportunities,
revenue benefits, cost savings or synergies and other operational efficiencies. Any of the foregoing or
other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_A global pandemic (or any disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar_**
**_widespread public health concerns such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial_**
**_position._**

Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease
outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions,
business closures or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large
gatherings or to self-quarantine, for example as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These
impacts include, but are not limited to:

   - significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products,
which may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase
our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in
demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower
priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity. If prolonged, such impacts can
further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our
results of operations and cash flows;

  - inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our
manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or
disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other
finished product components, transportation, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;

  - failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers,
distributors, contractors, commercial banks and external business partners, to meet their
obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their
own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or

   - significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute
our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or
regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing
facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or
otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing
operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of
our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.

Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors
beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as
third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.


-----

**_Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and_**
**_sales in international markets._**

We operate 19 production facilities and have 28 sales and marketing teams located across Europe,
Africa, the Americas and Asia & Oceania through which we make sales in more than 110 countries
worldwide. As a result, we are subject to economic, regulatory, political and other risks associated with
operating internationally. As we expand our operations in emerging and developing markets (including
the opening of a production plant in Ethiopia in 2017 for the manufacturing of baby diapers that are
specifically designed to meet the needs of African families), our exposure to these risks increases.
Therefore, our business may be adversely affected by economic, regulatory or political conditions or
instability in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate, including financial crises,
inflation or hyperinflation, currency devaluations, expatriation of cash, civil unrest, acts of terrorism,
wars, international conflicts, difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations (including in respect of
payments and receivables and intellectual property rights), difficulties in adopting or complying with or
changes in applicable local and international laws or regulations (including environmental laws and
regulations and permit and authorization regimes and as a result of new interpretations and more rigorous
enforcement, as well as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and
regulations), nationalization of property without fair compensation, corruption and extortion, and greater
and tighter government regulation on cross-border trading, production and pricing. Furthermore, many
emerging markets do not possess the full business, legal and regulatory infrastructure that would
generally exist in more mature free market economies. In addition, the taxation, currency and customs
legislation within such markets are subject to varying interpretations and changes, which can occur
frequently and unpredictably.

Following our recent expansion into Latin America, in particular through acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico,
we have significant exposure to these markets and our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially impacted by adverse political, social or economic developments in these
countries. In particular, we are subject to currency volatility in these countries, and in prior periods
significant weakening of the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso relative to the Euro have adversely
impacted our results. In addition, we derive a portion of our revenue from the Middle East and Africa,
regions in which we have made significant investments and are targeting for continued growth. In
particular, we currently operate facilities in Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan and Ethiopia and generate sales in
those countries and surrounding countries. During the past few years, there has been significant political
and social unrest across the Middle East and Africa and political systems across the region have been
and continue to be unstable. Furthermore, a deterioration of relations between any of these countries
and Western countries generally could indirectly affect our business.

As we are operating around the globe, we also need to ensure the personal safety of our employees in
production and other facilities and during travel to high-risk locations. If we are not able to safeguard our
employees, this may lead to reputational damage and difficulties in hiring people.

Any such conditions or instability could impact our operations and result in additional expenditure and
other commercial and financial impacts being incurred by us in order to comply with or adapt to such
conditions or instability and consequently this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in customer and end-consumer requirements may negatively impact our sales._**

Our ability to timely respond to changing customer and end-consumer requirements is key to retaining
and growing our business. Changes in the policies and requirements of our customers, particularly our
retailer customers, may negatively impact us. These could include, among other things, changes with
regard to inventory destocking, limitations on access to shelf space and the removal of our products, and
additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues. Changes
in end-consumer requirements could include, among other things, changes in favored sales channels
(e.g. through a shift to e-commerce versus traditional brick-and-mortar retailers), product innovations
and enhanced consumer focus or changing attitudes on safety, environmental, social and sustainability
issues. In particular, increasing consumer awareness and rising demand for eco-friendly products has
required us to invest significantly in developing products made with organic, recycled, sustainable or
environmentally friendly materials. Even if we are successful in creating innovative products that meet
consumers’ evolving requirements in this regard, we cannot assure that sales of such products or our
margins thereon will be sufficient to offset any resulting decline in sales of our traditional products. If


-----

sales of our products materially decrease or cease as a result of changes to any customer or endconsumer requirements or our inability to respond adequately to such changes, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, sales of disposable hygiene products via e-commerce has increased in adoption and
importance among market participants as more consumers purchase these goods through e-commerce
channels. We and our retailer customers are engaged in e-commerce sales channels with respect to
many of our products; however, if e-commerce and other sales channels were to take significant market
share away from traditional brick and mortar retailers, and if we or our retailer customers are not
successful in achieving sales growth in e-commerce, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be negatively impacted. While we are establishing an e-commerce footprint, there can be
no assurances that these initiatives will be successful.

**_Governments may reduce their spending on healthcare, which could adversely affect the business_**
**_that we do with public institutions._**

A significant portion of the customers in our Healthcare division are government and health administration
authorities and other third-party payers. Consequently, sales through that division, which are largely of
Adult Incontinence products, depend, in part, on the extent to which payments and reimbursements for
our products are available from these customers. Given pressure to reduce government spending in
many countries, payments or reimbursements for our products may be delayed, reduced or cancelled,
governments could default or the collection of outstanding accounts receivable could become more
difficult. Through our subsidiary Serenity S.p.A. (“Serenity”), an Italian seller of incontinence products,
we are particularly exposed to this risk, since Serenity currently generates more than half of its revenue
from public tender contracts with regional health authorities. Governments are also increasing pressure
to move away from single use products.

We have to date been successful in partially mitigating the reduction or cancellation of government
payments or reimbursements for these products through product upselling and an increase in sales of
our Adult Incontinence products via self-pay channels, such as drugstores, pharmacies, e-commerce
and retail outlets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in offsetting further
reductions or cancellations of payments or reimbursements, or that any resulting loss in revenue will be
fully compensated by an increase in sales through our other channels. Any reduction or cancellation of
payments or reimbursements for Adult Incontinence products sold through the Healthcare division could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain employees._**

The successful management and operation of our business depends in part upon the contribution of our
executive management team and other key personnel. In addition, our future success depends in part on
our ability to continue to recruit, train, motivate and retain employees. The loss of, or diminution in, service
of any of our executive management team or other key personnel, or our inability to attract and retain
new employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may be subject to losses that might be completely or partially uninsured._**

We maintain insurance policies with respect to certain operating risks, including product liability, damage
to property (including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of catastrophic events
such as fire, flood, storms and earthquakes), industrial accidents and directors’ and officers’ liability.
There can be no assurance that the level of insurance we maintain is appropriate for the risks to our
business or adequate to cover all potential claims. Certain types of losses (such as freight losses and
losses resulting from terrorist activities and wars) are not covered by our insurance policies and may be
either completely or partially uninsurable or not insurable on commercially reasonable terms. A
completely or partially uninsured loss suffered by us could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are unable to extend, renew or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements or if our_**
**_relationship with our employees or trade unions deteriorates, our business could be adversely_**
**_affected, and we may incur material one-off costs associated with reductions in our workforce._**

We had an average of 9,927 full-time equivalent employees during the year ended December 31, 2020.
A majority of our employees in Belgium, France, Spain, Italy and Germany are covered by collective


-----

bargaining agreements or represented by trade unions, local works councils or the European Works
Council. Additionally, a large portion of our workforce in Turkey, Algeria, Mexico and Brazil is covered by
collective bargaining agreements. In the Czech Republic, a minority of employees are represented by a
trade union.

While certain of our collective bargaining agreements are for an indefinite duration, others need to be
renewed from time to time. In the past five years, we have successfully concluded and/or renegotiated
collective bargaining agreements without material work stoppages. See “Business—Employees” for
further details of our collective bargaining agreements. Although we have not experienced difficulties in
the past in renewing our collective bargaining agreements on acceptable terms, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future.

Furthermore, in the future, should there be significant industrial action, disruptive works council activity or
disturbances across our workforce, we could experience a disruption of operations and increased costs
as a result. Although we can generally shift production to other facilities that are not affected by industrial
action, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in all cases.

Our business may also be adversely affected as a result of a deterioration of our relationship with our
employees, trade unions and other employee representative bodies. We continuously seek to optimize
our operating efficiency, including by rationalizing our manufacturing footprint, and we have closed
production facilities in the past and may do so in the future. As part of a broad strategic reevaluation of
our portfolio and the realignment of our business divisions, we have reviewed our global footprint and are
actively considering the best options to create value for the Group, including exiting from certain
geographies, lines of business and sales channels that do not form a core part of our renewed focus.
See “Business—Strategies—New Culture—Roll Out New Organizational Model and Performance
_Culture” and “Business—Strategies—Focused Portfolio—Divest Certain Non-Core Assets”. These_
strategic changes in our business may entail the closure of certain production facilities and the
consolidation of certain of our head office functions, either of which may result in meaningful headcount
reductions. We may incur one-off costs in connection with the implementation of these initiatives,
including in relation to employee severance and required social security payments, and these costs could
be material. Further, we may face industrial action or employees may otherwise oppose the closure of
production facilities. Any such actions could result in a deterioration of our relationship with our
employees. Any deterioration in our relationships with employees, trade unions, local work councils or the
European Works Council could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Increasing labor costs may adversely affect our profitability._**

An increase in our labor and employee benefit costs could adversely affect our profitability. Most of the
factors affecting labor costs are beyond our control and we may not be able to adjust our pricing to reflect
an increase in labor costs. A shortage of qualified employees, general inflationary pressure on wages or
an increase in national minimum wages or industry or union agreed wages in any of the jurisdictions in
which we operate could increase our labor costs and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure of our information systems and software could adversely affect our operations._**

Our business is dependent on the effective operation of our information technology, databases,
telecommunications networks, computer systems and other infrastructure, in particular the IT platform
we use to manage our operations, including sales, customer service, logistics and administration. Any
failure of our information technology networks and systems (or those of our third-party service providers)
could result in unforeseen expenses, disrupt our operations (via operational outages or aberrations or
otherwise) and adversely affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and others. In addition,
our information systems may be subject to damage or unanticipated interruptions from security breaches,
computer viruses, computer system or network failures, fire, flood, storms and other natural disasters,
power loss, operator negligence, physical or electronic loss of data, telecommunications failures,
vandalism or other extraordinary events. Although we are in the process of implementing a formal
business continuity program, until such program is complete and the required technology refinements
fully implemented, we can provide no assurance that any such failure, damage or interruption would not
have a material adverse effect on our operations and thereby our business, financial condition and results
of operations.


-----

Further, our systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service
providers, and banks, may become the target of advanced cyber-attacks or information security breaches
which will pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to
the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data of our Company, employees, customers or consumers,
and disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties. As cybersecurity threats
rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, we are
continually increasing our attention to these threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and
make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and
systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and
updating security policies for our Company and our third-party providers. However, because the
techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for
periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures
or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. As a result, a cyber-attack could negatively impact our net
sales and increase our operating and capital costs. In addition, our employees frequently access our
suppliers’ and customers’ systems and we may be liable if our employees are the source of any breaches
in these third-party systems. It could also damage our reputation with retailer customers and consumers
and diminish the strength and reputation of our brands, or require us to pay monetary penalties.

Periodically, we also need to upgrade our information technology systems or adopt new technologies. If
such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased
cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, produce and ship orders,
and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. The
costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation
measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results.

**_A breach of data privacy regulations may result in significant fines and penalties, affect our_**
**_reputation and adversely affect our business._**

In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data in our technology systems. This
data includes confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, as
well as personally identifiable information of individuals, including our employees. Although there is a
particular focus on the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), several other countries
in which we operate have also recently adopted similar data protection legislation, including Brazil
(LGPD), Turkey (KVKK) and others. While this legislation varies by country or region, it is often
comprehensive and becoming more complex. There has also been a recent trend toward more stringent
enforcement of requirements regarding protection of personal data under these regimes, and our failure
to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant monetary forfeitures and other penalties.
In particular, through our Healthcare division, we routinely process and retain sensitive personal data,
including specific information regarding individuals’ health histories or medical conditions, which we
request in order to recommend the most appropriate Adult Incontinence products for each individual. The
processing and storage of such information is highly regulated under GDPR and other applicable privacy
regimes, and any mishandling of this data could subject us to significant regulatory penalties or civil
liabilities. As such, any breach in data privacy protection regulations could have a material adverse effect
on our business and could lead to a negative reputational impact.

**_Climate and environmental expectations and requirements may negatively affect our business_**
**_and results of operations._**

Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global
temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.
Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or
flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain.

Concern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements
designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the
environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations,
we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and
distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.


-----

We are furthermore subject to the risk that we would not be able to respond in a timely manner to climate
and environmental expectations and requirements from our customers, governments and other
stakeholders. This is particularly relevant in relation to certain sensitive raw materials which we require to
manufacture our products and produce disposable finished products, such as paper pulp and plastics.
Restrictions or bans on the sale of single-use plastics have been increasing in certain parts of the world
and represent one of our primary challenges in coming years. Heightened consumer scrutiny of
disposable products and packaging (in particular plastics), and increased consumer demands with
respect to sustainable, recyclable and eco-friendly products could ultimately require us to incur significant
costs in substituting certain materials or designing new products. We cannot assure that we will be
successful in sourcing alternate materials or developing sustainable products, or that we will be able to
pass on any increased costs of such products to our customers. We are at risk of losing market share if
stakeholder expectations cannot be met at a competitive price. New regulations in this respect may also
increase the cost of doing business.

**_Adverse publicity and the use of social media may adversely affect our reputation or subject us_**
**_to fines or other penalties._**

We may be subject to adverse publicity relating to, among other things, our product quality, brands,
customer complaints, production facilities and employee relationships. Adverse publicity may negatively
impact our reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. The negative impact of adverse
publicity relating to any of our products, brands or production facilities may extend far beyond the product,
brand or facility involved to affect some or all of our other products, brands and facilities. Any such
adverse publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We use third-party social media platforms as, among other things, marketing tools. For example, we
maintain Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts. As existing e-commerce and social
media platforms continue to rapidly evolve and new platforms develop, we must continue to maintain a
presence on these platforms and establish presences on new or emerging social media platforms. As
laws and regulations and public opinion rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices,
the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and
regulations in the use of these platforms and devices or otherwise could subject us to regulatory
investigations, class action lawsuits, liability, fines or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Negative commentary regarding us, our products and other third parties who are affiliated with us may
also be posted on social media platforms and may be adverse to our reputation or business. It is not
possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to detect and respond to this activity may
not be effective in all cases. Consumers rely increasingly on social media platforms for readily available
information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its
accuracy. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.

**_Changes in assumptions underlying the carrying value of our assets, including as a result of_**
**_adverse market conditions, could result in impairment of such assets, including intangible assets_**
**_such as goodwill._**

As of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of €1,160.2 million, representing
37.8% of our total assets. There can be no assurance that we will not in the future be required to recognize
an impairment charge in respect of our goodwill or other intangible assets.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use
are tested at least annually for impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Goodwill
on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets and is tested annually for impairment and
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Although we did not recognize any impairments in respect of goodwill or other intangible assets during
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, there can be no assurance as to the absence of
significant impairment charges in the future, especially if market conditions were to deteriorate. While
impairments do not affect our cash flows, a small impairment charge relative to the total amount of


-----

goodwill could, given the significant amount of goodwill recorded on our statement of financial position,
adversely affect our operating profit and equity. For instance, an impairment charge in the amount of 10%
of the goodwill on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a 99.8% reduction
in our operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a 10.1% reduction in our equity as of
December 31, 2020. Therefore, a goodwill impairment could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results._**

As a multi-national company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required to determine worldwide tax liabilities, including, among other reasons, because tax laws and
regulations in effect in the various countries in which we operate do not always provide clear and definitive
guidelines. Our effective tax rates and tax exposure could be affected by changes in the composition of
our earnings in countries or jurisdictions with higher or lower tax rates, changes to transfer pricing rules,
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, our ability to utilize tax losses and tax
credits (of which we had €557.3 million as of December 31, 2020) or changes in the tax laws and the way
such tax laws are applied by tax administrations (possibly with retroactive effect), including through tax
rulings issued by the relevant competent tax authorities.

In addition, we are subject to regular audits of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the various
countries in which we operate. From time to time various governments make substantive changes to tax
rules and the application of rules to companies, including changes potentially impacting our ability to
defer taxes on international earnings. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable
outcomes in tax audits and amendments to tax laws and regulations in order to determine the adequacy
of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, the outcomes of which
are difficult to predict. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which may involve
substantial claims for damages or other payments. Although individually these proceedings do not
typically involve substantial amounts, in the aggregate such proceedings or any increase in the number
of such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a
settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the costs related
to litigation proceedings may be significant. Even if there is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any
negative publicity surrounding assertions against our business or products could adversely affect our
reputation and we may still have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are
not reimbursable by other litigants, insurance or otherwise, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Business—Legal Proceedings”.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, as well as rules and regulations of
the European Union. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and proceedings by
national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of antitrust
laws, which could result in fines or other forms of liability, or otherwise damage our business reputation,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
For example, in 2018 COFECE, the Mexican antitrust authority, opened an investigation in relation to
potential anticompetitive conduct among manufacturers in the personal hygiene industry in Mexico,
including Grupo Mabe, which we acquired in 2016. The investigation relates to periods prior to our
acquisition of Mabe, and we have been proactively and fully cooperating with COFECE in its investigation.
While this investigation is ongoing, we do not believe that it will result in material liabilities for Ontex.
Please see “Business—Legal Proceedings”. However, we cannot assure that we will not be subject to
similar investigations in the future or that such investigations will not result in significant monetary


-----

penalties or other remedies. Such laws and regulations could limit or prohibit our ability to grow in certain
markets, in particular markets characterized by a high degree of industry consolidation.

**_We are exposed to general counterparty risk._**

We have contracts with a variety of third parties including, among others, customers, suppliers and
hedging counterparties. We do not have control over the management or business of these third parties
except indirectly through terms we negotiate in our contracts with these third parties and we are exposed
to risks associated with the financial condition of these third parties. If any of these third parties
experience financial difficulties or changes or terminates its contractual commitments to us, we may incur
costs enforcing our contractual rights and we may incur significant losses from our exposure to third
parties. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to interest rate risks._**

We are subject to interest rate risks as we have certain interest determined on a variable basis, either
through unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts, that could lead to a material increase
in our obligations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will, or will be able to, hedge our full
exposure or that our hedging transactions will be effective. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized
activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with our ordinary
business. Depending on market conditions and movements in interest rates, our use of hedging
transactions could enhance or harm our overall performance compared to our competitors. In addition,
we are subject to the creditworthiness of the counterparties under our hedging transactions, and we will
be exposed to the risk of insolvency or default on the part of our hedge counterparties.

**Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees**

**_There can be no assurance that all of the Guarantors will provide Guarantees to the Notes within_**
**_the time period specified in the Indenture._**

On the Issue Date, the Guarantors will guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be successful in procuring the issuance of the Guarantees within the time period
specified. Moreover, it should be noted that, in certain jurisdictions, if a guarantee is granted after the
underlying obligation arose, such guarantee may be subject to claw-back provisions under applicable
local insolvency laws. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_The substantial leverage and debt service obligations of the Group could adversely affect its_**
**_business and may prevent it from fulfilling its obligations, including under the Notes and_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Group currently has, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant amount
of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of March 31, 2021, on an unaudited
as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, the Group would have had €902.1 million of
outstanding total indebtedness (excluding lease liabilities of €130.7 million), including €580.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby and €220.0 million representing the aggregate
principal amount of the New Term Loan Facility under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement. In
addition, the Issuer’s Revolving Credit Facility (which it does not expect to be drawn on the Issue Date)
provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of €250.0 million, subject to certain conditions. See
“Capitalization”. The Group anticipates that its high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable
future and the covenants under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will provide
the Group with significant flexibility to incur additional debt and make dividends or other distributions. Its
significant leverage could have important consequences for the Group’s business and operations and for
holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for the Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations with respect to
the Notes and its and their other debts and liabilities, including under the New Term Loan Facility
and New Revolving Credit Facility;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the repayment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow,
and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, joint ventures, working
capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;


-----

   - increasing its vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, a downturn in its business or
general economic or industry conditions;

  - placing the Group at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower leverage or
greater financial resources;

   - limiting its flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in its business and
industry;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with its creditors;

  - increasing its exposure to interest rate increases because some of its indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest; and

   - limiting, among other things, its ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the
future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy its debt obligations,
including the Notes. The Group’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt will depend on its
future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. The Group’s ability to generate
cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory
factors and other factors beyond its control. It may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or obtain enough capital to service its debt or to fund future acquisitions or working capital
expenditures.

For further information regarding the Group’s substantial leverage and for more information about its
indebtedness that will remain outstanding following the consummation of the Transactions, see also
“Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Indenture and certain of the Group’s other outstanding debt_**
**_agreements will limit its ability to take certain actions, which may limit the Group’s ability to_**
**_finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture, the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and other outstanding debt agreements limit
the Group’s flexibility to operate its business. For example, certain of these agreements restrict the
Issuer’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt;

   - create or incur certain liens or secure indebtedness;

   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, in respect of the shares of such
entity;

   - enter into guarantees with respect to certain types of indebtedness without also guaranteeing the
Notes;

  - pay dividends;

   - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;

   - make minority or joint venture investments;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

   - create unrestricted subsidiaries; or

   - merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’
assets.

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains a maintenance financial covenant that is tested on a
semi-annual basis. In addition, the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides for various customary
representations and undertakings as well as affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including
relating to acquisitions, disposals and mergers, which restrict certain aspects of the Issuer’s business, as
well as events of default provisions. If the Issuer fails to comply with any of these representations,
undertakings, or covenants and it is unable to remedy (if applicable) such failure or fail to obtain a waiver


-----

or consent, a default could result under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement which could result in
termination rights, acceleration rights, draw stops or increases in interest rates or fees. In these
circumstances, the Issuer’s assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full the defaulted debt
under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement. If such debt was accelerated and the Issuer’s financial
resources were insufficient to discharge its obligations under such agreement, the Issuer could be forced
into bankruptcy or liquidation.

The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture and certain of the Issuer’s credit
facilities may adversely affect its ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or engage in other
business activities that may be in the Issuer’s interest. In addition to limiting the Issuer’s flexibility in
operating its business, a breach of the covenants in the Indenture or certain of the Issuer’s credit facilities
could cause a default under the terms of each of those agreements, thereby causing all the debt under
those agreements to be accelerated. If this were to occur, the Issuer may not have sufficient liquid assets
to repay its debt.

Certain of the Group’s credit facilities, including the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture, require the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries to comply with various covenants, including
certain financial covenants, which require the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries to maintain specified
financial ratios, satisfy specified financial tests and comply with operational parameters and certain other
undertakings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements”. The Issuer and its relevant subsidiaries’ ability to meet these financial ratios and financial_
tests could be affected by deterioration in the Issuer’s operating results, as well as by events beyond the
Issuer’s control, including unfavorable economic conditions, and there can be no assurance that the
Issuer and its relevant subsidiaries will be able to meet these financial ratios and financial tests. Moreover,
certain credit facilities of the Issuer include, and in the future might include, certain events of default
(such as breaches of representations, warranties and undertakings and if the Issuer or certain of its
subsidiaries fail to make payment when due on certain other debt) that are different from the events of
default set forth in the Indenture. If an event of default occurs under the Indenture or any of the Issuer’s
other debt instruments and is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their
commitments and declare all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees,
to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under the Issuer’s debt instruments, including the Notes,
that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable
on demand as a result of an event of default under such debt instruments. In these circumstances, the
Issuer’s assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full the defaulted debt and its other debt,
including the Notes then outstanding. If some or all of these instruments were accelerated, the Issuer
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, and it may not be able to repay its obligations under the
Notes in such an event.

Any future debt may include similar or other restrictive terms. These restrictions could materially and
adversely affect the Group’s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs or to engage in other
business activities or consummate transactions that may be in its best interests.

**_The Issuer may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for it to_**
**_service its debt, including the Notes, and impair its ability to operate its business._**

The Group may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in connection with future
acquisitions. As of March 31, 2021, on an unaudited as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions,
the Group would have had €902.1 million of outstanding total indebtedness (excluding lease liabilities of
€130.7 million), including €580.0 million in aggregate principal amount under the Notes and €220.0 million
representing the aggregate principal amount under the New Term Loan Facility under the New Syndicated
Facilities Agreement. See “Capitalization”. In addition, the Issuer’s Revolving Credit Facility (which it
does not expect to be drawn on the Issue Date) provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of
€250.0 million, subject to certain conditions.

The terms of the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will permit its subsidiaries to
incur additional debt as well, in each case, subject to certain limitations. See also “— The Notes and the
_Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Group’s non_
_guarantor subsidiaries”. These limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and_
exceptions and as a result, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, the debt the Group may incur in the
future could be structurally senior to the Notes, could mature prior to the Notes or may be secured by
collateral. Although the Indenture and the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement will contain restrictions


-----

on the incurrence of such additional senior indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of senior
indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.

If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that the
Issuer now faces would increase. For a discussion of its cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. In addition, the Indenture will_
not prevent the Issuer from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements,
including trade payables. The Group’s inability to service its debt could have a material adverse effect on
its business, financial position and results of operations and its ability to fulfill its obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The terms of the Group’s borrowings could materially adversely affect its financial condition and_**
**_the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains a maintenance financial covenant._**

The Group faces a variety of risks related to its borrowings, including the risk that interest expense
arising from these borrowings may increase in the future. The Group may wish to undertake additional
borrowings in the future, including for investment and capital expenditure to support ongoing operations
or for potential future acquisitions, which could increase its exposure to these borrowing-related risks.
Also, some of its borrowings have covenants related to the total debt leverage of the Group, which when
breached could lead to either an increase in the interest that the borrowing accrues or a repayment
obligation in respect of such borrowing. In particular, the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains
a maintenance financial covenant that is tested on a semi-annual basis. In light of the risks associated
with the Group’s business described in more detail in this Offering Memorandum, the Group may not be
able to maintain its current financial position at the levels required to meet the maintenance financial
covenant in the future. A breach of the maintenance financial covenant would result in a default under the
New Syndicated Facilities Agreement unless the Issuer can obtain waivers or consents in respect of any
breach of the obligations thereunder. It is uncertain whether these waivers or consents would be granted.
In the event of any default under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the lender or lenders
thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and
other amounts owing thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, indebtedness under
other instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Notes, may
also be accelerated and become due and payable. See “Description of _Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities Agreement—Events of Default”._

The Group also faces risks that, in the long term, it may be unable to refinance some or all of its
borrowings on similar terms to its existing debt, on terms that it deems appropriate or at all. The Group’s
ability to refinance its borrowings or to undertake additional borrowings in the future may be affected by
a number of factors, including its operating and financial performance, as well as broader market and
macroeconomic conditions that are outside its control.

If the Group’s future cash flow from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under
the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement) is insufficient to pay its obligations as they mature or to fund its
liquidity needs, it may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay certain business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets or equity;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital;

   - forgo strategic opportunities, such as acquisitions of other businesses; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure that it would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt which the Issuer
may incur, if the Issuer does not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to
pay its debt obligations, or to fund its other liquidity needs or the Issuer is otherwise restricted from doing
so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, it may be required to refinance its debt. Any refinancing
of its debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Group to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on the Group’s cash needs and the
prevailing conditions in the financial markets. If the Group is unable to refinance all or a portion of its debt


-----

or to obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to the Group, it may be forced to reduce or delay its
business activities or capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in
amounts that could be substantial. In addition, the terms of the Notes and any future debt may limit the
Issuer’s ability to pursue any of these measures.

If the Group is unable to satisfy its obligations through alternative financing, it may not be able to satisfy
its debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreements or
instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the New
Syndicated Facilities Agreement, may become payable on demand, and the Issuer may not have sufficient
funds to repay all its debts, including the Notes.

A significant change in finance costs, whether due to higher levels of borrowing or an increase in interest
payable on future borrowings, or an inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all may have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
and the business.

**_The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no or limited revenue-_**
**_generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the operating companies of the_**
**_Group to be able to make payments on the Notes or the Guarantees._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies with no or limited business operations
and no assets other than inter-company receivables and the equity interests they hold in each of their
subsidiaries. These entities will therefore be dependent on the cash flow from the operating subsidiaries
of the Group in the form of dividends, interest payments on inter-company loans or other distributions or
payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, as
well as under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement.

If the subsidiaries of the Issuer do not fulfil their obligations under the inter-company loans and do not
distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other
source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. The amounts of
dividends and distributions available to the Issuer and the holding company Guarantors will depend on
the profitability and cash flows of the operating companies within the Group. The subsidiaries of the
Issuer may not, however, be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to pay dividends or
distributions or otherwise make upstream payments or advance upstream loans to their shareholders
(including the Issuer and the holding company Guarantors) to make payments in respect of its debt,
including the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other_**
**_obligations of the Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Only the Guarantors will provide the Guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Any claim by
the Group or any of its creditors, including the holders of the Notes, against any non-guarantor
subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of such subsidiaries, including
trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries. The Indenture does not limit the transfer
of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined
therein and in the “Description of the Notes”), including its subsidiaries that do not provide guarantees for
the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors
accounted for 79% of the consolidated total assets, 76% of the consolidated revenue and 96% of the
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Group, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, the Issuer’s direct and
indirect subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes had €66.2 million of outstanding total indebtedness
(excluding lease liabilities of €43.4 million).

In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of these non-guarantor subsidiaries,
creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full from their
respective assets before the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is entitled to receive any distribution from
such assets as equity holders. Except to the extent that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors may itself be
a creditor with recognized claims against a non-guarantor subsidiary, claims of creditors of such nonguarantor subsidiary will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the
claims of the Issuer or the Guarantors as equity holders, and there is no assurance that the claims (if
any) of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a creditor against a non-guarantor subsidiary may not be
reduced, limited or extinguished as a result of applicable insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of


-----

equitable subordination or the rules regarding the potential avoidance of transactions concluded with
related persons within a certain hardening period). Non-guarantor subsidiaries are also subject to
liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business (such as
trade payables), which liabilities are also effectively senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Claims of secured creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors will have priority with respect to their_**
**_collateral over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent_**
**_of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets. As a
result, claims of secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness and other secured obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness or other obligations (except to the extent such assets in the future also secure the
Notes and the Guarantees on an equal and ratable basis or priority basis). Although the Indenture limits
the incurrence of secured indebtedness, such limitations are subject to a number of significant
exceptions.

In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or
other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at a time when it has secured
obligations, holders of secured indebtedness will have priority claims to the assets of the Issuer or such
Guarantor that constitute their collateral (other than to the extent such assets in the future also secure the
Notes and the Guarantees on an equal and ratable basis or priority basis). The holders of the Notes will
participate ratably with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and
potentially with all their other respective general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to
each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be.
The claims of holders of the Notes and other unsecured creditors will also depend on whether there is
any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any secured assets. If any of the secured indebtedness of
the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes due or the creditors thereunder proceed against the operating
assets that secure such indebtedness, their assets remaining after repayment of that secured
indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes. As a result,
holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer or the
Guarantors.

**_Some of the group’s indebtedness, including under the New Syndicated Facilities, will bear_**
**_interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing costs and reducing cash_**
**_flow, and that may be impacted by applicable law and regulation._**

A significant portion of the Issuer’s outstanding borrowings bear interest at floating rates. In particular,
following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will have outstanding indebtedness under the
New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and other floating-rate debt instruments, exposing the Issuer to the
fluctuations of variable interest rates based on benchmark rates such as the Euro Interbank Offered
Rate (“EURIBOR”) (subject to a zero floor if less than zero). Increases in the applicable benchmark rates
used in the calculation of interest on these borrowings would result in higher interest expenses to service
these debt levels in the future. An increase in variable and/or fixed interest rates may result in the Issuer
incurring interest expense and cash outflows in relation to these debt instruments at higher levels than
anticipated, thereby reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering the Issuer’s
ability to make payments on the Notes. These rates could increase significantly and for a variety of
reasons, including due to changes in the monetary and interest rate policies of central banks, as well as
broader macro-economic conditions in the European Union, United Kingdom and globally. While the
Group currently intends to hedge a portion of its interest rate exposure, including in respect of its
borrowings under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, it is under no obligation to do so. Neither the
New Syndicated Facilities Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring the Group to hedge
all or any portion of its floating rate debt, and any hedging activity in respect of the Group’s variable-rate
debt may be discontinued at any time. Further, there can be no assurance that, if the Group wishes to
hedge its interest rate exposure, such hedging arrangements will be available to the Group on
commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, another measure of interbank lending rates, regulators
and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union have conducted


-----

investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily
EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate
EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and
indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered
into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the
past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be
predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no
longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021.
Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that 26 LIBOR settings
will cease to be published after December 31, 2021 (or, in respect of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR settings,
June 30, 2023). The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner
of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in
changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, will require an adjustment to the
terms and conditions, and may result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such
benchmark (including but not limited to the facilities under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement,
whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR, SONIA and EURIBOR and, in respect of LIBOR, include
mechanics to switch the variable rate element of the interest rate applicable to loans in certain currencies
(including U.S. dollars) to rates based on a risk free rate applicable to the relevant currency plus a credit
adjustment spread). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other variable rate
and/or a change to the benchmark by reference to which the interest on our floating rate debt is
determined, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest
at floating rates of interest.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment_**
**_grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment
grade by S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided at such time no Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants, which include
restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to, among other things, pay dividends, incur debt and enter into certain
other transactions, will be suspended for the duration of the period during which the Notes maintain an
investment grade rating. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade,
or that if they are rated investment grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. Suspension of these
covenants, however, would allow the Issuer to engage in certain transactions that would not have been
permitted while these covenants were in force, and such transactions will not result in a breach of the
Indenture if the Notes subsequently fail to maintain an investment grade rating. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”._

**_Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes._**

The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as more fully described in “Description of the
_Notes”. In the event that the Issuer exercises the option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes_
may suffer a lower than expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.

**_The insolvency laws of applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency_**
**_laws of the jurisdictions with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees,_**
**_including fraudulent conveyance or corporate assistance statutes, may adversely affect their_**
**_validity and enforceability._**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The
Issuer is organized under the laws of Belgium, and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Delaware, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland and
Spain. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main interest”, or COMI, as defined in the
Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction
where the registered office is situated.


-----

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, a Guarantor or
any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance
and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer and the
enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor. In certain circumstances the court may also void the
Guarantee if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent
transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and
principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences,
transactions at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds.
If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee;

   - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to
the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the relevant Guarantor’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a preference,
transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, the Issuer
cannot assure you that it can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee is limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee
not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
The amount recoverable from a Guarantor is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also
the possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
_limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees”._

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the relevant Guarantee was issued and in case such
transaction occurred within a specific time period before the opening of insolvency proceedings, the
relevant Guarantor:

  - issued such Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future
creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others;

  - issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessperson as a shareholder of such
Guarantor would not have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary
of the Guarantee knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made;

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee
on the basis that the Guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s
benefit, or on some other basis and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance
of the Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons;

   - was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the relevant Guarantor’s
assets were unreasonably small; or

   - intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as
and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different
jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

  - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or


-----

   - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that each Guarantor is solvent, there can be no assurance as to which standard a
court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees
were issued or were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or
not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the
Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability limitations as they relate to the Guarantees,
see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations”._

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_**
**_Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees._**

The Guarantors are organized under the laws of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Delaware, England and
Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain and Poland. Enforcement of the obligations under a
Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant
Guarantor under applicable local law. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar
laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting
the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be
contractually limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor under the
applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee is not in the relevant
Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant
Guarantor, or such Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin
capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such
subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

Each Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending
upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This can lead to a situation in
which such Guarantee cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or any of its creditors, or
the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a
Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee on any of the above
grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. To
the extent that any limitations on the relevant Guarantees apply, the Notes would be to that extent
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such
Guarantor. Future Note Guarantees may be subject to similar limitations.

See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations”._

**_Belgian insolvency laws may not be as favorable as insolvency laws of other jurisdictions._**

In the event of a bankruptcy order under Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law in respect of the
Issuer the Belgian Guarantor, the directors and managers of the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor
immediately lose all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business,
and a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee will take control of the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor.
Creditors must file a notice of claim and as a general rule, their individual enforcement rights are
suspended.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings under Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law
in respect of the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor, the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor continues as a
going concern and control remains (in principle) with its directors. Restructuring proceedings may
ultimately lead to an amicable settlement with two or more creditors only, a collective reorganization plan
binding all creditors or a court-organized auction of part of all of the Issuer’s or the Belgian Guarantor’s
assets. Subject to some limited exceptions, the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor will benefit from a
temporary moratorium, which operates as a stay of enforcement in respect of pre-existing claims in the
moratorium.


-----

In case of bankruptcy, certain transactions or payments that were effected either with fraudulent intent or
during specified hardening periods in advance of a bankruptcy event, may be held ineffective against
third parties (and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy trustees). In the event of bankruptcy of the
Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor under applicable Belgian law, the relevant bankruptcy trustee may request
the bankruptcy court to declare payments of the Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor during the hardening
period for debts due ineffective against third parties, provided it can be established that the creditor
concerned was aware of the cessation of payment (staking van betaling/cessation de paiement) of the
Issuer or the Belgian Guarantor. If the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor were successfully held
ineffective by the relevant bankruptcy trustee, holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in
respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such
Guarantee.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes in and across multiple jurisdictions may prove_**
**_difficult._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Delaware,
England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland and Spain. In addition, the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. In addition, as the
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts against them within the United States.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, or in order to enforce payment claims,
proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions mentioned above. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. or
any other court against the Issuer or any Guarantor or a security provider, holders of the Notes will need
to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. The enforcement of
foreign judgments is subject to a variety of requirements in the relevant jurisdictions, may be refused on
public policy or other grounds, and can be complex and time consuming. The holders of the Notes should
consult with their advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries
or elsewhere outside the United States. In addition, other creditors, including the lenders under the New
Syndicated Facilities Agreement, may succeed in independently enforcing competing claims before
payment claims under the Indenture or the Notes are satisfied. Outside a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, there is no requirement to share or equalize enforcement proceeds between different
groups of creditors.

Any multi-jurisdictional proceeding is likely to be complex, time-consuming and costly for creditors and
may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under
the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws, and
there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, legal changes such as moratoriums in certain
types of enforcement that have been and may be adopted as a result of the COVID-19 crisis may further
complicate your ability to enforce your rights in such proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s or any of the
Guarantor’s jurisdictions may be materially different from, or be in conflict with those of the United States
and other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar, including in the areas such as the rights of creditors,
the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration
of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights
under the Notes in the relevant jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See also
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”.

**_The Issuer may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of_**
**_control and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a change of_**
**_control._**

The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” in relation to the
Issuer. Upon the occurrence of an event constituting a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer
will be required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of repurchase and
Additional Amounts, if any.


-----

In addition, a change of control under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement (which includes a different
definition of change of control), unless waived by the lenders, would permit any lender under the New
Syndicated Facilities Agreement to elect to cancel its commitments thereunder and the participation of
that lender in all amounts outstanding under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement would become
immediately due and payable together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other amounts due to that
lender that are accrued and unpaid.

The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes or loan repayment required as a result of any such
event would be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including
borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by the Issuer’s subsidiaries. Sufficient
funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make any required repurchases of the Notes
tendered, and the Issuer may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the required
repurchases of the Notes tendered. The inability to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change
of control would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture, which could trigger a cross-default
under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness of the Group. See “Description
_of the Notes—Change of Control”. The Issuer’s failure to repay any outstanding amounts under the New_
Syndicated Facilities Agreement upon the occurrence of a change of control event would constitute an
event of default thereunder, which could, in turn, trigger a cross-default under the Indenture. In addition,
the Group’s other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to
certain events or transactions that could constitute a change of control under the terms of the Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes
(including certain reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or other similar transactions) because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may
not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions that require us to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, change a majority
of the board of directors, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition
of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
change of control has occurred and whether a holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The right of holders to have their Notes repurchased upon the occurrence of a change of control_**
**_is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Issuer and until such time the holders will not_**
**_have an enforceable claim for the repurchase of their Notes upon a change of control._**

Investors should be aware that their right to have their Notes repurchased upon the occurrence of a
change of control is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Issuer. Until such time as the change
of control provision is approved by the shareholders of the Issuer and filed with the clerk of the competent
enterprise court in accordance with Article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code,
holders of Notes will not have an enforceable claim for the repurchase of their Notes upon the occurrence
of a change of control. Under the terms of the Notes and the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the
Issuer is required (i) to submit the change of control provision at its next general meeting of shareholders
for approval by its shareholders and (ii) to provide evidence of filing of such approval with the clerk of the
competent enterprise court by no later than June 30, 2022. Failure by the Issuer to satisfy the above
requirements would constitute a breach under the Indenture and the New Syndicated Facilities
Agreement, respectively, and subject to the notice delivery requirements and respective grace periods,
constitute an event of default under the Indenture and the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement. Upon
acceleration by holders constituting 25% of the Notes outstanding, or the Majority Lenders (as defined in
the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement), as applicable, the principal, premium and accrued but unpaid
interest under the Indenture or the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, as applicable, will become
immediately due and payable. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities Agreement—Mandatory Prepayment”._


-----

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in
this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not
a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. In case ratings are assigned to the Issuer or its debt instruments, the
Issuer faces the risk of rating downgrades in the future. Any downgrade of the Issuer’s credit ratings
could have a negative impact on the pricing and availability of future financing. The Issuer may be unable
to generate the strong cash flows necessary to reduce its financial indebtedness, which may have a
detrimental impact on its credit ratings and refinancing capabilities. No assurance can be given that a
credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more
of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if the Group’s creditworthiness worsens._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives the Group to be less likely to fully
perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the
crystallization of any of the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section. Even if the Group’s ability to fully
perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants
could nevertheless have a different perception. In addition, market participants’ estimation of the
creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same business as the Group
could adversely change, thereby causing the market value of the Notes to fall. If any of these events
occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than before the
crystallization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could decrease.

**_Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions._**

The Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any state
or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not transfer or offer to sell the
Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of
the United States, or pursuant to an effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the
risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. In addition, by acceptance of delivery
of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for
which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of
less than €100,000. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes
under any other country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion
in the sections entitled “Notice to Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions” for further information about
these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors in the Notes to ensure that their subscription
for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with any applicable securities laws.

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the_**
**_Notes will be able to sell them._**

There Notes are new securities for which there is currently no established market. The Issuer has made
an application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admit them to
trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof, but cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of the holders of the Notes to sell such Notes or the price at which they
may be able to sell such Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Notes depend on many factors,
including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar
securities and general economic conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed the Group that they
intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do
so. Any market-making that is commenced may be halted at any time. In addition, changes in the overall
market for high yield securities and changes in the Issuer’s financial performance in the markets in which


-----

the Issuer operates may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading market in the Notes that does develop
and any market price quoted for the Notes. As a result, the Issuer cannot ensure that an active trading
market will actually develop for the Notes or that, if developed, such market will be maintained.

Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject
to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent
of our financial performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer intends to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to have them admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market shortly after the Issue Date
(and, in any event, before the first coupon payment date in respect of the Notes) and to maintain such
listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure prospective investors that the
Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly onerous to make or maintain such listing,
the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, provided that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of
the Notes on another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers, although there can be no
assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the
Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized
listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing
or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another stock
exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. An investment in the Notes denominated in a
currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will
entail foreign exchange related risks due to, amongst other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors over
which the Issuer has no control. Depreciation of the euro against other relevant currencies could cause
a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to
you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the
return on your investments. There may be tax consequences for prospective investors as a result of any
foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in the Notes. Please see “Certain Tax
_Considerations”._

In addition, despite the measures taken by countries in the Eurozone to alleviate credit risk, concerns
persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial
obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone member states. These and other
concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more member states, or, in
more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve
entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be
determined by laws in effect at such time. We cannot assure that the official exchange rate at which the
Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential developments,
or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the
value of the Notes.

In addition, there may be tax consequences for prospective investors as a result of any foreign exchange
gains or losses for any investment in the Notes. Please see “Certain Tax Considerations”.

**_Interest payments on the Notes may be subject to Belgian withholding tax._**

Payments of interest on the Notes made by the Issuer will be subject to Belgian withholding tax, currently
30% of the gross amount of the interest on the Notes, unless certain exemptions apply. One such
exemption provides for payments of interest by the Issuer on the Notes without deduction or withholding
tax in the event that the Notes are held by certain Eligible Investors (as defined in “Description of the
_Notes”) in an exempt security account that has been opened with a financial institution that is a direct or_


-----

indirect participant in the NBB-SSS. As a result, if a holder of the Notes is not an Eligible Investor or holds
a Definitive Registered Note (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) that can no longer be cleared
through the NBB-SSS, such holder may be subject to Belgian withholding tax. Additionally, in case the
holder of the Notes is not an Eligible Investor holding its Notes in an exempt securities account that has
been opened with a financial institution that is a direct or indirect participant in the NBB-SSS, such holder
will be unable to avail itself of the withholding tax gross-up provisions under the Indenture. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Certain Tax Considerations—Belgian withholding
_tax”._

**_The proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive (the “Draft
**Directive”) for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,**
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia, within the framework of an enhanced cooperation procedure. In
December 2015, Estonia withdrew from the group of states willing to introduce the FTT (the
“Participating Member States”). The Draft Directive has very broad scope and could, if introduced,
apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Pursuant to the Draft Directive, the FTT shall be payable on financial transactions provided at least one
party to the financial transaction is established, or deemed established, in a Participating Member State
and there is a financial institution established, or deemed established, in a Participating Member State
which is a party to the financial transaction, or is acting in the name of a party to the transaction. Under
the Draft Directive, the FTT would not apply to (inter alia) primary market transactions referred to in
Article 5 (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006, including the activity of underwriting and subsequent
allocation of financial instruments in the framework of their issue.

In 2019, Finance Ministers of the States participating in the enhanced cooperation indicated that they
were discussing a new FTT proposal based on the French model of the tax and the possible mutualization
of the tax as a contribution to the EU budget.

According to the latest draft of this new FTT proposal (submitted by the German government), the FTT
would be levied at a rate of at least 0.2% of the consideration for the acquisition of ownership of shares
(including ordinary and any preference shares) admitted to trading on a trading venue or a similar third
country venue, or of other securities equivalent to such shares (“Financial Instruments”) or similar
transactions (e.g. an acquisition of Financial Instruments by means of an exchange of Financial
Instruments or by means of a physical settlement of a derivative). Only transactions with Financial
Instruments that have been issued by a company, partnership or other entity whose registered office is
established within one of the Participating Member States and with a market capitalization of at least
EUR 1 billion on December 1 of the year preceding the respective transaction would be covered. Under
this revised proposal, the FTT would be payable to the Participating Member State in whose territory the
issuer of a Financial Instrument has established its registered office. Based on the latest draft of the new
FTT proposal, the FTT should in principle not apply to the Notes. Like the Draft Directive, the latest draft
of the new FTT proposal also stipulates that once the FTT enters into force, the Participating Member
States shall not maintain or introduce taxes on financial transactions other than the FTT (or VAT as
provided in the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value
added tax).

The FTT proposal is still subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and therefore
may be changed at any time. Moreover, if the FTT proposal is ultimately adopted (the “FTT Directive”), it
will need to be implemented into the respective domestic laws of the Participating Member States and
the domestic provisions implementing the FTT Directive might deviate from the FTT Directive itself.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the FTT, as ultimately implemented, will not apply to dealings
in the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the
consequences of the FTT associated with subscribing for, purchasing, holding and disposing of the
Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely_**
**_on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will be issued in dematerialized form in accordance with the Belgian Companies and
Associations Code and cannot be physically delivered. The Notes will be represented exclusively by book
entries in the records of the NBB-SSS. Access to the NBB-SSS is available through its NBB-SSS


-----

participants whose membership extends to securities such as the Notes. NBB-SSS participants include
certain banks, stockbrokers (beursvennootschappen/sociétés de bourse), and Euroclear, Clearstream
and the other NBB Participants. Except under the limited circumstances described in the Indenture,
Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

A holder of Notes must rely on the procedures of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear, Clearstream and the other
NBB Participants to receive payments under the Notes or communications from the Issuer. The Issuer
and the Guarantors will have no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in
respect of, the Notes within the NBB-SSS. As long as the Notes are clearing through the NBB-SSS, the
Paying Agent will debit the relevant account of the Issuer and use such funds to make payment to the
owners of the book-entry interests. The Paying Agent will, simultaneously with the receipt by it of the
relevant amounts, pay to the owners of the book-entry interests, directly or through the NBB, any amounts
due in respect of the Notes. However, the Paying Agent is not required to segregate any such amounts
received by it in respect of the Notes and in the event that the Paying Agent were subject to insolvency
proceedings at any time when it held such amounts, owners of the book-entry interests would not have
any further claim against the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of such amounts, and would be required
to claim such amounts from the Paying Agent in accordance with applicable insolvency laws.

Transfers of interests in the Notes will be effected between the NBB-SSS participants in accordance with
the rules and operating procedures of the NBB-SSS. Transfers between investors will be effected in
accordance with the respective rules and operating procedures of the NBB-SSS participants through
which they hold their Notes. The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Paying Agent will have no responsibility
for the proper performance by the NBB-SSS or the NBB-SSS participants of their obligations under their
respective rules and operating procedures. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

   - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the merits and risks
of investing in the Notes;

   - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have
on its overall investment portfolio;

   - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential
investor’s currency;

  - understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behavior of any relevant
indices and financial markets; and

   - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect their investment and their ability to bear
the applicable risks.

Potential investors should not invest in the Notes unless they have the expertise (either alone or with the
help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting
effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s
overall investment portfolio. The investment activities of investors are subject to applicable investment
laws and regulations and/or review or regulation by certain authorities and each potential investor should
consult its legal advisers or the appropriate regulators.

**Overview**

We are a leading international provider of personal hygiene solutions, with a focus and expertise in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care products. Our products are distributed in more than 110
countries, both through leading retailer brands and through our own brands such as bbTips, BioBaby,
Pompom, Bigfral, Canbebe, Canped, ID, Cremer, Affective, Chicolastic and Serenity. Headquartered in
Belgium, we manufacture and supply retailer brands, partner brands and our own Ontex brands in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care to consumers and customers in Europe, the Americas, the
Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia, and as of March 31, 2021 employed approximately 9,600 people
globally.

We primarily sell products to large retailers to be sold under their brands (“retailer brands”) and a range
of own-brand products under our proprietary labels (“Ontex brands”), with the mix between retailer
brand and Ontex brand sales varying by product category and geography. In Europe, we primarily sell our
products to retailers, manufacturing products to be sold under established retailer brands and helping
them to establish or enhance their own brands. We believe that we are the largest supplier of retailer
brand personal hygiene products in Europe by sales, with a market share we estimate to be around
double that of the second-largest supplier of retailer brands in the same region. We also sell Ontex brand
products to institutional and other customers (such as drugstores and specialty medical retailers), in
particular through our Healthcare division. Outside of Europe, our sales mix varies by geography and the
maturity of a given market. For instance, in North America we sell retailer brand products, and have also
begun to capitalize on shifts in consumer preference by partnering with third-party brands which are
mostly active in the lifestyle market (“third-party brands”); in selected other markets across the Americas,
the Middle East, Africa and Asia, we primarily sell Ontex brand products. We also sell a small amount of
finished products to other manufacturers, which is referred to as contract manufacturing. For the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, 52% and 54%
of our revenue was generated from retailer brands (including third-party brands and our contract
manufacturing activities), with the remaining 48% and 46% being generated from Ontex brands.

Our commercial activities are organized across three divisions, namely (i) Europe, (ii) Americas, Middle
East, Africa and Asia, and (iii) Healthcare:

  - Our Europe division is predominantly focused on the production and sale of retailer brands in
Western, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. Our contract
manufacturing activities also fall within this division. The Europe division accounted for 40.0% of
our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 41.8% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020;


-----

  - Our Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia (or “AMEAA”) division is predominantly focused on
the production, marketing and sales of our own local or regional brands, with the notable exception
of North America, where we primarily sell retailer brands and third-party brands. We conduct our
sales and marketing activities through dedicated teams in North America, Mexico and Central
America, South America, and the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The AMEEA division accounted for
37.3% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 37.1% of our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Our Healthcare division is focused on institutional customers (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes and
homecare channels) to which we sell Ontex expert brands and distributor brands. Marketing is
organized at the divisional level, with dedicated support at the area level. Sales activities in
Healthcare are split into three geographical areas: (i) Australia and New Zealand, (ii) France,
Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, Germany, the United Kingdom & Ireland and
distributors and (iii) Italy and Iberia. The Healthcare division accounted for 22.7% of our revenue
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 21.1% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

In addition, our operations activities (including our procurement, manufacturing, supply chain,
engineering, quality assurance and EH&S functions) are consolidated into our Group Supply function.
This centralized set-up ensures that we drive scale and productivity across our global operations, thanks
to our end-to-end ownership of the product lifecycle: the creation of the right products, at the right cost,
with the right materials and the right technologies, with a constant focus on product quality and safety.

Our core product categories include:

  - Baby Care, which includes baby diapers, baby pants and wet wipes. Baby Care products
accounted for 53% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 56% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Adult Incontinence, which comprises light, medium and heavy incontinence solutions for sale to
both retail and specialized (e.g. healthcare institutions and pharmacies) channels. Our Adult
Incontinence products include adult diapers, adult pants, pads and underpads. We also offer
continence care services to support healthcare institutions (e.g. Odobin). Adult Incontinence
products accounted for 35% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 33%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Feminine Care, which includes a range of products such as ultra-towels, fluff towels, panty liners
and tampons, sold through both retailer brands and our own Ontex brands. Through a broad range
of Feminine Care products, we are able to respond to the different needs and lifestyles of women.
All have innovative features that offer protection and comfort at all times and in a variety of
circumstances. Feminine Care products accounted for 10% of our revenue for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 10.2% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Other products, which comprise complementary personal hygiene products, including face masks,
gloves, body washes and skin care products. These are mostly traded products, purchased by us
from third parties and sold commercially. Other products accounted for 2% of our revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 1.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31,
2020.

We are headquartered in Erembodegem (Aalst), Belgium and have a well-balanced manufacturing and
sales footprint. We have 19 production facilities located across Europe (including two in Belgium, one in
the Czech Republic, one in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Poland, and one in Spain), Turkey,
Algeria, Russia, Australia, Pakistan, Ethiopia, two in Mexico, Brazil and the U.S. In the U.S., we are in the
process of expanding our operations with the construction of a new production facility in North-Carolina
where we also intend to commence baby diaper production in early 2022. We have 28 sales and
marketing sites globally, through which we make sales in more than 110 countries worldwide. The wide
reach of our production facilities and sales offices enables us to operate across a broad range of markets
in a cost-effective manner. We believe they also allow us to be the only hygiene manufacturing company
capable of effectively serving a range of increasingly international customers. We employed
approximately 9,600 full time equivalent employees as of March 31, 2021.

We enjoy deep and longstanding relationships with our top customers, which are primarily retailers and
third-party brand owners. In certain markets, our relationships with top customers date to our entry into


-----

that market, and are often decades in duration. We also benefit from a diversified customer base, with our
largest customer accounting for 5.9% of our revenue and our ten largest customers accounting for 33.0%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

By geographic market, for the year ended December 31, 2020, 47% of our revenue was attributable to
Western Europe, 12% to Eastern Europe, 28% to the Americas and 13% to the rest of the world.

During the period from 2015 through 2020, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.3%
(including the impact of acquisitions), with average organic revenue growth (i.e. growth at reported
currency, excluding the impact of acquisitions) of approximately 0.7% per year.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our revenue was €480 million, our EBITDA was €42 million
and our Adjusted EBITDA was €50 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue was
€2,087 million, our EBITDA was €198 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €236 million.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by many factors, some of which are
beyond our control. This section sets out certain key factors that we believe have affected our results of
operations in the periods under review and could affect our results of operations in the future. While the
factors described below have significantly influenced our results of operations during historical periods,
they may vary in importance from period to period. For a discussion of certain factors that may adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition, please see “Risk Factors”.

**_Market Dynamics_**

Our revenue is influenced both by growth of the overall market for hygienic disposable products, which is
in turn largely driven by demographic trends, including product adoption rates, and by growth in
penetration of retailer brands. Changes in the competitive landscape may also affect the penetration of
retailer brands as well as our market share within the retailer brand segment.

_Demographic Trends_

Demand for hygienic disposables is influenced by demographic trends in the markets in which we operate,
including population growth and trends in the adoption of our products. In the baby care market, demand
for our products is driven by the number of babies; in the adult incontinence market, demand is driven by
the size of the population over 45 years; and in the feminine care market, demand is driven by the size of
the female population aged 12 to 49 years. The adoption of our products is affected by factors such as
changes in GDP per capita, awareness of product availability, product innovation and other trends, such
as the average age of potty training and the number of people suffering from incontinence. The
geographic markets in which we operate have very different demographic profiles and are in different
stages in terms of the adoption of our products. For a detailed discussion of demographic trends in the
regions where we operate, see “Industry—Overview & Market Trends—Underlying Socio-demographic
_trends”._

Although the hygienic disposables market as a whole is resilient and generally not directly exposed to
economic cycles given the relatively non-discretionary nature of the products, the overall trend of adoption
of hygienic disposables in emerging markets may slow during economic downturns due to consumers’
price sensitivity. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continuing into 2021,
demand for our products across most markets was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the essential nature of our products, the combined impacts of governmental restrictions on
human activity and associated reduction in retail footfall, reduced out-of-home activity due to government
advice or restrictions, as well as significant and prolonged economic downturns in several of our
geographic markets, resulted in decreased demand for and delays in adoption of our products. However,
an increased focus on general health and wellbeing following the pandemic, in particular in relation to
elderly and vulnerable populations, may provide an opportunity to accelerate awareness of common
health issues and therefore drive increased adoption our products, such as adult incontinence products.
Additionally, a shift in consumer preference to lower-priced products as a result of uncertain economic
conditions in certain of our markets could benefit our competitive but affordable retailer brand and Ontex
brand product offerings.


-----

_Share of Retailer Brands_

Hygienic disposables are manufactured by branded product manufacturers, often well-known companies
with large-scale operations such as Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly Clark and Essity,
who produce, promote and sell products under their own names or brands, and retailer brand
manufacturers (certain of whom may also produce branded products) who produce products on behalf
of national and international retailers, who in turn promote and sell the products under their own brands
or labels. Our revenue is influenced by changes in the overall share of retailer brands in the market.

The overall share of retailer brands in the market, as well as our own market share, can be influenced by
factors such as trends in GDP growth, marketing and promotional activity and product innovation. While
the overall market for hygienic disposable products is resilient and benefits from a relative inelasticity of
demand, consumers may become more price sensitive during economic downturns, and may increasingly
buy retailer branded products, which are generally less expensive than branded products. For that reason,
competition from branded product manufacturers and other retailer brand manufacturers may increase
during economic downturns. For example, during economic downturns, branded product manufacturers
may increase their marketing and promotional activities (including by offering discounts on their products)
in order to preserve market share. Economic downturns can also result in lower overall consumption of
hygienic products, as occurred in 2020 and continued into 2021 when a combination of reduced out-ofhome activity and heightened economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in
many consumers postponing or limiting their purchases of such products.

Branded product manufacturers periodically introduce new products with various innovations to existing
products. Rapid time to market for comparable products is key to our competitiveness, both against
branded products and other manufacturers’ retailer brands that are introduced in response. Our revenue
is affected by our ability to develop and launch comparable new product innovations rapidly, and also by
our ability to introduce new innovations that will diversify and differentiate our product offering from that of
branded product manufacturers and other retailer brand manufacturers.

_Competitive Landscape_

Across the various divisions and geographies in which we operate, we compete with both branded product
manufacturers and other retailer brand manufacturers.

In Europe, the largest manufacturers of branded hygienic disposable products are Procter & Gamble,
Essity and Kimberly-Clark which sell brands such as Pampers, Always and Tampax (Procter & Gamble),
Tork and Lotus Baby (Essity), and Huggies and Intimus (Kimberly-Clark). According to Euromonitor and
management estimates, Procter & Gamble, Essity and Kimberly-Clark’s businesses had market shares
within the total hygienic disposables market in Europe (including both branded and retailer brand
businesses) of approximately 38%, 16% and 6%, respectively, based on value in 2020. Ontex had an
overall market share of 8%.

For further discussion of the competitive landscape in the various geographies in which we operate, see
“Industry—Analysis by Product Category and Geography”.

According to Euromonitor, the share of retailer brands within the overall market based on value in 2020
was 20% in Europe, 18% in the United States, 5% in Mexico and 1% in Brazil. The shares of retailer
brands based on Nielsen data (which measures the brick-and-mortar retail market only, and does not
account for online sales) were higher, representing 37% in Europe, 25% in the United States, 8% in
Mexico and 1% in Brazil. Within retailer brands in Europe, we estimate that we are the leading player, with
2.4 times the market share of our nearest competitor according to management estimates. We are also
the leading player in Mexico by a significant margin, according to Euromonitor and management
estimates, and hold a growing share in the United States.

**_Government Spending_**

Our Healthcare Division primarily sells Ontex branded products to public institutions. The method of
payment or reimbursement for the healthcare market for adult incontinence products varies by country.
However, it is typically a governmental body or health insurer who ultimately pays for the products and
contracts are generally granted by way of public tender. Accordingly, trends in government spending on
adult incontinence products will affect the share of our brands in the market. Due to reductions in budgets
by many European governments, public institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes may be required
to limit their expenditures, resulting in reductions or cancellations of reimbursement policies relating to


-----

these products. We believe that due to the necessity of our Adult Incontinence products, any reduction or
cancellation of payments or reimbursements for these products by governments or other parties will
result, over time, in an increase in sales of such products through retail channels. The timing of any such
impact and the degree to which the loss of revenue in our Healthcare Division will be compensated by
growth in revenue from retail channels is difficult to predict.

**_Business Relationships, Retention of Contracts and New Business Wins_**

Our revenue and cash flows are affected by our ability to retain existing business and generate new
business from existing and new customers. We enter into framework agreements with the majority of our
retail customers and distributors. These agreements are generally on a non-exclusive basis and contain,
in general, no minimum purchase obligations. These agreements typically do not have a fixed term, and
when they do, the term is generally one to two years. Some of these agreements are automatically
renewed or continue indefinitely, unless either party terminates. While we usually do not have long-term
contracts, we have enjoyed long-standing relationships with all of our top ten customers over the last
ten years. In certain markets, our relationships with top customers date to our entry into that market, and
are often decades in duration.

The terms on which we retain business directly affects our results of operations. While price is a key
factor, other factors influence our relationship with our customers, such as performance track record,
including product quality, product innovation, on-time service delivery and operational efficiency. The
overall quality of the relationship between us and our customers is important for business generation and
retention, and it can be leveraged to increase profitability.

In connection with new business wins or the expiration of contractual agreements, we are typically invited
to tender for a new contract with the customer, or to negotiate a new agreement with the customer.
Because of the generally flexible nature of these contractual arrangements, additional business depends
largely on the ongoing relationships with existing and potential customers. The factors that influence the
terms on which we retain business, and thereby affect our results, are the same factors that influence the
terms on which we win new business. The retention of our key customer base gives us a strong platform
from which to win new business. In particular, as major retailer customers expand into new markets and
the penetration of retailer brands grows in such markets, we are well positioned to accompany our
customers and expand our business.

We are also highly focused on ensuring profitability by customer and product, and this focus has informed
our efforts to win business from new and existing customers, more so than simply increasing sales
volume alone. This profit focus can in the short term periodically lead to customer losses, with a
consequential negative effect on revenue.

**_Cost of Raw Materials_**

Our results of operations are impacted by the prices we pay for the raw materials we use to manufacture
our products. Raw materials are the principal component of our cost of sales. Raw materials and
packaging costs accounted for 72% and 70%, respectively, of our cost of sales for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and the three months ended March 31, 2020. Traded goods accounted for 2% of
our cost of sales for each of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31,
2020.

The principal raw materials we use include:

  - Fluff, the common name for milled wood pulp, which is used in the absorbent core of hygienic
disposable products. Wood pulp, often bleached, is milled to separate the fibers into “fluff,” a
process which increases the pulp’s bulk. Fluff represented 17% and 18%, respectively, of our cost
of raw materials (including packaging) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year
ended December 31, 2020.

  - Super-absorber, which consists of a material which can absorb many times its own weight in
aqueous fluids. The majority of super-absorbers for the hygienic disposables market are
polyacrylates made from caustic soda and acrylic acid and are sold in granular form. Superabsorber represented 18% of our cost of raw materials (including packaging) for each of the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.

  - Non-woven fabrics, which are high-tech, engineered fabrics made from fibers used across a wide
range of applications in consumer and industrial products. A significant portion of non-woven


-----

fabrics used in the hygienic disposables market are made using polypropylene. Non-woven
products represented 24% of our cost of raw materials (including packaging) for each of the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020.

Other raw materials we use include tapes, polyethylene, adhesives, various packaging and other
materials. Most of our products contain polyethylene film, which is mainly used in back-sheets to prevent
leakage.

The prices we pay for raw materials can be highly variable, depending on a number of factors, including,
but not limited to, the following:

   - the availability of supply, including supplier capacity constraints;

   - general economic conditions globally and in particular markets;

   - fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, since certain chemicals used in our
raw materials, including polyethylene, propylene and polypropylene, are derived from crude oil;

  - fluctuations in exchange rates, since we make purchases of fluff products in U.S. Dollars. A
strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro would adversely affect our results of operations.
Purchases of oil-based raw materials referred to above also increase our exposure to the U.S.
Dollar, since the reference price for crude oil is U.S. Dollars;

   - whether, under the terms of the relevant supply agreement, the purchase price of a particular raw
material is linked to a price index, either for the raw material itself or one of its principal
components. Our supply contracts for fluff are typically linked to the RISI index; supply contracts
for super-absorber are typically linked to the index for propylene (propylene accounts for
approximately 30% of acrylic acid); supply contracts for polyethylene products are linked to the
index for low density polyethylene; and supply contracts for non-woven fabrics are linked to the
index for polypropylene. The indices for propylene, polyethylene and polypropylene are correlated
with the price of crude oil. We estimate that, at current commodity price levels, between 70% and
85% of our raw materials and packaging costs is directly linked to the evolution of commodities
indices. The remaining 15% to 30% is subject to general inflation, and can be influenced to a
greater degree by price negotiations;

   - whether the relevant supply agreement contains provisions that reduce our exposure to volatility
in raw materials prices (which is the case for certain of our fluff supply agreements) and whether
the purchase price is adjusted in advance or in arrears under the relevant supply agreement;

  - competing demand from other industries for the same raw materials; and

   - the availability of complementary and substitute materials.

Fluff pulp index prices varied during the three most recent fiscal years:

**FY2018** **% change** **FY2019** **% change** **FY2020**

RISI average in USD (per ton) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1301 _(6.6)_ $1215 _(4.4)_ $1161

RISI average in Euro (per ton) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €1103 _(1.6)_ €1085 _(6.1)_ €1019
Average price including rebates, in Euro (per ton) . . . € 574 _13.8_ € 653 _(9.2)_ € 593

Fluff pulp index prices have decreased from recent peaks due to good availability, however in USD terms
have strengthened. Our fluff costs increased in 2019 due to purchases of special fluff types and
certifications. These prices are based on the index for bleached kraft (untreated) fluff North America, CIF
North Sea Ports, expressed in ADMT (Air dry metric ton). We estimate that a 10% movement in the RISI
index translates into an approximately 5% impact on our gross margin (based on fluff elasticity to the
RISI index of 100% and certain other assumptions), before taking into account any arrangements we
have entered into with fluff suppliers to manage volatility or hedging arrangements.

Crude oil prices, to which pricing for super absorber and non-woven fabrics is linked, have experienced
significant volatility during the periods under review, averaging US$41.76, US$ 64.34, US$71.06 for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, based on the spot price for Brent crude.
Spot prices fell dramatically in early 2020, to a low of US$18.38 in 2020, as the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic and related restrictions on travel and trade resulted in reduced demand. Prices recovered
through the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, with an average price of US$60.82 for the three months


-----

ended March 31, 2021. We estimate that a 10% movement in the various petrochemicals indices to
which our raw materials prices are correlated would translate into an impact on our gross margin of
approximately 4%.

While we have been successful in compensating for increases in our raw material costs with adjustments
to the prices of our products, if we are unable to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers,
our profitability can be adversely affected. The majority of our customer contracts are based on fixed
pricing models and do not contain raw materials price indexation clauses, although we are increasingly
seeking to introduce these clauses into our contracts. In particular, we have sought to introduce “escalator”
clauses relating to oil-based products and currency movements in contracts with key customers. However,
we are not always successful in adding them.

We have also periodically sought to manage our raw materials costs through hedging, in particular the
price of oil or derivative products used in the manufacture of our products. For example, in 2020 we
entered into arrangements to hedge a portion of our propylene, polypropylene and polyethylene exposure.
We also maintain a hedging committee; see “—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market
_Risk—Hedging Committee”._

As noted above, our purchases of raw materials also entail foreign exchange risk, since we purchase fluff
in U.S. Dollars and the reference price for crude oil is U.S. Dollars. We entered into foreign exchange
forward contracts in 2020, the latest of which matures in April 2022, in order to limit the volatility in the
business resulting from exposure to sales and purchases in foreign currencies. Please see “—Foreign
_Exchange Rate Fluctuations” below for more detail of these arrangements._

In recent years we have implemented new capabilities such as “should-cost analytics,” to estimate our
suppliers’ costs, and in-depth market analytics, that together allow us to negotiate more favorable terms
in our purchases of raw materials and packaging. We work in close collaboration with our manufacturing
and R&D departments to implement our cost-saving measures and optimize our resource allocations.

**_Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_**

Currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a substantial impact on our results of operations. Our
main functional and reporting currency is the Euro, and we make substantial sales and purchases
denominated in other currencies, and have significant operations in, several countries that use other
currencies.

_Transactional Impact_

_Sales and purchases of raw materials in foreign currencies_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary using
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions are recognized in the income statement. Accordingly,
transactions in foreign currencies, including sales of our products denominated in foreign currencies and
purchases of raw materials in foreign currencies, directly affect our results of operations. Translations of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year-end exchange rates are also
recognized in the income statement.

We make substantial sales denominated in currencies other than Euros. In the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 54.1% and 52.7%, respectively,
of our revenue in currencies other than Euros, principally Mexican Pesos, Brazilian Reals, U.S. Dollars,
Pounds Sterling, Polish Zloty, Russian Roubles and Turkish Lira. The strengthening of these currencies
against the Euro will have a favorable impact on our results of operations, whereas the weakening of
these currencies will have an adverse impact.

We make purchases of certain raw materials, primarily fluff, in U.S. Dollars. U.S. Dollar-denominated fluff
purchases amounted to €201 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Purchases of oil-based raw
materials also indirectly increase our exposure to the U.S. Dollar, since the reference price for crude oil is
U.S. Dollars. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro will adversely affect our results of
operations.

The aggregate period-on-period impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our revenue was a negative
impact of €33.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and a negative impact of €130 million,
a positive impact of €11.1 million and a negative impact of €102 million in the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The impact across our divisions varies. For example, the impact in
2020 was concentrated in the Americas region. The aggregate impact of exchange rate fluctuations on
our Adjusted EBITDA was a negative impact of €10.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021
and a negative impact of €74.0 million, a negative impact of €15.7 million and a negative impact of
€26.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

_Finance income/(finance cost)_

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to interest-bearing debt and cash and cash equivalents
are presented in the income statement within “net exchange differences relating to financing activities”.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within “other operating
income/(expense), net”. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the net impact of exchange rate differences on our net finance
expense was negative €1.0 million, positive €0.5 million, negative €1.0 million and negative €1.2 million,
respectively. Exchange rate differences were primarily related to borrowings and cash balances
denominated in Euro in countries with a functional currency different from the Euro.

_Translation Impact_

We have significant operations in countries located outside the Eurozone. The functional currencies of
our subsidiaries in these countries are the relevant local currencies. For the purposes of presenting our
consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
closing foreign exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Items of income and expense are
translated at the average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses
are translated at the rate of the dates of the transactions), and equity items are translated at historical
rates. The resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in a separate component of equity. Accordingly, any such differences do not affect our
results of operations.

_Hedging_

We have a hedging committee in place, as described in detail in “—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure
_About Market Risk—Hedging Committee”. In accordance with the hedging policy developed by the_
hedging committee, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in 2020, maturing through
April 2022, in order to limit volatility in our business resulting from exposures to sales in Pounds Sterling,
Polish Zloty, Australian Dollars, Czech Crowns, U.S. Dollars, Mexican Pesos and Brazilian Reals, as well
as purchases of raw materials in U.S. Dollars and Czech Crowns.

At inception of the foreign exchange contracts, they were designated as cash flow hedges. At the time
the forecasted transactions materialize, the foreign exchange forward contracts become fair value hedges.
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the


-----

forecasted transactions. We apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts.
Accordingly, fluctuations in the value of our foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected in other
comprehensive income and do not directly impact our income statement. Please see “—Qualitative and
_Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk—Foreign Exchange Risk” for more detail on our foreign_
currency hedging arrangements.

**_Operational Productivity and Efficiency_**

Our profitability and competitiveness can be affected by the productivity and efficiency of our operations.
We have a history of implementing productivity and efficiency improvements on a continuous basis. We
will continue to focus on managing our business in a cost-effective manner through optimizing our
procurement and manufacturing operations. We have also in the past restructured our operations in
order to improve our production efficiency. For example, in 2019 we launched a comprehensive, datadriven organizational transformation initiative called Transform2Grow, or “T2G,” which aimed to accelerate
value creation through a focus on operational and commercial excellence. T2G touched every facet of
our business, as we reexamined each of our business processes for ways to innovate or increase
efficiencies.

In terms of direct cost savings in connection with our procurement activities, we have a diversified base
of raw material suppliers, thereby allowing us to benchmark our suppliers’ pricing broadly. Moreover, the
centralization of our procurement function allows us to benefit from our scale. T2G has also allowed us to
optimize our costs, translating business requirements into concrete initiatives such as reducing the weight
of raw materials, removing product features that do not add value, harmonizing standards and reducing
complexity.

This strategy has been supported by our investment in technologies that have enabled us to operate our
machines faster and in a more efficient and flexible manner. For example, we invested in the roll-out of a
manufacturing execution system (MES) and quality information system (QIS) which allow us to gather
and analyze data to guide the operations on efficiency. Our operations team is continuing to work together
to pool the collective knowledge of our executive operational managers at each of our production facilities
so that any advance or development utilized by a facility that leads to efficiencies is rolled out to our other
production facilities as soon as possible. This knowledge transfer is formally organized through two
technical meetings per year, where new ideas are presented and best practices are shared. Through our
T2G transformation initiatives, we have taken measures to enhance this knowledge sharing on a
day-to-day basis and further streamline our operations by, among other things, bringing together our
Supply Chain and Manufacturing functions, enabling them to work as one effective and agile unit. This
integrated, hands-on approach will result in better levels of service for our customers. We also integrated
the majority of our change agents (people who build capability) into key leadership roles in Manufacturing
and Supply Chain.

In terms of direct cost savings focused on distribution expenses, we have sought to improve prices with
our transport providers and have initiated changes to our warehousing and inventory policies, with a
focus on inventory reduction and further consolidation of external warehouses lower costs. We have both
negotiated with our existing transport providers and diversified the number of our providers to achieve
more favorable terms, and effected changes to product design elements to reduce product weight,
optimize cargo unit palletization and improve truck fill factors, all of which help to reduce transportation
costs. In respect of warehousing costs, we have increased our use of third-party warehousing
arrangements, whereby we pay by cargo unit as opposed to renting or owning floor space, thereby
decreasing fixed costs.

In addition to these cost savings initiatives launched by our previous management, our new leadership, in
place since the arrival of our new CEO Esther Berrozpe, has engaged in a detailed strategic review in
order to further drive operational productivity and cost savings. We are in the process of implementing a
combination of efficiency initiatives targeting, among other things, operational productivity gains,
increases in capacity utilization and a reduction in overhead costs, which together we believe will result in
a significant positive impact to the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA margin.

As a result of our cost savings initiatives, and in light of our current strategic objectives and business
model, we do not expect our general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses to
increase significantly in the medium term as a percentage of our revenues.


-----

**_Mix of Revenues and Effect on Margins_**

The principal factors affecting our margins, as described in further detail above, are raw materials prices
and exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to pass these on to customers or manage them through
hedging. As our margins also vary across products, geographies, divisions and customers, our results of
operations are also influenced by our mix of revenues.

In particular, our margins vary from country to country primarily due to: (i) the length of our presence in a
country; (ii) the relative level of competition; (iii) whether the business is weighted toward retailer branded
or branded products; and (iv) the distribution model. When we first enter a country, we incur certain
start-up costs and typically have relatively low volumes to absorb fixed costs, which may result in margins
being lower than those of countries in which we have a longstanding presence. As we increase the level
of sales in a country, our margins generally improve. As a result, we do not expect the expected increase
in sales in such countries as a percentage of our total sales to weigh heavily on our overall gross margin
going forward. Also, our margins are typically lower when we are shipping into (rather than producing in)
a country due to the higher transportation costs and the payment of import duties. Our margins may also
vary from country to country due to the relative level of competition. The higher level of sales and
marketing expenses associated with branded products may also affect our margins for a particular
country. The nature of our distribution model also affects our gross margin. In particular, in our Healthcare
Division, our gross margin is significantly higher than for our other divisions because a greater proportion
of the cost base is included in distribution expenses and sales and marketing expenses instead of cost of
sales. This is particularly true in relation to businesses with a high proportion of home delivery, where
sales prices and thus gross margins are higher to cover higher distribution costs.

Across divisions, our margins are also affected by product improvements and innovations as well as the
introduction of new products within a particular product category. Premium products may allow us to
charge our customers higher prices. In addition, product innovations, in particular changes to product
specifications that improve our operational efficiency and optimize our cost base, may have a favorable
effect on our margins to the extent they require fewer or less expensive raw materials to produce. Finally,
actions taken by branded competitors, such as entry into new areas or targeted price reductions, can
affect our margins.

**_Income Tax_**

Our income tax expense is affected by the statutory rate and the way in which the tax base is computed
in the various countries in which we operate (including pursuant to tax rulings and other arrangements
that we may agree from time to time with the competent tax authorities), the geographical mix of our
operations, the ability to deduct net financing costs in the legal entities in which such net expenses fall,
and our ability to use tax losses and credits or to recognize deferred tax assets on such losses and
credits, among other factors. The Group has tax losses and other tax incentives usable to offset future
taxable profits, mainly in Belgium, Brazil, France and Spain, amounting to €557.3 million as of
December 31, 2020 (€583.0 million as of December 31, 2019).

The rate at which we are able to use our tax losses and tax credits to offset future taxable profits may be
affected by changes in how the tax base is computed in various jurisdictions, changes in rules relating to
the utilization of tax losses or tax credits and tax rulings we receive from the competent tax authorities.

**Recent Developments**

**_Full-Year 2021 Outlook_**

_The below information is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational_
_results for the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2021. The statements and figures contained_
_herein were prepared based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent_
_uncertainties and subject to change. Accordingly, our actual results for the three and six-month periods_
_ending June 30, 2021 may vary from our preliminary estimates below, and such variations could be_
_material. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain_
_of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._

We currently expect stable full-year revenue on a like-for-like basis, with revenue growth beginning in the
second quarter and the first benefits of selective pricing investments in Europe and retailer brand contract
wins in Europe and North America expected later in 2021. We are observing short-term pressure on


-----

margins due to the expected effects of significant increases and continued volatility in commodity prices
translating into peak raw material costs. Despite strong initial results from cost-saving programs (with
which we target net savings of approximately €60 million in 2021) and other initiatives intended to mitigate
a portion of our cost inflation, which helped to partially offset these effects, we expect our Adjusted
EBITDA margin for the second quarter of 2021 to be slightly below that of the first quarter of 2021. The
implementation of strategic decisions is expected to result in non-recurring expenses of approximately
€55 million, to be recorded in 2021 (including €40 million in connection with our cost saving initiatives).

**Key Components of our Income Statement**

The key components of certain line items of our consolidated income statement are described below.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the amounts received or receivable from the sale of our products. Revenue is
presented net of VAT, product returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating intragroup sales.

Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products to the customer and its acceptance thereof. This
means that at that time, the following criteria are met: we cease to exercise ownership over the products
sold, we cease to have effective control over the products sold, and collection of the products sold is
reasonably assured. The Group sells its products to its customers directly, through distributors or agents.
This can result affect the timing of revenue recognition. Following delivery to distributors, the distributor
has full discretion over the manner of distribution and pricing of the goods, has the primary responsibility
when selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.

Products are generally sold to customers on an ex-works basis; however, at their request, additional
services may be offered by us in expediting delivery to customer premises or warehouses. The price for
our products generally reflects an amount of delivery expenses incurred by us. Revenue thereby reflects
this component, while related charges are included in distribution expenses.

Our customer contracts may include trade discounts or volume rebates, which are granted to the customer
if the delivered quantities exceed a certain threshold. In these cases, the transaction price includes a
variable consideration. The effect of the variable consideration on the transaction price is taken into
account in revenue recognition by estimating the probability of the realization of the discount or rebate
for each contract. Furthermore, the estimated variable consideration is included in the transaction price
only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue
recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently
resolved (constraining the variable consideration). Furthermore, the Group considers all payments made
to customers and whether these are related to the revenue generated from the customer.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration
is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents expenses incurred by us in connection with the manufacture of our products.
Raw material purchases are the principal expenses recognized in cost of sales. Other expenses
recognized in cost of sales include packaging costs, maintenance expenses, utility bills and conversion
costs, as well as production-related labor costs.

We recognize in our cost of sales the depreciation expenses that are directly attributable to the production
of the products.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Operating expenses include distribution expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general
administrative expenses, as well as foreign exchange differences on operating activities due to changes
in exchange rates on settled transactions.

**_Distribution Expenses_**

Distribution expenses are the principal component of our operating expenses and represent the cost
relating to the shipping of finished products to the customer. Distribution expenses include transport
costs, warehousing costs, costs in support of customer service and related labor costs.


-----

Product delivery costs are recorded under distribution expenses but, as noted above, are also generally
reflected in the price of our products.

We recognize in our distribution expenses the depreciation and amortization expenses that are directly
attributable to the distribution chain.

**_Sales and Marketing Expenses_**

Our sales and marketing expenses represent costs in connection with sales of our products, including
promotional giveaways. In the AMEAA division, as well as in our Healthcare Division, sales and marketing
expenses are also incurred in connection with brand support in relation to our branded products. Sales
and marketing expenses include sales commissions, fees for market research, advertising expenses,
publication costs, samples costs, exhibition costs and the labor costs of our sales teams and sales
back-office. We also recognize in our sales and marketing expenses the depreciation and amortization
expenses that are directly attributable to sales and marketing activities.

**_General Administrative Expenses_**

Our general administrative expenses represent the costs of our headquarters and the central divisional
management teams, including salaries and performance-based compensation. The headquarters
expenses and the costs of our central management team include, but are not limited to, support services
for our production facilities, such as system contracts for our IT systems as well as audit fees, legal fees
and other expenses. The management team of the Ontex group together with the central team oversee
purchasing, R&D, planning and logistics, manufacturing, sales as well as the legal and finance functions
and related risks.

**_Other Operating Income/Expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses are presented as a net amount and primarily represent gains or
losses on the sale of assets, foreign exchange differences on operating activities and other expenses.

**_Income and Expenses Related to Changes in Group Structure_**

Income and Expenses Related to Changes in Group Structure include income and charges that we
consider to be of a one-off and non-recurring nature. These include costs relating to manufacturing
facility closures, business restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and the setting up and moving of
certain production facilities.

**_Income and Expenses Related to Impairments and Major Litigations_**

Income and Expenses Related to Impairments and Major Litigations include income and charges that we
consider to be of a one-off and non-recurring nature. These include costs relating to asset impairment
and legal fees in the context of certain ongoing or potential litigation matters, which are expected to result
in a potential benefit for the Company or in the avoidance of potential future liabilities.

**_Net Finance Cost_**

Net finance cost comprises our finance costs, net of finance income.

Our finance costs primarily represent the interest paid by us or accrued on our financial debt. The
transaction costs related to the issuance of a financial liability are as a general matter initially deducted
from the proceeds of the financial liability and subsequently recognized as interest cost over the period of
the liability.

Our finance income primarily represents interest received on our short-term deposits, as well as any
gains on derivatives and derecognition of loans and receivables and financial liabilities carried at
amortized costs.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The current
income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end
of the reporting period in the countries where our subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

**_Non-IFRS Measures_**

EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow are presented
to enhance a prospective investor’s understanding of our results of operations and financial condition.
We define EBITDA as earnings before net finance cost, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We
define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenue. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before
non-recurring income and expenses. Non-recurring income and expenses are defined as those items
that are considered by management not to relate to transactions, projects and adjustments to the value of
assets and liabilities taking place in the ordinary course of activities of the Company. Non-recurring
income and expenses are presented separately, due to their size or nature, so as to allow users of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company to get a better understanding of the normalized
performance of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses for the periods under review include
acquisition-related expenses; changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context
of business combinations; changes to the Group structure, business restructuring costs, including costs
related to the liquidation of subsidiaries and the closure, opening or relocations of factories; and
impairment of assets and major litigations. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue. We define free cash flow as net cash generated from operating activities (as
presented in the consolidated cash flow statement, i.e. including income taxes paid), less capital
expenditures (defined as purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets), less
repayment of lease liabilities and including cash (used in)/from disposal. These measures have been
included in this Offering Memorandum because they are measures that our management uses to assess
our operating performance. Please see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” for information
on the limitations of these measures as analytical tools. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
and free cash flow to operating profit, please see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information
_and Other Data—Reconciliations of Non-IFRS Financial Measures”._

**Revenue**

Revenue decreased by €94.5 million, or 16.5%, from €574.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020 to €479.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a like-for-like (“LFL”) basis, which
we define as revenue at constant currency excluding change in scope of consolidation or M&A, revenue
decreased by 11.1%. Foreign currency effects were unfavorable, mainly due to the depreciation versus
the first quarter of 2020 of several key currencies against the euro, notably the Brazilian Real, Mexican
Peso, Turkish Lira and Russian Rouble. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a
particularly strong prior-year comparison period, combined with lower demand for personal hygiene
products in tracked retail channels and certain contract losses in Europe.

**_Revenue by Product_**

Note:

(1) Other products comprise a range of traded products purchased by us and sold commercially including cosmetics, medical
gloves, face masks and other traded products.

Revenue from Baby Care products decreased by €74.2 million, or 22.6%, from €328.3 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €254.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a
like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue decreased by 15.9% as a result of lower demand relative to a particularly
strong first quarter of 2020 due to impending COVID-19 restrictions and certain customer contract losses
in Europe, while AMEAA revenue was also lower versus a particularly strong first quarter of 2020.

Revenue from Adult Incontinence products decreased by €7.3 million, or 4.1%, from €177.1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €169.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
On a like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenues from Adult Incontinence products increased by 1.3%. The
decrease in revenue for the period can be primarily attributed to lower sales through institutional channels
as a result of reduced occupancy rates in care homes, partially offset by higher sales in self pay channels.

Revenue from Feminine Care products decreased by €14.7 million, or 23.7%, from €62.0 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €47.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a
like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue decreased by 26.8% versus a particularly strong first quarter of 2020
due to impending COVID-19 restrictions, both in Europe, where we generate the majority of our Feminine
Care sales, and the AMEAA division.

-----

Revenue from the Europe Division decreased by €58.4 million, or 23.4%, from €250.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €191.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a
like-for-like basis, revenues decreased by 21.5%. This decrease has two main drivers: the comparison to
a strong first quarter of 2020, during which we benefited from a significant surge in demand (in particular
in March 2020 as lockdowns were announced), and a net loss in customer contracts year-on-year. In
addition, revenue was negatively impacted by the continued shift in sales of personal hygiene products to
online channels, where our retailer brand products are less represented, partially offset by strong sales
growth in Russia.

Revenue from the AMEAA Division decreased by €34.6 million, or 16.2%, from €213.5 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €178.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a
like-for-like basis, revenues decreased by 4.2%. Year-on-year revenues were negatively impacted by the
exceptionally strong demand experienced in the first quarter of 2020 and by lower sales in the Middle
East, Africa and Australia regions, partially offset by revenue growth in markets such as Brazil and Turkey.

Revenue from the Healthcare Division decreased by €1.5 million, or 1.4%, from €110.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €109.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. On a
like-for-like basis, revenue decreased by 1.2%. This decrease was due to lower occupancy rates in care
homes across a number of markets and destocking of inventory built up in the U.K. in 2020 due to Brexit
uncertainty, partially offset by a strong revenue performance in e-commerce, self-pay channels and new

The following table sets forth revenue and the percentage change in revenue by geography for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020:

**Three months ended**

(1) Rest of world comprises revenues from our operations in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia.

Revenue from Western Europe decreased by €51.8 million, or 18.9%, from €274.8 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €223.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The
decrease was mainly due to the impact of extraordinary demand in the first quarter of 2020, as well as
certain contract losses in Europe year-over-year. On a like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue decreased by
18.9%.

Revenue from Eastern Europe decreased by €5.8 million, or 9.2%, from €63.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €57.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Revenues were
negatively impacted by devaluations in certain local currencies (in particular the Polish Zloty and Russian
Rouble) relative to the Euro. On a like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue remained stable, rising by 0.2%.

Revenue from the Americas decreased by €21.7 million, or 13.6%, from €160.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €138.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
Revenues were negatively impacted by devaluations in certain local currencies (in particular the Mexican
Peso and Brazilian Real) relative to the Euro. On a like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue decreased by 2.4%.

Revenue from the rest of the world decreased by €15.2 million, or 20.0%, from €76.0 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €60.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The
decrease in rest of world was primarily attributable to devaluations in certain local currencies (in particular
the Turkish Lira and the Algerian Dinar) relative to the Euro, as well as lower sales in certain specific
countries, including Australia. On a like-for-like (LFL) basis, revenue decreased by 10.8%.


-----

**Cost of Sales**

Cost of sales decreased by €57.7 million, or 14.4%, from €401.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €344.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Cost of sales represented
71.7% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to 70.0% for the
three months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting a gross margin of 28.3% and 30.0%, respectively. The
decrease in gross margin was driven by lower pricing (mainly in Europe and in our Healthcare division),
a negative product mix and lower volumes, only partially offset by efficiency gains. Our raw materials
costs were slightly lower in the first quarter of 2021 versus the comparable period in 2020; increases in
commodity indices in 2021 are not reflected in our results for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as
we are able to exhaust inventories of raw materials purchased in prior periods and pricing increases in
our raw materials generally lag increases in broader commodity indexes.

**Distribution Expenses**

Distribution expenses decreased by €4.0 million, or 7.6%, from €51.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €47.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Distribution expenses
represented 9.9% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to 8.9% for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to lower
volumes sold. The increase in percentage terms was due to a strong comparable period in 2020 (with
high volumes shipped while inventories and related storage costs remained low) versus the first quarter
of 2021, when distribution expenses as percentage of sales increased due to higher transport costs
resulting from, among other things, container shortages on the international market and Brexit-related
costs.

**Sales and Marketing Expenses**

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by €11.3 million, or 23.8%, from €47.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €36.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Sales
and marketing expenses represented 7.6% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to 8.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in sales and marketing
expenses was primarily due to cost-saving measures, reduced marketing expenditure and the devaluation
of local currencies year-over-year which resulted in lower relative spend in Euro.

**General Administrative Expenses**

General administrative expenses decreased by €1.1 million, or 4.6%, from €24.0 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €22.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. General
administrative expenses represented 4.8% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to 4.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in general administrative
expenses was due to the implementation of organizational cost-saving measures.

**Net Other Operating Income/(Expense)**

Net other operating income/(expense) was an expense of €5.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, compared to an expense of €1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
The decrease in net operating expense was attributable primarily to lower currency revaluation losses on
trade receivables and payables versus the first quarter of 2020.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA decreased by €17.3 million, or 29.1%, from €59.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020 to €42.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Our EBITDA margin was 8.8% for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to 10.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €16.4 million, or 24.9%, from €66.0 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €49.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Our Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 10.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to 11.5% for the three months
ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due to lower volumes versus the strong
prior-year comparative period, as well as a negative product pricing mix and €10.2 million in unfavorable
currency effects, which were only partially offset by savings in operational and overhead costs. Negative
currency impacts were primarily from the Brazilian Real, Russian Rouble, Turkish Lira, Pound Sterling
and Polish Zloty, partially offset by favorable impacts from the Czech Crown and Mexican Peso.

**Income and Expenses Relating to Changes to Group Structure**

Expenses relating to changes to group structure increased by €1.3 million, from €5.3 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. In the
three months ended March 31, 2021, these expenses primarily related to restructuring expenses for the
re-allocation of production capacity and the commencement of a strategic review of the geographical
footprint of the Group. Following this review, the Company decided to downsize some production capacity,
resulting in the recognition of a restructuring provision. In the three months ended March 31, 2020, these
expenses related to the Group’s reorganization and comprehensive transformation plan, T2G, and related
to in-depth assessments of our operational and commercial processes and the commencement of certain
projects intended to increase operational efficiency.

**Income and Expenses Relating to Impairments and Major Litigations**

Expenses relating to impairments and major litigations decreased by €0.5 million from €1.3 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 to €0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These
expenses primarily relate to impairments recognized on intangible assets in the three months ended
March 31, 2021, and primarily related to costs incurred in the context of certain ongoing litigation in the
three months ended March 31, 2020.

**Net Finance Costs**

Net finance costs increased by €3.5 million, or 56.5%, from €6.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 to €9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in net finance
costs was primarily due to negative currency revaluations on foreign bank accounts in the first quarter of
2021 (relative to favorable currency revaluations in the first quarter of 2020).

**Income Tax**

Income tax decreased by €4.2 million, or 58.3%, from €7.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020 to €3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in the effective tax
rate from 23.0% to 27.7%. The higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 was due to lower
profitability and the resulting partial write-off of a previously recognized deferred tax asset in respect of
certain tax losses.

**Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019**

The following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019 as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020:

**Revenue**

Revenue decreased by €194.5 million, or 8.5%, from €2,281.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to €2,086.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in revenue was primarily
due to lower demand for personal hygiene products in traditional retail channels and the negative impact
of contract losses in Europe, partially offset by resilient performance in our Healthcare division, growth in
Brazil, Turkey and the U.S. Our revenues in 2020 also reflected a €130 negative currency effect due to the
depreciation of several key functional currencies against the Euro. At constant currency, revenue
decreased by 3.1%. On a divisional basis, we experienced absolute revenue declines of 8.9% and 12.3%,
respectively, in the Europe and AMEAA Divisions, while revenues in our Healthcare Division remained
stable. Our branded business saw declines of 10.3%, and represented 46.5% of overall revenue in 2020,
as compared to 47.4% in 2019.

Revenue from Baby Care products decreased by €183.2 million, or 13.6%, from €1,345.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,162.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant
currency, revenue from Baby Care products decreased by 7.1%. After a strong surge at the end of the
first quarter triggered by increased demand at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for Baby
Care products contracted in retail channels and accelerated in online channels as consumer purchase
habits shifted during the pandemic. We also experienced net contract losses in Europe in 2020. Demand
in several emerging markets decreased due to the economic downturn, outweighing growth in Brazil and
the U.S.

Revenue from Adult Incontinence products decreased by €12.5 million, or 1.8%, from €692.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €679.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant
currency, revenue from Adult Incontinence products increased by 3.3%. The like-for-like increase in
revenues from Adult Incontinence products was primarily due to strong sales in retail channels (in
particular through retailer brands in Europe) as well as strong Ontex brand sales in Brazil, Mexico and
Turkey. In our Healthcare division, growth in self-pay channels, home delivery and e-commerce offset
lower activity with hospitals and nursing homes due to lower occupancy as a result of the pandemic.

Revenue from Feminine Care products decreased by €0.5 million, or 0.2%, from €212.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €212.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant
currency and excluding the impact of the acquisition of Albaad’s feminine hygiene business in the U.S. in
July 2020, revenue from Feminine Care products decreased by 1.5%. The decrease was primarily
attributable to decreased revenue in Europe, due to lower in-store demand for retailer brands and net
contract losses, which outweighed revenue growth in the AMEAA division in the first half of 2020.

**_Revenue by Division_**

The following table sets forth revenue and the percentage change in revenue by division for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

(1) 2019 revenues for the Healthcare and AMEAA divisions are shown as reported in our consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2020, and have been restated to reflect the effect of a shift in responsibility for one customer
from our AMEAA division to our Healthcare division, effective January 1, 2020. This resulted in a decrease in AMEAA revenues
of €9.1 million, and a corresponding increase in Healthcare revenues of €9.1 million, for 2019, versus the amounts reported
in our financial statements for 2019. Overall 2019 revenues are unchanged.

Revenue from the Europe Division decreased by €84.7 million, or 8.9%, from €956.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €872.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant currency,
revenue decreased by 6.8%. The decrease in revenues in Europe was primarily due to decreased
demand from retail customers beginning in the second quarter, as well as net contract losses in Europe,
only partially offset by sales growth in Adult Incontinence products and strong growth in our online baby
diaper subscription service. Sales of retailer brands were impacted by increasing online sales, where
retailer brands are less present, and by intensified competition from A-brands.

Revenue from the AMEAA Division decreased by €108.8 million, or 12.3%, from €882.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €774.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant
currency, revenue decreased by 0.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, entirely in Baby
Care products, partially offset by a favorable pricing mix. Revenue in the Americas rose due to growth in
Brazil and the U.S., while sales declined in Mexico as a result of adverse economic conditions during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Sales also decreased in the Middle East, Africa and Australia, as a strong
performance in Turkey could not offset lower sales in other geographies, many of which faced lower
demand due to economic downturns, extended store closures and heightened competitive pressure.

Revenue from the Healthcare Division decreased slightly by €1.1 million, or 0.2%, from €441.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €440.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant


-----

currency, revenue in Healthcare was in line with the prior year, increasing by 0.1%. This was mainly due
to market share gains in fast-growing self-pay channels, as well as strong home delivery and ecommerce
activity boosted by lockdown measures, partially offset by lower demand from hospitals and nursing
homes, whose occupation rates were strongly impacted by the pandemic.

(1) Rest of world comprises revenues from our operations in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia.

Revenue from Western Europe decreased by €44.5 million, or 4.3%, from €1,027.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €983.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to the impact of net contract losses and lower demand from retailers in Western Europe,
partially offset by strong performance with Healthcare customers. At constant currency, like-for-like
revenue from Western Europe decreased by 4.0%.

Revenue from Eastern Europe decreased by €25.9 million, or 9.4%, from €276.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. At constant currency,
revenue from Eastern Europe decreased by 3.4%. The decline in revenue was driven by lower demand
from retailers in Eastern Europe. Poland and Russia together accounted for 78.8% of revenue in Eastern
Europe in 2020, compared to 80.9% in 2019.

Revenue from the Americas decreased by €74.9 million, or 11.2%, from €667.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €592.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily
due to the impact of the devaluation of certain local currencies (in particular the Mexican Peso and
Brazilian Real) relative to the Euro and decreased sales in Mexico due to adverse economic conditions,
partially offset by increased revenues in North America. At constant currency, revenue from the Americas
increased by 1.0%.

Revenue from the rest of the world decreased by €49.1 million, or 15.9%, from €309.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €260.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to soft demand in several emerging markets due to economic downturns. At constant
currency, revenue from the rest of the world decreased by 8.6%. The top three countries in the rest of the
world region—Turkey, Australia and Algeria—accounted for 61.3% of revenue for the region in 2020.

**Cost of Sales**

Cost of sales decreased by €183.6 million, or 11.1%, from €1,661.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €1,477.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in overall
cost of sales was primarily due to lower volumes sold as compared with the comparable prior year period.
Cost of sales represented 70.8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to
72.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a gross margin of 29.2% and 27.2%,
respectively. This increase in gross margin was attributable to savings in procurement costs, in particular
as a result of lower raw materials cost, partially offset by the depreciation of certain of our functional
currencies versus the U.S. Dollar and lower volumes which negatively impacted operating leverage.

**Distribution Expenses**

Distribution expenses decreased by €8.8 million, or 4.3%, from €203.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €194.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Distribution expenses


-----

represented 9.3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 8.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due lower volumes sold
as compared with the prior year period. The increase in distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue
was mainly due to an unfavorable sales mix—characterized by a higher proportion of sales in Healthcare
(e.g. home delivery services) and e-commerce and lower sales to retailers—as well as higher
transportation costs.

**Sales and Marketing Expenses**

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by €2.3 million, or 1.4%, from €168.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales and marketing
expenses represented 8.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 7.4%
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily
due to the devaluation of certain lower currencies which resulted in a lower relative spend in Euros, while
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of our revenue was attributable to a
relative sharper decrease in revenues for the period than in sales and marketing expenses for the same
period.

**General Administrative Expenses**

General administrative expenses increased by €0.8 million, or 0.9%, from €90.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. General administrative
expenses represented 4.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.0%
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general administrative expenses was primarily
due to the inflation of costs and investment in IT resources, partially offset by our implementation of
cost-saving projects at the end of 2020.

**Net Other Operating Income/(Expense)**

Net other operating expense increased by €8.0 million, from an expense of €0.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to an expense of €8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase was attributable primarily to foreign exchange losses.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA increased by €22.9 million, or 13.1%, from €174.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our EBITDA margin was 9.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared to 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in
EBITDA was primarily due to lower non-recurring & restructuring costs in 2020 as compared to 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €9.5 million, or 3.9%, from €245.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 11.3% in 2020, compared to 10.7% in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2020 benefited from strong procurement savings and lower raw material costs, but these
benefits were outweighed by the combined impact of lower sales and operating leverage, cost inflation,
€14 million in COVID-19 related costs and a €74 million unfavorable currency effect.

**Income and Expenses Relating to Changes to Group Structure**

Expenses relating to changes to Group structure decreased by €33.4 million, from €58.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 to €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year
ended December 31, 2020, these expenses primarily related to the restructuring expenses in connection
with the re-allocation of certain production capacity and the commencement of a strategic review of the
geographical footprint of the Group. commencement of a strategic review of the geographical footprint of
the Group. Following this review, the Company decided to downsize some production capacity, resulting
in the recognition of a restructuring provision of €5.0 million. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2020
the Group announced an in-depth review of its overhead cost structure, and the expenses incurred in
2020 primarily relate to the start of this review (€ 12.7 million). In the year ended December 31, 2019,
these expenses primarily related to the Group reorganization and comprehensive transformation plan,
T2G, and related to in-depth assessments of our operational and commercial processes and the
commencement of certain projects intended to increase operational efficiency.

**Income and Expenses Relating to Impairments and Major Litigations**

Expenses relating to impairments and major litigations increased by €0.9 million from €11.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €12.4 million for year ended December 31, 2020. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, these expenses primarily related to impairment losses on idle machinery and
legal fees in connection with certain ongoing or potential litigation matters. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, these expenses primarily related to the impairment of assets as a result of the
transfer of our manufacturing operations in Aparecida de Goiânia in Brazil to our manufacturing site in
Senador Canedo.

**Operating Profit**

Operating profit increased by €23.7 million, or 27.2%, from €87.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to €110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our operating margin was 5.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Net Finance Costs**

Net finance costs decreased by €2.0 million, or 5.3%, from €37.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to €35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in net finance costs was
primarily due to currency impacts related to interest expense on debt denominated in local currencies.

**Income Tax**

Income tax increased by €9.1 million, or 74.6%, from €12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
to €21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the increase in
our profit before income tax. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 28.3%.
Our tax charge in 2019 was affected by tax incentives received in respect of certain industrial investments.

**(Loss)/Profit for the Year**

Profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €37.3 million, and profit for the year ended
December 31, 2020 was €54.0 million.

Revenue decreased by €10.9 million, or 0.5%, from €2,292.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to €2,281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency, revenue decreased
by 1.0%. The decrease was due to a decrease in volumes sold, largely offset by a favorable product and
price mix in each division and across all three product lines. In geographical terms, we experienced
strong revenue growth in markets such as Turkey, Mexico and Brazil as a result of price increases, while
revenues decreased in France, Germany, Poland and other European countries primarily as a result of a
contract with retailers lost in 2018 (and impacting revenue in 2019). On a divisional basis, we saw strong
year-over-year performance in the AMEAA division (increasing 6.7%), which only partially compensated
for lower sales in our Europe division (which declined by 6.3%) and a slight decline in Healthcare revenues
in 2019. We continued to grow our branded business, which represented 47.4% of revenue in 2019, as
compared to 46.1% in 2018.

Revenue from Baby Care products remained stable, increasing by €0.6 million from €1,345.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,345.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant
currency, revenue from Baby Care products decreased by 0.9% due to lower volumes, in particular of
retailer brand products in Europe. This decrease was partially offset by recoveries in volumes in Baby
Care products and in European retailer brands in the second half of the year.

Revenue from Adult Incontinence care products decreased by €1.6 million, or 0.2%, from €693.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €692.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At
constant currency, revenue from Adult Incontinence care products increased slightly by 0.1%. In retail
channels, revenue grew by 2%, with a sales increase of Ontex brands in developing markets only partially
offset by lower sales of retailer brands in Europe. Revenue in institutional channels decreased slightly
relative to a strong 2018 in spite of increased demand for adult pants which experienced sales increases
in both retail and institutional channels.

Revenue from Feminine Care products decreased by €10.1 million, or 4.5%, from €222.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018 to €212.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant
currency, revenue from Feminine Care products decreased by 5.0%. Our Europe division record lower
sales of retailer brands, which comprise the largest contributor to category revenue, while Ontex brands
and sales to third-party brand customers posted growth in the AMEAA division.

(1) For ease of comparison, we present 2019 revenues as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Accordingly, 2019 revenues as presented in this table do not reflect the effect of a shift in responsibility
for one customer from our AMEAA division to our Healthcare division, as effective January 1, 2020 and subsequently restated
in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. This restatement would result in decreases
in AMEAA revenues (and corresponding increases in Healthcare revenues) of €9.1 million and €8.1 million for 2019 and
2018, respectively. Overall revenues for 2019 and 2018 are unchanged.


-----

Revenue from the Europe Division decreased by €63.8 million, or 6.3%, from €1,020.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €956.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency,
revenue in the Europe Division decreased by 6.4%. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes as
a result of contracts lost in 2018, which had an impact on revenue in 2019 in several European countries,
most notably in France, Poland, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium. However, sales trends
improved in the second half of 2019, reflecting measures undertaken to improve execution and organic
revenue growth, including the replacement of our Europe leadership team, improvements to our sales
and operations planning processes and the opening of a new plant in Poland to better serve the needs of
customers in Central and Eastern Europe.

Revenue from the AMEAA Division increased by €56.1 million, or 6.7%, from €835.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €891.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency,
revenue increased by 5.6%. The increase was primarily due to increased volumes as well as a year-overyear improvement in product and price mix, including strong demand for Ontex brand baby diapers and
light Adult Incontinence products in Brazil (Cremer, Pompom and Moviment) and Mexico (bbtips and
Chicoclastic). Revenue increased in the US on the back of growing third-party brand and retailer brand
volumes. Revenue also grew in the Middle East, Africa and Asia due to increased demand for Ontex
brand Baby Care and Adult Incontinence products, in spite of challenging political and economic
environments in certain markets, including a partial recovery of sales in Turkey.

Revenue from the Healthcare Division decreased by €3.1 million, or 0.7%, from €435.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018 to €432.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant
currency, revenue decreased by 0.8%. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales to institutional
customers, the result of budget constraints and decreasing public healthcare spending, and also reflected
elevated raw material prices during the period. We were able to partially offset raw materials costs in our
product pricing.

Revenue from Western Europe decreased by €47.7 million, or 4.4%, from €1,075.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €1,027.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting net
contract losses in Europe in 2018 which detrimentally impacted revenues in 2019. At constant currency,
revenue from Western Europe decreased by 4.6%.

Revenue from Eastern Europe decreased by €16.3 million, or 5.6%, from €292.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €276.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency,
revenue from Eastern Europe decreased by 6.0%. The decrease was primarily attributable to the effect
of a contract loss in 2018, most notably in Poland. Poland and Russia together accounted for 80.9% of
revenue from Eastern Europe in 2019, compared to 80.7% in 2018. In Poland, revenues decreased by
12%, reflecting the above-mentioned contract loss in 2018. In Russia, revenues increased by 6%, more
than offsetting the effects of a contract loss.

Revenue from the Americas increased by €47.6 million, or 7.7%, from €620.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €667.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency,
revenue from the Americas increased by 4.5%. The increase was primarily due to strong sales across in
Brazil, Mexico and the United States.


-----

Revenue from the rest of the world increased by €5.5 million, or 1.8%, from €303.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. At constant currency,
revenue from the rest of the world increased by 5.7%.

**Cost of Sales**

Cost of sales decreased by €5.2 million, or 0.3%, from €1,666.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to €1,661.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of sales represented 72.8% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 72.7% for the year ended December 31,
2018, reflecting a gross margin of 27.2% and 27.3%, respectively. The slight decrease in the gross
margin was attributable to lower sales volumes, higher cost of raw materials, inflation, investment in
manufacturing and unfavorable currency movements, largely offset by positive pricing and mix impact
and operational savings. Raw materials prices increased in 2019, which had a negative impact of
approximately 370 basis points on the gross margin. Fluctuations in exchange rates other than the Euro/
U.S. Dollar exchange rate also had a slightly negative impact on the gross margin of approximately 250
bps.

**Distribution Expenses**

Distribution expenses decreased by €5.3 million, or 2.5%, from €208.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €203.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Distribution expenses
represented 8.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 9.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in distribution expenses was due primarily to decreased sales
volumes in 2019 and certain efficiency gains.

**Sales and Marketing Expenses**

Sales and marketing expenses increased by €9.5 million, or 6.0%, from €158.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €168.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales and marketing
expenses represented 7.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 6.9%
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses, both overall and
as a percentage of our revenue, was primarily due to increased marketing investment in e-commerce
activities.

**General Administrative Expenses**

General administrative expenses increased by €7.4 million, or 8.9%, from €83.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily
due to investments in R&D and IT capabilities. General administrative expenses represented 4.0% and
3.6% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**Net Other Operating Income/(Expense)**

Net other operating income/(expense) was income of €1.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2018, compared to an expense of €0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA decreased by €34.9 million, or 16.6%, from €209.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to €174.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019; excluding the impact of IFRS 16, EBITDA
would have decreased by 26.9% for the year. Our EBITDA margin was 7.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2019, compared to 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €11.1 million, or 4.7%, from €234.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €245.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Adjusted
EBITDA for 2019 was due primarily to the initial application of IFRS 16; excluding the impact of IFRS 16,
Adjusted EBITDA would have decreased by 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Income and Expenses Related to Changes in Group Structure**

Expenses related to changes in Group structure increased by €43.3 million, or 279.4%, from an expense
of €15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of €58.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these expenses primarily related to our


-----

reorganization and comprehensive transformation plan, T2G, and related to in-depth assessments of our
operational and commercial processes and the commencement of certain projects intended to increase
operational efficiency. For 2018, these expenses were primarily related to the transfer of our
manufacturing operations in Aparecida de Goiânia in Brazil to our manufacturing site in Senador Canedo.
This move was made after an in-depth analysis and considering the efficiency of consolidating our
production into a single facility, where it will be possible to deploy efficient technologies and processes.

**Income and Expenses Related to Impairments and Major Litigations**

Expenses related to impairments and major litigations increased by €2.7 million, or 30.7%, from
€8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €11.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2019. The main expense in 2019 and 2018 was related to the impairment of assets as a result of the
transfer of our manufacturing operations in Aparecida de Goiânia in Brazil to our manufacturing site in
Senador Canedo.

**Operating Profit**

Operating profit decreased by €65.6 million, or 42.9%, from €152.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €87.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our operating profit margin
was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The
decline in operating profit for 2019 was primarily attributable to the incurrence of certain significant
non-recurring costs, in particular the expenses related to our reorganization and comprehensive
transformation plan, T2G.

**Net Finance Costs**

Net finance costs increased by €9.1 million, or 31.8%, from an expense of €28.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 to an expense of €37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Finance
costs in 2019 were impacted by a higher average interest rate due to an increase in net debt and an
increase in the proportion of local debt (which generally carries a higher interest rate) within total debt, in
order to better match our financing payments with operating cash flows. Finance income was stable in
2019 as compared to 2018, at €2.6 million (as compared to €2.5 million in 2018).

**Income Tax**

Income tax decreased by €15.0 million, or 55.1%, from €27.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2018 to €12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower
profit before tax.

**(Loss) / Profit for the Year**

Profit for the year decreased by €59.7 million, or 61.5%, from €97.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profit for the
year was attributable primarily to non-recurring incurred in connection with our reorganization and
comprehensive transformation plan, T2G.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity are and are expected to continue to be cash flows from operations, future
borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, the Factoring Agreement (as defined below) and potential
future borrowings through the issuance of debt securities. Please see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—New Syndicated Facilities Agreement” and “Description of_ _Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Syndicated Factoring Agreement”. We have also entered into bilateral factoring_
arrangements in respect of our Italian, Mexican, Brazilian and Russian operations.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be adequate to meet our
anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making


-----

payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than
expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek
additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to
arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general
economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets,
restrictions in instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance. Please see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—The substantial_
_leverage and debt service obligations of the Group could adversely affect its business and may prevent_
_it from fulfilling its obligations, including under the Notes and Guarantees”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—Restrictions imposed by the Indenture and_
_certain of the Group’s other outstanding debt agreements will limit its ability to take certain actions,_

_opportunities and activities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes_
_and Guarantees—The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are holding companies that have no or_
_limited revenue-generating operations of their own and will depend on cash from the operating companies_

The following table sets forth our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and
the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

**Three months ended**
**March 31,** **Year ended December 31,**

**Cash and cash equivalents at end of period . . . . . . . . . .** 227.4 138.1 430.1 127.8 130.6

**_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_**

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €3.1 million, from €27.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €24.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Working capital
benefited from proceeds from factoring in the amount of €145.5 million.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €48.5 million, from €239.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €190.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to
lower EBITDA generation resulting from significantly lower sales and lower cash generation from working
capital. Working capital benefited from proceeds from factoring in the amount of €156.0 million.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €69.3 million, from €169.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €239.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly
due to strict working capital management. Working capital benefited from proceeds from factoring in the
amount of €161.4 million.

**_Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities_**

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €3.2 million, from €15.3 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 to €12.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was
due to lower capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021.

Cash flow used in investing activities increased by €10.9 million, from €101.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €112.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly
due to the acquisition of the feminine hygiene business of Albaad in Rockingham County, North Carolina,
consisting of production lines and related equipment as well as a license for all corresponding inventory
and intellectual property.


-----

Cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €16.3 million, from €118.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €101.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to
the payment of contingent consideration in 2018 relating to our acquisition of Grupo Mabe.

**_Cash Flow Used in Financing Activities_**

Cash flow from financing activities was an outflow of €215.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021, compared to an inflow of €8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The outflow for
the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of the repayment of our syndicated
revolving credit facility in the amount of €210.0 million, which had been drawn to provide financial flexibility
in the context of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash flow from financing activities was €242.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared
to cash flow used in financing activities of €141.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The
increase in cash flow from financing activities in 2020 was mainly due to the drawdown of €300.0 million
under our syndicated revolving credit facility to provide financial flexibility in the context of the economic
uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The main cash outflow from financing activities in 2019
was due to dividend distributions, net cash interest expense and debt repayment as a result of strong
cash flow generation from working capital.

Cash flow used in financing activities was €39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared
to cash flow used in financing activities of €141.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2018,
the cash outflow from financing activities resulted mainly from dividend distributions and net cash interest
expense, partially offset by an increase in debt usage.

**Working Capital**

The following table sets forth the components of our working capital as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 and
as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

**As of March 31,** **As of December 31,**

**2021** **2020** **2020** **2019** **2018**

**_(€ millions)_**

Inventories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 325.1 299.8 319.1 318.8 365.9

Trade and other payables and accrued expenses . . . . . . (504.4) (475.7) (517.8) (504.6) (532.8)

Working capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 151.0 176.3 144.6 187.5 257.6

Working capital as of December 31, 2020 was €144.6 million, compared to €187.5 million as of
December 31, 2019. The decrease in trade and other receivables and pre-paid expenses to €343.3 million
as of December 31, 2020 from €373.3 million as of December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower sales.

Working capital as of December 31, 2019 was €187.5 million, compared to €257.6 million as of
December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to in part to a decrease in inventories, from €365.9 million as
of December 31, 2018 to €318.8 million as of December 31, 2019, which was in turn due to a high
inventory balance at the end of 2018, which included a strategic stock build-up. The decrease in working
capital was also attributable to a decrease in trade and other receivables and pre-paid expenses, from
€424.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to €373.3 million as of December 31, 2019, which was primarily
due to an improvement in receivables management (and reduction in DSO).

We believe that our current working capital, together with the amounts to be available under the New
Syndicated Facilities Agreement, are sufficient for our current working capital requirements.

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2021 were €12.2 million, as compared
to €15.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in capital expenditures for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily driven by a strong focus on cash flow and the
prioritization of required capital expenditures.

Our capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and
December 31, 2018 were stable. Our capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2020


-----

were €105.6 million, as compared to €103.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and
€103.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

We estimate that our capital expenditures for 2021 will decline versus prior years, in line with our target to
normalize capital expenditures at a run-rate level of approximately 4% of revenue. See “Summary—
_Financial Outlook and Targets”._

**Outstanding Financial Liabilities**

The table below summarizes our outstanding financial liabilities as of December 31, 2020:

**Less than** **More than**

Agreement, the full amount of which matures within one year, subject to further extensions of the TRS Agreement as
described in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Total Return Swap Agreement”.

This table presents the carrying amount of our total financial debt by contractual maturity of the underlying
cash flows.

**Investment of Surplus Cash**

We primarily use surplus cash for general corporate purposes. Otherwise, we deposit surplus cash in
either money market or deposit accounts held with banks. These deposits are made for fixed terms and
interest is generally payable to us (or, in cases where accounts bear interest at negative rates, payable by
us) at the market rate for deposits or at such other rate as may be commercially agreed with the relevant
deposit bank.

**Group Cash Management**

Our Group-wide cash management is centralized to the extent possible and reasonable. Our operating
subsidiaries keep liquidity only to the extent needed for their daily operations. Any surplus liquidity in our
operating subsidiaries is transferred to Ontex Group NV. Surplus liquidity is used for our general corporate
purposes.

**_Syndicated Factoring Agreement_**

To optimize our cash management, we entered into a Group non-recourse syndicated factoring
agreement (the “Factoring Agreement”) dated February 21, 2018 with BNP Paribas Fortis Factor N.V.
and KBC Commercial Finance N.V. (together, the “Factors”), The Factoring Agreement provides us with
a credit facility of up to €200 million and up to 95% of the amount of the approved outstanding receivables
on all debtors that we transfer to the Factors. The remaining 5% of the relevant receivables is available to
us upon receipt of payment from the relevant debtor. Financing per debtor is capped at 10% of the
aggregate amount of all approved outstanding receivables transferred to the Factors. Any financing
within the credit limit is non-recourse to us. The initial term of the Factoring Agreement expired on
March 20, 2021, upon which the Factoring Agreement was renewed automatically by tacit agreement
between the parties for a new period of one year. At the end of the current one-year term, and each
subsequent one-year term for which the Syndicated Factoring Agreement has been renewed, any party
may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ notice. Please see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Syndicated Factoring Agreement” for further information._


-----

**_Other Factoring Agreements_**

In addition to the Factoring Agreement described above, our subsidiaries in Italy, Russia, Brazil and
Mexico have entered into their own bilateral factoring arrangements. All of these agreements are nonrecourse.

As of December 31, 2020, €143.2 million of financing was outstanding under our factoring arrangements
(compared to €149.1 million in 2019). This is in addition to €12.8 million of financing obtained through the
use of supply chain financing programs offered by our customers. The late payment risk related to our
factoring arrangements has been assessed as immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the non-continuing involvement portion of all nonrecourse trade receivables included in these factoring programs is derecognized.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Other than the Syndicated Factoring Agreement and the other factoring arrangements discussed above,
we believe that we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, operating results, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk**

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the British Pound, Turkish Lira, Polish Zloty, Australian Dollar, Mexican
Peso, Brazilian Real and Russian Rouble in relation to sales, and the U.S. Dollar, Czech Crown, Mexican
Peso and Brazilian Real in relation to procurement. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial
transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. We also have exposure to the Turkish Lira, Algerian
Dinar, Russian Rouble, Czech Crown, Australian Dollar, Pakistani Rupee, Mexican Peso and Brazilian
Real due to our net investments in foreign operations.

To manage our foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and
liabilities, we use forward exchange contracts. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial
transactions, recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s
functional currency. Our treasury is responsible for monitoring the net position in each foreign currency
when possible and appropriate. We apply hedge accounting for hedge related transactions and the impact
of the revaluation is recognized in other comprehensive income.

We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in 2020 maturing at the latest in April 2022 in order
to limit volatility in the business resulting from exposures to sales in British Pound, Polish Zloty and
Australian Dollar, as well as purchases in U.S. Dollar and Czech Crown during 2021. Based on the hedge
strategy, the foreign exchange forward contracts hedge the following forecasted exposures until
December 31, 2021: for British Pound, £60.4 million; for Polish Zloty, PLN 299.7 million; for Australian
Dollar, A$23.9 million; for Czech Crown, CZK 645.7 million; for U.S. dollar (US$66.8 million versus Euro,
US$12.5 million versus Mexican Peso, US$18.7 million versus Brazilian Real and US$13.1 million versus
Czech Crown); for Brazilian Real, BRL 6.4 million; and for Mexican Peso, MXN 3.8 million.

The terms of our foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of highly
probable forecast transactions. We apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts. At
inception of the foreign exchange contracts, these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges. At
the moment the forecasted transactions materialize, the foreign exchange forward contracts become fair
value hedges.

As of March 31, 2021, an unrealized net loss of €1.9 million was recognized in other comprehensive
income, relating to foreign exchange hedging contracts for which hedge accounting is applied. As of
March 31, 2021, the fair value of the derivative financial asset for the foreign exchange contracts
amounted to €2.2 million and the derivative financial liability amounted to €4.6 million.

The following table sets forth the impact on pre-tax profit and equity for the year of a 10% weakening/
strengthening of the Euro against the reported currency with all other variables held constant. The impact

is mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of foreign currency denominated
trade receivables and payables and derivative positions as at the respective balance sheet dates.

hedged positions of trade receivables and trade payables balances.

(2) Impact on income statement of a 10% weakening/strengthening of the Euro against the reported currency on trade
receivables and trade payables balances.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to
cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at
fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk. These risks are managed centrally by our treasury
team taking into account our expectations with respect to the evolution of market rates. We have used
interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage these risks.

_Sensitivity of Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments Related to Loans_

As of December 31, 2020, if EURIBOR interest rates had been 10 basis points higher or lower, with all
other variables held constant, the impact on pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have
been negligible. As of December 31, 2019, if EURIBOR interest rates had been 10 basis points higher or
lower, with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have
been €0.2 million higher and €0.2 million lower, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, if EURIBOR
interest rates had been 10 basis points higher or lower, with all other variables held constant, pre-tax
other comprehensive income for the year would have been €1.1 million higher and €1.0 million lower,
respectively.

_Sensitivity of the Fair Value of Loans_

The notional principal amounts of outstanding fixed payer interest rate swap/cap contracts as of
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was €557.0 million, €557.0 million and €787.4 million, respectively.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

We have exposure to the price of oil because certain of the raw materials used in production are
manufactured from oil derivatives. These include glues, polyethylene, propylene and polypropylene. We
have in the past and from time to time sought to manage our raw materials costs, including those tied to
the price of oil, through hedging.

In relation to our fluff exposure, we have arrangements with certain of our fluff suppliers that reduce our
exposure to volatility in fluff prices. We also decided to hedge a portion of our propylene, polypropylene
and polyethylene exposure that is not covered by such arrangements for 2020.

_Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to commodities_

As of December 31, 2020, if the commodity forward curve had been 10% higher or lower, with all other
variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have been €2.5 million
higher and €2.5 million lower, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, if the commodity forward curve had
been 10% higher or lower, with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for


-----

the year would have been €1.1 million higher and €0.5 million lower, respectively. As of December 31,
2018, if the commodity forward curve had been 10% higher or lower, with all other variables held constant,
pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have been €0.3 million higher and €0.3 million
lower, respectively.

See “—Hedging Committee” below for a description of our hedging policies.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is managed on a group-wide basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,
derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit
exposures to corporate customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. We
assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and
other factors based on which individual risk limits are set in accordance with the limits set by business
managers. Historical default rates have been below 1% in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. Trade
receivables are spread over different countries and counterparties and there is no large concentration
with one or a few counterparties.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets on the
statement of financial position. We have introduced a hedging committee, as described in more detail
below under “—Hedging Committee”.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Our treasury team monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity requirements to ensure we have sufficient
cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn committed
borrowing facilities at all times so that we do not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable)
on our borrowing facilities.

**_Hedging Committee_**

We have a hedging committee in place, currently at the level of Ontex Group NV, which meets quarterly.
The purpose of the committee is to assist the Board of Directors in defining and implementing policies to
utilize financial hedging instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and commodity risks. The Board of
Directors of ONV Topco NV adopted a hedging committee charter, setting up guidelines for the activities
of the committee. The committee (i) will hedge only foreign exchange and commodity risks (collectively,
the “Risks”); (ii) will not engage in speculative trading (i.e., take positions with no underlying Risks);
(iii) will only take positions that hedge exposure for a period of less than one year; (iv) will only trade with
counterparties that have been previously approved by the Board of Directors; (v) will only trade within
pre-defined “trading windows;” and (vi) will only execute hedges that qualify for hedge accounting
treatment. The committee shall submit a hedging “strategy” to the Board of Directors for approval which
quantifies the overall Risk exposure, specifies the Risks that it intends to hedge, indicates the instruments
it intends to use and the specific counterparties it intends to trade with and the trading windows. The
committee shall report its actions and recommendations to the Board of Directors after each committee
meeting.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial
markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and judgments could cause
actual results to differ.

Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial
statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum. We believe the following policies to be the most significant policies that require
management to consider matters that are inherently uncertain or to make subjective and complex
judgments.

**_COVID-19_**

Infectious diseases of epidemic and pandemic potential are considered a significant risk to economic
activity and consequently one faced by us. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been
visible since early 2020 and continues into 2021 is a clear example of such risk.


-----

The COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken to contain the virus and minimize its
consequences (including government lockdowns in most countries), have had and are expected to
continue to have adverse effects on our activities and financial results, including market demand,
operating profitability (EBITDA), financial position and cash flows.

Our entire organization is concentrating its efforts on ensuring safe working conditions and ensuring
supply of essential hygiene products to our customers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health
and safety of all our colleagues is our paramount priority. Since the spread of the COVID-19 virus to
countries where we have operations, we have followed all guidelines provided by relevant authorities.
Where remote working is not possible, we are taking additional steps beyond the guidelines to provide a
safe working environment for employees.

We are committed to serving consumers and customers who rely on an uninterrupted supply of critical,
daily-use personal hygiene products. All our production and supply chain operations are functioning
thanks to our constantly updated business continuity plans, which include working with governments,
customers and suppliers whose support has been critical.

We continue to provide support to the many communities where we live and work through donations of
our products and in-demand safety equipment such as safety gloves from third parties to hospitals,
nursing homes and social support organization.

We complied with all requirements of our loan covenants under our available credit facilities throughout
the reporting period.

As described above, our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results have been and
may continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our solid finance and liquidity
structure should however be more than sufficient to ensure the going concern of the Company.

**_Income taxes_**

We have tax losses and other tax incentives usable to offset future taxable profits, mainly in Belgium,
Brazil, France and Spain, amounting to €557.3 million as of December 31, 2020 (compared to
€583.0 million as of December 31, 2019).

The European Commission challenged Belgium’s EPR system, characterizing this system as illegal state
aid. Ontex, through its Belgian subsidiary Ontex BV, had an EPR covering the years 2011 through 2015.
We have lodged an appeal against this EC decision. The General Court handed down its judgment on
February 14, 2019 in the joint case of Belgium vs Commission and Magnetrol International vs
_Commission. In its decision, the General Court annulled the Commission’s Decision, finding that the_
Commission erroneously considered that the excess profit exemption system constituted an aid scheme.
The European Commission has appealed the decision of the General Court to the European Court of
Justice and we await the outcome.

Furthermore, the European Commission opened individual investigations in September 2019 into each
of the individual EPRs, including that of Ontex, as it believes that each EPR grants illegal state aid, even
if the EPR system does not. The formal investigation into the Ontex EPR continues and it is unclear when
a final decision can be expected. We will have the right to appeal against any decision that concludes the
Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid. Any such appeal will take some time to be heard.

We had fully taken into account the impact of the Commission’s appeal that the EPR system is illegal
state aid being successful, and the Commission concluding that the Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid in
its tax position. Since the outcome of both challenges is not yet final, we will not release the relevant
provisions at this stage.

We have only recognized deferred tax assets on €124.1 million of tax losses and other tax incentives out
of the €557.3 million mentioned above. The measurement of these deferred tax assets depends on a
number of judgmental assumptions regarding the future probable taxable profits of our different
subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. These estimates are made prudently to the extent of our best current
knowledge.

We apply significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. Since we operate
in a complex multinational environment, we assess whether certain uncertain tax provisions should be
recognized in our consolidated financial statements (based on the requirements of IFRIC 23).


-----

**_Impairment_**

We test annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require
the use of estimates. As of December 31, 2020, we used a pre-tax discount rate of 5.7%, 5.3%, 11.2%
and 7.4% for our (i) Europe, (ii) Healthcare, (iii) Middle East, Africa and Asia and (iv) Americas cashgenerating units, respectively.

Future cash flows are estimates that are likely to be revised in future periods as underlying assumptions
change. Key assumptions in supporting the value of goodwill include long-term interest rates and other
market data. Should the assumptions vary adversely in the future, the value in use of goodwill may
reduce below their carrying amounts. Based on current valuations, headroom appears to be sufficient to
absorb a normal variation in the underlying assumptions.

**_Expected useful lives_**

The expected useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets must be estimated.
The determination of the useful lives of the assets is based on management’s judgment and it is reviewed
at least at each financial year-end, pursuant to IAS 16 and IAS 38.

**_Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments_**

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-thecounter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. We use our judgment to select a variety
of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of
each reporting period. All derivative financial instruments are, in accordance with IFRS 7, level 2. This
means valuation methods are used for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair
value are observable in the market, either directly or indirectly.

**_Employee benefits_**

The carrying amount of our employee benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis using certain
assumptions. One particularly sensitive assumption used for determining the net cost of the benefits
granted is the discount rate. Any change to this assumption will affect the carrying amount of those
obligations.

The discount rate depends on the duration of the benefit, i.e. the average duration of the engagements,
weighted with the present value of the costs linked to those engagements. According to IAS 19, the
discount rate should correspond to the rate of high-quality corporate bonds of similar term to the benefits
valued and in the same currency.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

For the accrual for volume discounts (to customers and from suppliers) important judgements are made
on the impact of commercial decisions that will influence the final discount to be received or to be granted.

**Overview & Market Trends**

**_Market Size and Growth_**

The global hygienic disposables market represented an €85 billion market in 2020. Hygienic disposable
products are essential consumer staples that benefit from a relative inelasticity of demand, which
contributes to stable growth even during periods of recession. Over the last five years, the global market
has expanded at a 4.5% CAGR. Given our current business footprint, in particular the relatively limited
exposure to high-growth Asian regions such as China, the market served by Ontex grew at an estimated
rate of 2.8% per year over this period, with many attractive pockets of higher projected growth.

The hygienic disposables market consists of three distinct product segments: baby care, feminine care,
and adult incontinence products, which respectively account for €42 billion, €27 billion, and €16 billion of
overall hygienic disposables market value. Given favorable demographic and adoption trends, these
three markets have grown over the last five years at an estimated CAGR of 4.6%, 3.4%, and 6.1%,
respectively.

From a regional perspective, the size and growth of the hygienic disposable products market in 2020 is
detailed in the table below:

**Market Value in 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

**_Underlying Socio-demographic Trends_**

We believe that demand for hygienic disposable products is influenced notably by demographic growth
and increasing adoption rates. Demand is driven in the baby care market by the number of babies, in the
feminine care market by the size of the female population aged 12-49 years and in the adult incontinence
market by the size of the population over 45 years old. Even though the majority of individuals above
45 years old do not use adult incontinence products, the penetration rate of incontinence solutions in this
segment of the population is increasing, notably thanks to the advent of “light” incontinence products
covering the 45-65 age range. Additionally, the adoption of our products is affected by factors such as


-----

changes in GDP per capita, urbanization trends, awareness of product availability, product innovation,
increasing modern retail trade, and other trends such as the average age of potty training and the number
of people suffering from incontinence.

In Western Europe and the United States, demographics for baby care and feminine care products are
relatively stable and rates of adoption for these products are also relatively high. In Eastern Europe,
demographics for baby care and feminine care products are also relatively stable but an adoption gap
remains in comparison with Western Europe. In emerging markets, we believe that population growth
and increasing adoption rates will contribute to growth in demand for all hygienic disposable products.
Across all geographies, an aging population, resulting in growth in the population over 45 years old, is
expected to contribute to strong demand for adult incontinence products.

The following table sets forth historical population CAGRs for the period from 2015 to 2020:

**Growth in children** **Growth in females** **Growth in persons**
**aged 0 – 2 years** **aged 12 – 49 years** **aged over 45 years**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1.8)% (0.6)% +0.9%

**_Shift in Consumer and Shopper Purchasing Behaviors_**

We believe a certain number of secular trends are driving a shift in behavior from which we expect
ultimately to benefit:

  - Smart choice: consumers around the world are becoming increasingly conscious about their

choices, increasingly favoring retailer brands or local and regional value brands over established
international “premium” brands. This trend has accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic and


-----

related financial crisis, as much of the population has been required to economize on grocery
expenses, resulting in a direct increase in demand for our own-brand and retailer branded
products.

  - Lifestyle brands: consumers are increasingly looking for brands which promote a mission and

value, and they stay loyal to purpose-driven brands. Individualized preferences and tastes drive
demand for customized products and services. Personalized designs and experiences have
evolved from revolutionary to near ubiquitous. In today’s consumption landscape, every consumer
wants to feel unique and seeks out products and services that reflect their identities, and lifestyle
brands are well positioned to benefit from this trend. In the role of trusted partner to these brands,
acting as contract manufacturer, Ontex is also poised to benefit from their growth.

   - Sustainability: consumers are looking for sustainable product choices with an ecological footprint

and are rewarding companies that put these values high on their priority list. For example,
according to an internal analysis conducted using Nielsen data, sales in Europe and the U.S. of
baby care brands and sub-brands classified as sustainable or eco-friendly grew by more than 50%
over a three-year period ending in August 2020.

  - Convenience: for busy consumers, convenience is now a prerequisite, and their definition of it

becomes ever more comprehensive. Consumers seek brands that cater to their specific needs
with new solutions, bundled products, integrated add-ons and innovative business or service
models that provide convenience or an improvement in experience. Strong growth in smart diapers,
baby pants and services for healthcare institutions are key illustrations of this trend, and thanks to
our capabilities we are well positioned to benefit from these shifts.

   - E-commerce: the pandemic has accelerated this trend as a result of health concerns, convenience,

lockdowns and shop closures, and has brought a lot of opportunities for pure-players (e.g.
Amazon), online retailers (e.g. Tesco.com) and the Direct-to-Consumer segment (incl.
subscriptions), which we supply with our products.

  - Homecare: the shift from institutional care to homecare, or “aging in place,” has accelerated,

resulting in growth for adult incontinence sales through retail self-pay channels (rather than sales
to institutional customers).

**Analysis by Product Category and Geography**

The hygienic disposables industry includes five types of players: (i) global brands, (ii) local and regional
brands, (iii) retailer brands, (iv) growing and increasingly important lifestyle/insurgent brands, and
(v) healthcare-specialist distributors. Among these players, Ontex is an international company active in
the growing market segments (ii) to (v). Over the last decade, we have fundamentally transformed Ontex
from a mostly European-focused retailer brand manufacturer into a leading international personal hygiene
company, focused on local consumer and customer needs, across both retailer branded products and
own brand products. As a result, we have now a higher portfolio balance towards the US and developing
markets (vs. Europe) and to the branded business (vs. retailer brands), while maintaining a stable
category mix.

In developed markets, retailer brand products have expanded in recent years as (i) consumers shop
more often at larger retailers, which are much more likely to offer their own branded products in
comparison to smaller retailers, and (ii) consumers’ perceptions of a quality gap between branded and
retailer-branded products have significantly diminished. The table below shows private label market share
as of 2020 in selected developed markets, as well as the change in position over the period from 2015 to
2020:

**Private Label**
**Market Share (2020)** **2015 – 2020 Change**

-----

Recently, economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a general
trend of growth in retailer brands, in particular in Europe, where according to Nielsen the share of
consumers claiming to be budget-constrained rose to 63%, up from only 17% prior to the pandemic. As
a result of COVID-19’s impact on their finances, European consumers have expressed a desire to
economize, with 77% shopping more frequently at discount retailers or value stores, and 89% switching
to more affordable alternative products such as retailer brands. Another trend, more specific the US, is
that the recent COVID-19 related stimulus packages have provided consumers with unexpected liquidity,
which has strengthened the willingness of consumers to try more expensive, purpose-driven lifestyle
brands, thereby accelerating premiumization of the market.

In emerging markets, although retailer brands are expanding, their share remains relatively low, and even
nonexistent in some countries, while a variety of branded players have established leading competitive
positions (such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unicharm). In Turkey, for example, market
share of retailer brands was approximately 16% in 2020, representing growth from 2015 to 2020 of 228
basis points. In Mexico, by contrast, retailer brand market share was a mere 5% in 2020, a decline of 10
bps since 2015. Our strategy in these regions has been primarily based on providing our customers with
our own brands, which are positioned as competitive but affordable alternatives to these A-brands.
Nevertheless, we believe we are also in a prime position to profit from the increasing share of retailer
brands going forward thanks to our global expertise in the segment.

Today, Ontex has a unique position in the competitive landscape of our core markets. In Europe, we have
a leading position in the retailer brand segment (with a large market share lead over the second-largest
player) and strong healthcare brands. Globally, and particularly in the US, we are a key partner for fastgrowing lifestyle brands. In emerging markets such as Mexico, Brazil and the Middle East and Africa, we
operate our own brands with a leading position in selected geographies and market categories. We are
recognized as the worldwide leading alternative to global brands.

**_Baby Care Market_**

The principal products within the baby care category are baby diapers and pants. For further discussion
of these products and their distinct characteristics and features see “Business—Products—Baby Care
_products”. Globally, the majority of baby care sales is still of diapers, however for several years we have_
seen a significant shift from baby diapers to baby pants, with some countries already selling more pants
than diapers. While birth rates over the next ten years are predicted to remain stable, this does not
translate into a stagnant market for baby care products. For example, sales of baby diapers in the U.S.
and Europe grew by three percentage points over the period from 2015 to 2020. Developing economies
also offer rich potential: North American daily consumption of diapers per capita is five times higher than
that of emerging countries. Growth is set to be stimulated by a change in product mix, as consumers
move to more convenient products. Most of the value growth in the category in recent years has resulted
from the increase in sales of higher-margin products such as baby pants.

The global baby care market represents a €42 billion market, with a compound annual growth rate of
4.6% over the past five years. The following table shows the detailed data for key geographies in the baby
care market:

**Market Value in 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €6.8bn +0.2%

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€41.7bn** **+4.6%**

In Europe, the baby care market leader is Procter & Gamble, which holds a 43% market share overall (i.e.
including both branded and retailer brand businesses), followed by Essity, Kimberly-Clark and Ontex,


-----

which hold shares of 11%, 10% and 9%, respectively. In the United States, Ontex holds a 1% market
share in the overall baby care market. In Mexico, Ontex has consistently grown its market share in
recent years, to its current 26% of the overall baby care market. In Brazil, Ontex holds a 10% market
share.

Retailer branded baby care products accounted for approximately 8% of the global baby care market
based on value in 2020, and 24% of the European market, according to Euromonitor. For reference, the
shares of retailer brands based on Nielsen data (which measures the brick-and-mortar retail market only,
and does not account for online sales) are higher, representing 28% and 48% of the global and European
markets, respectively. According to Euromonitor, the share of retailer brands reached 50% in Poland,
43% in Belgium, 35% in Austria, 33% in Germany, 30% in the United Kingdom and 25% in France. In the
US, the share of retailer brands is at 17%. In emerging markets, the share of retailer brands remains low;
in Mexico and Brazil, for instance, retailer brands comprise 6% and 1% of the market, respectively. In
these markets our focus remains on offering our affordable local and regional brands.

With regard to the retailer brand segment specifically, Ontex is the European market leader with more
than twice the market share of its nearest competitor. In the United States, Ontex has been consistently
increasing its share of the retailer brand segment, and is a leading provider of the fast-growing lifestyle
brands in baby care. In Mexico, Ontex is the clear market leader among retailer brand manufacturers.

**_Feminine Care Market_**

Feminine care products include external products, such as pads, which are used outside the body, and
internal products, such as tampons, which are for internal body use. The principal products in this market
are pads, panty liners and tampons. For further discussion of these products and their distinct
characteristics and features see “Business—Products—Feminine Care products”.

Innovations in the feminine care market in the last few years have included the introduction of more
natural materials like cotton, new ultra-thin and flexible products that adapt better to the body, improved
night protection, odor control and more sophisticated prints. The number of women in the target
population is expected to grow and, together with economic development, points to a further growth
opportunity. Monthly consumption of feminine care products per capita in Europe, for example, is 2.5
times higher than in developing markets. There is also an opportunity in the shift in demand towards
products with natural or more sustainable components.

The global feminine care market represents a €27 billion market, with a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 3.4% from 2015 to 2020. The following table shows the detailed data for key geographies:

**Market Value in 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €4.7bn +0.6%

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€27.3bn** **+3.4%**

In Europe, the leader in feminine care products is Procter & Gamble, with a 44% market share overall (i.e.
including both branded and retailer brand businesses). We also believe that the largest producers include
Johnson & Johnson (principally in tampons) and Essity with market shares of approximately 16% and
10%, respectively, while Ontex is the fourth-largest player with a 6% market share. In the United States,
we hold a 1% share of the overall feminine care market.

Retailer brand feminine care products accounted for approximately 5% of the global feminine care market
based on value in 2020, and 16% of the European market, according to Euromonitor. The shares of
retailer brands based on Nielsen data (which measures the brick-and-mortar retail market only, and does
not account for online sales) are higher, representing 29% for the global market and 32% for the European


-----

market. According to Euromonitor, the share of retailer brands within the overall market reached 31% in
Germany, 28% in Switzerland, 27% in Belgium and 26% in each of Ireland and Portugal. In the United
States, retailer brands represent 21% of the overall market. In emerging markets, feminine care retailer
brands still hold a relatively low share; in these markets our focus remains on offering our affordable local
and regional brands.

In the retailer brand segment, Ontex is the European leader, with approximately 3.5 times the market
share of our nearest competitor, according to management estimates. We are also a growing player in
retailer brands in the United States.

**_Adult Incontinence Market_**

Adult incontinence products are targeted at adults aged 45 to 65 people with light to medium incontinence,
as well as adults with heavy incontinence, generally over age 65. For further discussion of these products
and their distinct characteristics and features see “Business—Products—Adult Incontinence products”.

The adult incontinence segment has two main growth opportunities: the increase in the aging
population—by 2030, there are expected to be 2.6 billion people over 45 years old globally—and the
development of emerging economies which is expected to drive adoption rates in these markets. As an
illustration of the potential, the monthly consumption of adult incontinence products in the US is ten times
higher than in developing countries. There is also a trend towards pants and light incontinence products
for adults where the margins are higher than the rest of the category. In addition, care institutions are
increasingly looking for integrated solutions to manage incontinence, not only products but associated
services as well.

The global adult incontinence market represents a €16 billion market, with a compound annual growth
rate of 6.1% from 2015 to 2020. The following table shows detailed data for key geographies:

**Market Value in 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €4.9bn +2.7%

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€16.0bn** **+6.1%**

Growth in adult incontinence is expected to be significant in developed markets as well as emerging
economies. Nevertheless, emerging markets offer the greatest upside as the aging population combines
with increasing adoption. For instance, the adult incontinence market in Turkey has in recent years seen
double-digit growth across all segments. Ontex is capturing that growth and strengthening its position as
the market leader. In Turkey, we are also seeking to strengthen our leadership in the high-growth light
incontinence segment by increasing category penetration and through awareness campaigns. More
generally, across emerging markets and notably in Mexico and Brazil, we are focused on raising
awareness of incontinence and fighting the stigma surrounding the use of adult incontinence products in
an effort to further drive category growth.

In the retailer brand segment, we are the European leader, with a market share approximately 2.8 times
that of our nearest competitor, according to management estimates. In the Middle East and Africa, we
hold several leadership positions in selected markets. And in Mexico, we have consistently expanded our
market share and are currently the number one player in the country by volume. We are also market
leaders in Turkey and hold a 24% market share in Brazil.

There are two distinct markets for adult incontinence products, characterized by distribution channel:
(i) the retail market, comprising sales to supermarkets, grocery stores and other retailers; and (ii) the
healthcare market, comprising sales to healthcare institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes as
well as homecare (which includes sales by specialized shops, including pharmacies) and home delivery


-----

services. While developed markets are generally well balanced between these two channels, sales in
emerging economies are primarily through the retail market.

_a. Retail Market_

The retail market for adult incontinence products accounts for €9 billion, and is the fastest growing subsegment within adult incontinence, growing at a CAGR of 7.9% over the period from 2015 to 2020. This
strong growth has been driven by factors such as (i) economic development, which has allowed more
consumers to afford adult incontinence products, especially in emerging markets; (ii) the shift to homecare
from institutional care; (iii) a growing acceptance of adult incontinence products in the retail sector
generally (with an increasing adoption of pants, notably in the US); and (iv) favorable demographic trends.
The following table shows detailed data for key geographies:

**Market Value on 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €2.1bn +5.9%

Looking forward, we believe that the following factors will contribute to future growth in demand for retail
adult incontinence products:

  - Changes in reimbursement schemes: as customers’ ability to obtain reimbursement upon
purchasing these products (through social security or other healthcare institutions) is becoming
more restricted, the self-pay segment is increasing. In Europe, sales of adult incontinence products
through retail and self-pay channels grew at a rate nine times faster than sales through institutional
or reimbursed channels over the period from 2015 to 2020. Consumers who previously received
these products for free or subsidized through public healthcare institutions are now increasingly
purchasing their products directly from retailers, which in turn provides an opportunity for growth
in retailer brands and in our Healthcare brand products sold through specialty retailers;

  - Growth of home care: an ongoing shift from institutional care to at-home care, which has been
further accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis, will favor retail sales of adult incontinence products;

   - Institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes limiting expenditure: this is expected to result in
consumers increasingly buying adult incontinence products from retailers and pharmacies; and

  - Consumers’ increasing acceptance of adult incontinence products: we believe that retailers are
aware of growing demand for these products and have increasingly been stocking them.
Consumers experiencing adult incontinence, who see these products becoming more widely
available through retailers, in turn feel more comfortable purchasing these products through this
channel.

In Europe, the leader in the retail market for adult incontinence products is Essity, with a market share of
50% overall (i.e. including both branded and retailer brand businesses). Procter & Gamble is the secondlargest, followed by Ontex and TZMO, with market shares of 9%, 8% and 6%, respectively.

Globally, the share of retailer brands as a proportion of the overall adult incontinence market is 11%. In
Europe, retailer brands have gained significant share over the past several years, now reaching a share
of 18%. The shares of retailer brands based on Nielsen data (which measures the brick-and-mortar
retail market only, and does not account for online sales) are higher, at 31% globally and 39% in Europe.
According to Euromonitor, the share of retailer brands is as high as 54% in Portugal, 29% in France and
Switzerland, 26% in Ireland and 25% in Italy. The aforementioned shift from healthcare institutions to
home care and associated growth in self-pay channels is set to bring new opportunities for retailers as
the market expands, and thus to retailer brands.


-----

In the retailer brand segment, Ontex is the European leader, with approximately 2.8 times the market
share of our nearest competitor, according to management estimates. In Mexico, Ontex is the clear
market leader among retailer brand manufacturers.

_b. Healthcare Market_

The healthcare market for adult incontinence products comprises: (i) institutions such as hospitals and
nursing homes; (ii) homecare and home delivery services; and (iii) pharmacies. The healthcare market is
relatively fragmented, with suppliers selling directly or through distribution channels based on the relevant
country’s healthcare framework and reimbursement system. Suppliers may have contact with or
otherwise make sales through governmental departments, local authorities, health insurers, distributors,
hospitals, pharmacies and in some cases consumers in their own homes.

The method of payment or reimbursement for the healthcare market for adult incontinence products
varies by country. However, it is typically a governmental body or health insurer who ultimately pays for
the products. For example, in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (a governmental body)
pays for all products used by consumers, while in Spain authorized pharmacists pay for products and are
then reimbursed by the government. In Germany, the role of health insurers is more prominent as no
reimbursement is provided by the government. In Italy, regional authorities purchase adult incontinence
products with funds provided by the national government. In the United States, around 85% of home
products (corresponding to 60% of the total adult incontinence market) are reimbursed through statefunded health insurance, and delivered by dealers ordering products either directly from manufacturers
or through distributors. In recent years, low-price vertically-integrated distributors have been gaining
market share at the expense of premium manufacturers.

Healthcare accounts for €7 billion of the total adult incontinence market. Although lower than in retail,
growth in the healthcare market remains significant (growing at a CAGR of 4.0% from 2015 to 2020). The
following table shows the detailed data for key geographies:

**Market Value in 2020** **2015 – 2020 CAGR**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €2.8bn +0.6%

The further analysis of the healthcare market which follows only includes core Western Europe markets
(Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) and is based on management
estimates, which are in turn based on Euromonitor, IQVIA data and “healthcare division data mapping”.
Approximately 33% of the market by value in 2020 was comprised of home delivery, 31% by hospitals
and nursing homes, 30% by homecare and pharmacies and 6% by distributors. Our market share varies
considerably by country, with estimated market shares ranging from approximately 5% to 35% in core
Western Europe markets. Across these markets, we believe we are the second-largest provider of adult
incontinence products based on management estimates.

In Europe, we have a leading competitive position both in healthcare institutions and in the home delivery
segments. In the US, we remain a relatively small player, with significant opportunities for growth in this
sizeable and growing market.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading international provider of personal hygiene solutions, with a focus and expertise in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care products. Our products are distributed in more than 110
countries, both through leading retailer brands and through our own brands such as bbTips, BioBaby,
Pompom, Bigfral, Canbebe, Canped, ID, Cremer, Affective, Chicolastic and Serenity. Headquartered in
Belgium, we manufacture and supply retailer brands, partner brands and our own Ontex brands in Baby
Care, Adult Incontinence and Feminine Care to consumers and customers in Europe, the Americas, the
Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia, and as of March 31, 2021 employed approximately 9,600 people
globally.

We primarily sell products to large retailers to be sold under their brands (“retailer brands”) and a range
of own-brand products under our proprietary labels (“Ontex brands”), with the mix between retailer
brand and Ontex brand sales varying by product category and geography. In Europe, we primarily sell our
products to retailers, manufacturing products to be sold under established retailer brands and helping
them to establish or enhance their own brands. We believe that we are the largest supplier of retailer
brand personal hygiene products in Europe by sales, with a market share we estimate to be around
double that of the second-largest supplier of retailer brands in the same region. We also sell Ontex brand
products to institutional and other customers (such as drugstores and specialty medical retailers), in
particular through our Healthcare division. Outside of Europe, our sales mix varies by geography and the
maturity of a given market. For instance, in North America we sell retailer brand products, and have also
begun to capitalize on shifts in consumer preference by partnering with third-party brands which are
mostly active in the lifestyle market (“third-party brands”); in selected other markets across the Americas,
the Middle East, Africa and Asia, we primarily sell Ontex brand products. We also sell a small amount of
finished products to other manufacturers, which is referred to as contract manufacturing. For the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, 52% and 54%
of our revenue was generated from retailer brands (including third-party brands and our contract
manufacturing activities), with the remaining 48% and 46% being generated from Ontex brands.

Our commercial activities are organized across three divisions, namely (i) Europe, (ii) Americas, Middle
East, Africa and Asia, and (iii) Healthcare:

  - Our Europe division is predominantly focused on the production and sale of retailer brands in
Western, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. Our contract
manufacturing activities also fall within this division. The Europe division accounted for 40.0% of
our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 41.8% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020;

  - Our Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia (or “AMEAA”) division is predominantly focused on
the production, marketing and sales of our own local or regional brands, with the notable exception
of North America, where we primarily sell retailer brands and third-party brands. We conduct our
sales and marketing activities through dedicated teams in North America, Mexico and Central
America, South America, and the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The AMEEA division accounted for
37.3% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 37.1% of our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Our Healthcare division is focused on institutional customers (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes and
homecare channels) to which we sell Ontex expert brands and distributor brands. Marketing is
organized at the divisional level, with dedicated support at the area level. Sales activities in
Healthcare are split into three geographical areas: (i) Australia and New Zealand, (ii) France,
Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, Germany, the United Kingdom & Ireland and
distributors and (iii) Italy and Iberia. The Healthcare division accounted for 22.7% of our revenue
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 21.1% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

In addition, our operations activities (including our procurement, manufacturing, supply chain,
engineering, quality assurance and EH&S functions) are consolidated into our Group Supply function.
This centralized set-up ensures that we drive scale and productivity across our global operations, thanks
to our end-to-end ownership of the product lifecycle: the creation of the right products, at the right cost,
with the right materials and the right technologies, with a constant focus on product quality and safety.


-----

Our core product categories include:

  - Baby Care, which includes baby diapers, baby pants and wet wipes. Baby Care products
accounted for 53% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 56% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Adult Incontinence, which comprises light, medium and heavy incontinence solutions for sale to
both retail and specialized (e.g. healthcare institutions and pharmacies) channels. Our Adult
Incontinence products include adult diapers, adult pants, pads and underpads. We also offer
continence care services to support healthcare institutions (e.g. Odobin). Adult Incontinence
products accounted for 35% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 33%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020; and

   - Feminine Care, which includes a range of products such as ultra-towels, fluff towels, panty liners
and tampons, sold through both retailer brands and our own Ontex brands. Through a broad range
of Feminine Care products, we are able to respond to the different needs and lifestyles of women.
All have innovative features that offer protection and comfort at all times and in a variety of
circumstances. Feminine Care products accounted for 10% of our revenue for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 and 10.2% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020;

  - Other products, which comprise complementary personal hygiene products, including face masks,
gloves, body washes and skin care products. These are mostly traded products, purchased by us
from third parties and sold commercially. Other products accounted for 2% of our revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 1.6% of our revenue for the year ended December 31,
2020.

We are headquartered in Erembodegem (Aalst), Belgium and have a well-balanced manufacturing and
sales footprint. We have 19 production facilities located across Europe (including two in Belgium, one in
the Czech Republic, one in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Poland, and one in Spain), Turkey,
Algeria, Russia, Australia, Pakistan, Ethiopia, two in Mexico, Brazil and the U.S. In the U.S., we are in the
process of expanding our operations with the construction of a new production facility in North-Carolina
where we also intend to commence baby diaper production in early 2022. We have 28 sales and
marketing sites globally, through which we make sales in more than 110 countries worldwide. The wide
reach of our production facilities and sales offices enables us to operate across a broad range of markets
in a cost-effective manner. We believe they also allow us to be the only hygiene manufacturing company
capable of effectively serving a range of increasingly international customers. We employed
approximately 9,600 full time equivalent employees as of March 31, 2021.

We enjoy deep and longstanding relationships with our top customers, which are primarily retailers and
third-party brand owners. In certain markets, our relationships with top customers date to our entry into
that market, and are often decades in duration. We also benefit from a diversified customer base, with our
largest customer accounting for 5.9% of our revenue and our ten largest customers accounting for 33.0%
of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

By geographic market, for the year ended December 31, 2020, 47% of our revenue was attributable to
Western Europe, 12% to Eastern Europe, 28% to the Americas and 13% to the rest of the world.

During the period from 2015 through 2020, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.3%
(including the impact of acquisitions), with average organic revenue growth (i.e. growth at reported
currency, excluding the impact of acquisitions) of approximately 0.7% per year.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our revenue was €480 million, our EBITDA was €42 million
and our Adjusted EBITDA was €50 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue was
€2,087 million, our EBITDA was €198 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was €236 million.

**History**

Ontex was founded in 1979 by Paul Van Malderen and initially produced underpads (mattress protectors)
for the Belgian institutional market. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Company expanded its product
range into our current core product categories and grew the business internationally, both organically
and through acquisitions.

After opening a production facility in the Czech Republic and acquiring businesses in Belgium, Germany
and Spain, Ontex was listed on Euronext Brussels in 1998. Following the listing, we experienced rapid
growth over several years, primarily through bolt-on acquisitions in France, Germany and Turkey.


-----

Ontex was acquired by funds advised by Candover in 2003 and subsequently de-listed from Euronext
Brussels. We acquired the diaper production unit of Paul Hartmann in Germany in 2004, and opened a
production facility in China in 2006. In 2008, we opened a production facility in Algeria. In 2010, we
acquired ID Medica, which sells incontinence products in Germany.

In 2010, Ontex was acquired by funds managed by GSCP and TPG. In 2011, we opened two additional
production facilities, one in Australia and one in Russia, and acquired Lille Healthcare, a company
operating in the adult incontinence market in France, in October 2011. In 2013, we acquired Serenity, a
company operating in the adult incontinence market in Italy, and opened a production facility in Pakistan.
In 2014, we completed our initial public offering, and our shares are listed on the Euronext Brussels,
trading under the ticker “ONTEX”.

In 2016, we acquired Grupo Mabe, a leading Mexican manufacturer of disposable personal hygiene
products.

In 2017, we acquired the personal hygiene business of Hypermarcas in Brazil (renamed to “Ontex Brazil”).
In 2017, we also opened a production plant in Ethiopia for the manufacture of baby diapers specifically
designed to meet the needs of African families.

In February 2019, we opened a production plant in Radomsko, Poland to support our Central European
business.

In July 2020, we acquired a production facility for feminine hygiene assets from Albaad Massuot Yitzhak
Ltd. in Rockingham County, North Carolina, United States, to further develop our North American
business.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Focus on attractive product categories with strong market dynamics_**

We are a leading international producer of hygienic disposable products, with a broad global footprint
and a focus on innovation that we believe will allow us to capitalize on structural growth trends across our
product categories and geographic markets. In 2020, the global hygienic disposables market was an
€85 billion market, split into 3 main categories: baby care products (representing €42 billion), feminine
care products (representing €27 billion), and adult incontinence products (representing €16 billion).
Between 2015 and 2020, the global hygienic disposables market has grown at a compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%, driven primarily by strong growth in adult incontinence (6.1% CAGR),
followed by baby care (4.6% CAGR) and feminine care (3.4% CAGR). Growth in each of these markets
is driven by favourable underlying secular trends across all geographies, including ageing populations,
demographic growth (for instance, projected increases in the number of babies aged 0 to 2 years, the
target market for our Baby Care products) and economic development in our markets. We estimate that
our exposure to this overall market growth over 2015-2020 is slightly lower, a CAGR of approximately
2.8%, given our geographical business mix, in particular our lower share of sales generated by fastgrowing Asian markets.

Apart from robust growth prospects, our products benefit from a relative seasonal inelasticity of demand
as non-discretionary consumer staples. Demand for our products is generally not subject to seasonality,
and has historically demonstrated stable growth even during periods of adverse economic conditions. In
fact, in economic downturns, consumer demand tends to shift to more affordable retailer brand
alternatives, in which we are a leading player. Once consumers trial retailer brands, they tend not to revert
back to more expensive A-brand products. Additionally, our products are strategically important to our
retailer customers; these products are key drivers of traffic in their stores and attract profitable shoppers,
including households with children.

We also believe that we are well positioned to benefit from two significant ongoing shifts in shopper and
consumer behavior and related competitive dynamics. First, consumers are increasingly seeking out
affordable alternatives to “A-brands” (in particular, favoring the retailer and value brands that represent a
significant majority of our product offer and revenue). Our leadership in retailer brands in Europe and our
focus on affordable branded products in emerging markets leave us ideally positioned to meet this shifting
demand.

In addition, several consumer trends are driving the premiumization of our three product categories.
Firstly, consumers are turning increasingly to premium third-party “lifestyle” brands aimed at specific


-----

consumer segments and generally sold online or through subscription services. These brands are often
positioned as sustainable and of high quality (e.g. organic composition, natural features). In the US,
these third-party brands expanded by approximately 280% over the period from 2015 to 2020. We are the
preferred supplier for companies entering this space, particularly in the US, where we maintain strong
relationships with key players in the baby care and feminine care categories. Secondly, a desire for
convenience is driving consumer preferences toward more sophisticated products, as illustrated by the
shift from open diapers to closed baby pants and connected adult diapers, which is expected to positively
impact our sales mix.

Finally, shifts in the preferred channels by which consumers purchase our products are expected to
create further growth opportunities for Ontex. For example, sales of our products through online
e-commerce channels have benefited from strong momentum over the past few years, and COVID-19
has accelerated this trend. In 2020, e-commerce sales of baby care, feminine care and adult incontinence
products represented approximately 17%, or €13 billion, of overall sales of €75 billion (as compared to
10% of €63 billion in 2016, and 13% of €69 billion in 2018), according to Euromonitor. The fact that
retailer brands are currently underrepresented in retailers’ online sales represents an additional growth
opportunity for Ontex. Additionally, a shift in preference from long-term adult care institutions (who have
comprised an important customer base for our Adult Incontinence products) to homecare (i.e. self-pay)
solutions within Adult Incontinence also represents a significant opportunity for Ontex. We have strong
Adult Incontinence category expertise and trusted expert brands which we leverage to accelerate sales
through mass retail as well as through specialized retail channels such as pharmacies and e-commerce.

**_Competitive advantages stemming from the scale of our business_**

We are a leading in supplier for trusted local brands, and benefit from strong market positions in several
different geographies and market segments. In Europe, we are the leading retailer brand company in
baby care, with a market share that according to management estimates is approximately double that of
our nearest competitor, rising to 2.8 and 3.5 times larger, respectively, in Adult Incontinence and Feminine
Care. We are also a close number three by market share in the healthcare segment. Thanks to these
strongholds, we estimate that we are the number 3 player overall in Europe. In emerging markets such as
Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Algeria, and Pakistan, we have leading first or second positions, thanks to the
strength of our trusted local brands. Moreover, we have a become a preferred partner for third-party
brands, particularly in the United States.

Our strong position as an international hygiene player drives our scale and provides us with competitive
advantages in the areas of customer relationships, manufacturing, R&D and procurement. As a result of
our broad geographic reach spanning 110 countries across 5 continents, we have been able to build and
maintain deep relationships with leading retailers and aim to act as a single-source provider for retailers
across the various geographies in which they operate. Thanks to our broad operational footprint (19
factories across Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Australia; four R&D centers of
excellence and three R&D hubs), we are among the few companies capable of serving increasingly
international customers and expanding alongside them into new markets. In addition, our overall scale
has also allowed us to develop strong manufacturing capabilities, which have enabled us to continuously
optimize our cost base, while the breadth of our manufacturing footprint allows us to respond quickly and
effectively to changes in customers’ requirements while minimizing distribution costs. We believe that our
scale also supports significant investments in R&D. Despite offering a wide product portfolio and options
for differentiation to our customers, we are able to leverage our scale across common product platforms
and R&D developments. This in turn allows us to offer products of comparable quality to those of our
branded competitors and to continue to deliver innovations and cost-saving opportunities.

Our scale also enables us to effectively control our costs, for instance in the centralized procurement of
raw materials, including arrangements that allow us to benefit from volume discounts. Finally, centralized
organizational set-ups for selected corporate functions and capabilities (e.g. operations, human resources
and product innovation) allow us to further leverage our scale at efficient cost.

**_High quality products across partner-branded and own-branded labels_**

Hygienic disposables are complex products requiring deep expertise in raw materials and production
technologies. Ontex has mastered these technologies through its long history in the industry, through
continuous investments in our in-house capabilities, and by leveraging the know-how of our supplier
partners. Over the years, we have broadened our R&D footprint to four centers of excellence and three
R&D hubs, each co-located at manufacturing sites to ensure a strong symbiosis with operations and


-----

quality departments. We work closely with and maintain close proximity to our customers, to ensure that
we understand the latest developments in their markets and evolution of their needs. This consumer &
customer proximity as well as our deep category expertise feed our innovation pipeline. Our R&D teams
then develop in-house technologies to deliver these innovations. We have our own in-house engineering
department which designs, constructs and adapts production machines to our standards and
requirements. As a result of our industry-leading R&D capabilities, Ontex has a rich portfolio of
significantly innovative and high-quality products. This portfolio enables us to meet our customers’ and
end-consumers’ demands for high-quality yet affordable products, competitive to those offered by the
leading A-brands and customized further to the demands of our customers.

In independent panel tests, laboratory tests and reviews, many of our products receive quality ratings
that are comparable to and sometimes even exceeding those of equivalent branded products. For
instance, the absorbency level of our newest generation of baby diapers tested in independent
laboratories such as Hy-Tec shows a higher level of absorption in our products as compared to that of
leading branded diapers. Additionally, thanks to our patented Secondry[®] technology, we were the first
retailer brand manufacturer in Europe capable of matching the same “instant dryness” qualities as our
primary branded baby diaper competitor, a feature they have advertised as a point of superiority for
several years, thereby setting us ahead of most of our retailer brand competitors.

Another example of leveraging our scale, know-how and intellectual property to create innovative new
products is our development of absorbent products with a channel inside the absorbing core. This channel
technology has been proven in independent Hy-Tec laboratories to absorb fluids at up to twice the speed
as non-channel products. We rolled out this technology on baby diapers across several of our geographic
markets in Europe, the U.S., Mexico and Turkey. In Brazil, we debuted this technology in the market on
our PomPom brand before the leading A-brand upgraded their product with a similar technology. Moreover,
to maximize the value of this innovation, we applied the underlying technology on other products,
including our Feminine Care ultra-towels. This has resulted in a product that absorbs even faster than
comparable products from our chief competitors. We also plan on applying this technology to some
ranges of our Adult Incontinence products, which we believe will differentiate us from our Adult
Incontinence competitors.

Our ability to supply high-quality products that can compete with those of branded manufacturers is of
paramount importance in retaining and winning new business from retailer brand customers. Our
customers invest in quality-led products for their store brands, believing that a quality own-label offer is a
decisive factor for shoppers in choosing their “go-to” store. As a result, retailers maintain and demand of
us very strict quality requirements, including inspections of our production facilities.

Quality is at the very heart of all of our activities. We take compliance and product safety very seriously
and have implemented a rigorous system of controls, audits and certification to support our high
standards. All of our sites operate by the same Ontex Quality Policy, which is supported by ISO, BRC and
IFS certifications. Our functions, production units and sales offices are all ISO 9001 certified (certification
pending in Karachi, Pakistan). Our plants producing medical devices (mainly incontinence products) and
tampons are ISO13485 certified. Our systems are regularly audited by external certification bodies as
well as customers.

Many of our products also undergo additional external accreditations such as the Dermatest skin safety
label, the Allergy Certified label, the Oekotex certification that tests for harmful substances, or the GOTS
label (compliance with Global Organic Textile Standards). We believe that this demonstrated commitment
to product quality and safety makes us a reliable and trusted partner—for our retail customers and end
consumers—and enables us to build solid and longstanding customer relationships.

**_Deep and longstanding relationships with leading retailers and third-party brands and a_**
**_diversified customer base_**

We enjoy deep relationships with the largest retailers in markets where we operate, such as Europe,
North America, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Turkey. Depending on the market, we sell to retailers our
retailer brands (Europe, North America, Australia) or our portfolio of over 30 own-label Ontex brands
(Mexico, Brazil, Turkey). We leverage these relationships to offer our customers products across all
categories and the various geographies in which they operate, with the aim of becoming a single-source
provider of disposable hygiene products. We currently supply our products through over 200 retailer
brands globally and believe we are the only company able to serve increasingly international customers.


-----

In Europe, we provide retailers with predominantly retailer brands, which is to say that we design,
manufacture and market personal hygiene products sold under retailers’ own brands. We have strong
relationships with international and national retailers in several markets, and our relationships with these
retailers allow us to grow as they expand their businesses (including through market share gains and
distribution expansion). We are also able to generate incremental growth through the introduction of new
products picked up by these retailer customers.

In North America and Mexico, a significant portion of our revenues is also generated by sales of retailer
brand products (with an increasing importance of online channels). In Mexico, we provide them with both
retailer brands and our own Ontex brands. In both the US and Mexico, key customers purchasing our
products for sale under their own-brands include large national and international retail chains.

We also enjoy deep relationships with leading third-party brands—either A-brands or smaller third-party
brands sold primarily via e-commerce—for whom we undertake contract manufacturing. Thanks to our
strong Product & Development capabilities, we are the preferred partner for many of these third-party
brand customers to develop the differentiated offerings that will support their growth and bring innovative
products to their consumers.

Our business nonetheless remains relatively diversified, with our largest customer accounting for 5.9% of
our revenue and our ten largest customers accounting for 33.0% of our consolidated revenue in the year
ended December 31, 2020.

**_Broad manufacturing footprint with well-invested asset base and flexible operating capabilities_**

We have a broad manufacturing footprint, with 19 production facilities located across 17 countries, 4
centers of excellence and 3 R&D hubs, which allows us to meet the needs of our customers with a
multi-national presence in a flexible and agile way. Thanks to this global presence, we believe we are the
only company among retailer brand producers to be able to serve increasingly international customers.
We also believe that we are able to offer customers competitive prices since our manufacturing footprint
allows us to leverage scale and optimize logistics costs.

We continuously consider opportunities to optimize our operations, and have made investments in order
to improve our production efficiency while also positioning us for future growth. For instance, over the last
three years, we have (i) constructed a new factory in Radomsko (Poland) to optimize cost-to-serve for our
European customers, (ii) acquired external Feminine Care assets from Albaad to support our growth in
U.S., (iii) built a production facility in the U.S. to localize baby diaper production, (iv) upgraded diaper
production lines to newer technologies in Brazil, (v) rolled out new baby pants lines in Europe, Mexico,
Pakistan and Brazil and (vi) added several new tampon lines in Germany to support our growth. With
these recent and ongoing initiatives, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our
revenue with limited additional capital expenditure requirements. In coming years, management expects
capital expenditures will remain broadly in line with 2020 levels, at a run-rate level of approximately 4.0%
of revenue excluding special projects.

We also maintain a continuous focus on cost excellence in our end-to-end supply chain. We continuously
invest in improving the efficiency of our factories and warehouses through, among other things, planned
maintenance, machine upgrades, automation systems and racking systems to increase storage capacity.
Additionally, we have advanced in-house manufacturing excellence and engineering capabilities.
Furthermore, as part of our T2G organizational transformation initiative, we have defined and rolled out
manufacturing and warehousing best practices to all Ontex locations, which will remain a strong focus
going forward.

We also constantly seek to optimize the use of our assets across our footprint, either by shifting volumes
and lines across our network or closing factories. From 2018 through 2019 we closed two factories, in
Brazil and China.

The flexibility of our production facilities allows us to deliver customized products to our customers and to
respond to changes in demand for our products by reallocating production across our production facilities.
It also enables us to respond with agility when facing unpredictable disruptions in our supply chain, such
as factory closures driven by the COVID-19 crisis and raw material sourcing issues. We can also upgrade
the technology of our product lines with minimal business disruption because of our ability to temporarily
reallocate production across facilities. This also facilitates the sharing of manufacturing best practices,
which enables us to realize production efficiencies and optimize our cost base across the plant network.
Our deep engineering expertise also allows us to redeploy existing machines to support our expansion


-----

into new geographies while limiting capital expenditure and operating costs. For instance, when we
opened our production facilities in Algeria and Australia, we were able to redeploy machines from other
production facilities.

Last but not least, we are able to manage a high level of complexity, demonstrated by our wide range of
stock keeping units, or SKUs, which involve different sizes, concepts and absorption levels. We offer a
high level of product differentiation while leveraging common product platforms across our customers,
thereby leveraging the scale of our R&D investments. We are also working continuously to improve how
we manage the increased complexity inherent to a growing and dynamic product range.

**_R&D capabilities enabling us to deliver a steady stream of innovations_**

Our ability to deliver product innovations is illustrated by an average of 30 innovations (requiring
technology developments and including product upgrades, new features and range extensions) delivered
for our customers each year since 2017. Many of the product technologies underlying our product
platforms can be adapted across multiple geographies and product segments (such as baby diapers,
Adult Incontinence products, and Feminine Care fluff towels) to meet varying market-specific consumer
preferences at an efficient cost.

Our ability to deliver a steady stream of innovations is underpinned by our continuous investments as
well as the unique organization of our R&D infrastructure and team, encompassing more than 100
employees. Our R&D function is primarily conducted through four centers of excellence across Belgium
and Germany and three R&D hubs located in Italy, Brazil and Mexico. As we are committed to applying
the highest scientific and quality standards, our unique innovation capabilities are strengthened by stateof-the-art laboratories, test stands for core development, dedicated full diaper pilot production lines, and
an in-house engineering department designing and building our proprietary manufacturing equipment.
We believe that the strength of our R&D department is directly attributable to this unique research
infrastructure as well as its close integration with manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, we
continuously seek to enhance our R&D capabilities through extensive collaboration with external
laboratories, and partnerships with leading research institutes and start-ups.

We also believe that the strength of our R&D capabilities and deep innovation pipeline is due in part to
our proximity to our different types of clients, which provides us with valuable insights into what
consumers want and how their needs evolve. We use these customer insights to feed our internal
innovation cascade; for example, working closely with retailers that want their brands to be reliable
alternatives to international A-brands obliges us to follow the latest technological advancements in the
market and master the ability to replicate them swiftly, both for our retailer brand customers and for our
own brands. The channel diaper technology, as an example, was initially developed for a retailer brand
client in Europe before being rolled out globally, including through our brand Canbebe in Turkey. Like our
retailer customers, we also create synergies between our third-party brand business and our retailer
brands and own brands. Third-party brands are trendsetters and, by working closely with them, we remain
on top of the innovation agenda and use this experience to feed innovation to other products. In that
sense, we play a key role in democratizing great innovations and making them available across our
product portfolio. For instance, to develop our offer in terms of sustainability, we have worked with different
third-party brands on organic cotton tampons that are now being launched across our retailer brands.

Our strong track record of delivering innovation over recent years includes: (i) channel technology in
diapers, launched in Europe in 2017 and then rolled out to other geographies, including the Middle East
and Africa in 2019, Brazil in 2019-2020 and the U.S. in 2020; (ii) adult pants “discreet-core” platform (both
lycra and elasticated film types) launched in Europe in 2017, with lycra type products introduced to Brazil
in 2020; (iii) organic tampons launched in 2018; (iv) lycra baby pants with channels, launched in Europe
in 2019 and then introduced to other geographies such as Pakistan and Mexico in 2021; (v) channel
technology in feminine hygiene products, launched in Europe in 2019 and then applied to other
geographies such as the US in 2021; (vi) heavy flow towels launched in Mexico in 2020; and (vii) Feminine
Care towels launched in Pakistan in 2021.

This accelerated pace innovation is set to continue over the coming months. Selected examples of
upcoming innovations include:

  - Baby Care segment: introduction of a new core platform on the European retail market, which is
a new generation of diapers incorporating improved absorption characteristics;


-----

  - Adult Incontinence segment: a new generation of adult pants with channels; Orizon (for
European nursing homes), which are connected diapers able to monitor wetness and the body
posture of patients, sending real-time alerts to caregivers;

  - Feminine Care segment: ultra-absorbent pad with 100% organic cotton top sheet for US
third-party brand;

  - Packaging innovations: sustainable packaging solutions, using alternative and recycled content;

   - Sustainability Initiatives (pilot programs): circular solutions and services addressing the waste
impact of our products, including several pilot initiatives in the field of recycling and composting.

**_Invigorated management team supported by reputable and experienced board of directors_**

We believe that our management team possesses a unique blend of operational expertise developed
through longstanding service with Ontex and newly introduced brand and commercial experience needed
to drive the implementation of our strategic initiatives. Members of our Executive Management Team
possess an average of over five years of experience with Ontex, and 21 years in the retail consumer
goods industry.

The longstanding operational experience of our Executive Management Team is complemented by the
consumer expertise and commercial capabilities of several recently hired new members. Our new chief
executive officer, Esther Berrozpe, was appointed in January 2021 and brings over 25 years of experience
in the consumer goods sector, including in senior roles with blue chip companies in Europe and the US.
We also recently hired our new chief financial officer, Peter Vanneste, whose strategic mindset and
thought leadership, combined with his broad experience and knowledge of global consumer industries,
will be key assets to restore our profitable growth. Additionally, in May 2021 we appointed Vincent Crepy
as our chief supply chain officer, a newly created position intended to closely manage our supply chain
end-to-end, drive a step change in our customer service level and maximize operational efficiencies.
Mr. Crepy’s wealth of international experience in consumer goods, in-depth knowledge of the supply
chain and experience in transformation projects to drive operational excellence and performance
improvement will be a catalyst to transforming our manufacturing and distribution networks and to
strengthening our global procurement function. Finally, in January 2021 we appointed Laurent Nielly as
President of our Europe division. Since joining Ontex in 2017, Mr. Nielly has transformed the Company’s
operations in the face of many challenges and will play a key role moving forward in returning our Europe
segment to profitable growth. The remaining members of our Executive Management Committee—
Armando Amselem (President, AMEAA division; with Ontex since 2016), Astrid De Lathauwer (EVP,
Human Resources; with Ontex since 2014); Annick De Poorter (EVP, R&D and Sustainability; with Ontex
since 2003) and Jonas Deroo (EVP Legal and General Secretary; with Ontex since 2015)—bring decades
of experience and deep expertise in their respective fields that we believe will be crucial to implementing
our strategic transformation. See “Management—The Issuer—Executive Management Team”.

Our dynamic management team is complemented by a strong board of directors possessing a wide
variety of skills and deep expertise in relevant fields and industries. The members of our board possess
an average of 32 years of experience, and a majority have experience and skills in the consumer goods
and retail industries. See “Management—The Issuer—Directors”.

**Our Strategies**

**_Introduction_**

Ontex enjoys a leading position in the personal hygiene market across our three core categories and the
geographies where we operate. Our strategic positioning, extensive industrial footprint and recognized
expertise allow us to benefit from the continued structural growth in demand for our products, driven by
positive socio-demographic and adoption trends and shifts in consumer behavior.

We have a unique business model that is based on three elements: proximity, flexibility and affordability.
We are close to our customers and consumers, and are able to leverage flexibility in operations in order
to deliver winning solutions in an affordable way. This model has been the key driver of our success in the
past, and we believe that it can be reinvigorated through the launch of new strategic initiatives aimed at
restoring growth, improving profitability, stepping up cash generation and building a future-proof business
model. We believe we will achieve these goals by following six strategic pillars:

   - Focusing more sharply on our portfolio, via simplification of businesses and products;


-----

   - Enhancing customer-centricity, with a strengthening of customer relations leading to a return to
growth;

  - Accelerating the cadence of product innovation;

   - Restoring our operational excellence via improvement of cost competitiveness and service levels;

  - Transforming our organization and culture by driving individual accountability and performance,
while reviewing our structure to improve speed to market; and

   - Setting clear long-term environmental and social objectives.

We expect the turnaround of our business to be realized over coming years. We have prepared a strategic
agenda, which is outlined in the following paragraphs, organized around three main themes: (i) a new
culture, (ii) a focused portfolio, and (iii) a reinforced value-creation model.

**_New Culture_**

_Roll Out New Organizational Model and Performance Culture_

Since the beginning of 2021, we have been developing a new organizational model, structured around:
(i) Commercial Divisions, including a new Europe Division (resulting from the merger of our current
Europe and Healthcare divisions) and AMEAA Division (overseeing our operations in North America,
Brazil, Mexico, the Middle East, Africa and Asia); (ii) Operational Functions, including a supply chain and
an R&D division and (iii) Supporting Functions, including our Finance & Technology, HR and Legal
divisions. Our organization has also been renewed with new arrivals, notably and most recently of our
CFO, Peter Vanneste, in May 2021.

We expect these changes to strengthen our performance based on the above-mentioned three elements:

  - Proximity: the development of a de-layered commercial organization will bring us closer to
consumers (with senior sales leaders closer to our customers than previously). In Europe,
proximity will also be reinforced by an omni-channel approach and less duplication of functions. In
addition, our two geographical divisions will be accountable for all channels in a geography—
instead of our previous structure comprising three divisions that mixed geographies and channels,
with no single ownership across channels—which will bring us closer to customers;

   - Flexibility: consolidating the internal ownership of our products and innovation, instead of the
existing delegation of product portfolio ownership locally, is expected to drive scale while still
allowing for flexibility to meet local requirements; and

   - Affordability: implementation of end-to-end productivity targets with single points of
accountability for total delivered cost, service, quality, and safety, in contrast to the current
approach which siloed these functions. We expect this new organizational model to streamline the
organization, resulting in a lower cost structure.

In addition, we aim to create a new winning, performance-driven culture cemented in a new incentivization
and remuneration policy aligned with shareholders’ interests. Our objective is to clearly cascade
ownership and accountability on key goals, which should increase the speed of decision-making. Our
performance management system will be reinforced by several measures (including target setting,
monitoring of performance, feedback, etc.), and a culture emphasizing results over effort. Transparency
in the disclosure of performance targets will be a key element in the success of our project.

**_Focused Portfolio_**

Over the past several months we conducted a comprehensive review of our portfolio in order to maximize
value from our businesses and brands. As a result, we have identified clear priorities: (i) turnaround
Europe retailer brands, (ii) outperform in North America, (iii) grow our brands in selected emerging
markets, (iv) accelerate growth in our Adult Incontinence segment globally and (v) divest certain noncore assets.

_Turnaround Europe Retailer Brands_

Ontex enjoys a strong leadership position in the retailer brands segment in Europe, which is a promising
and growing market, in particular given the expected further increase of the value share of retailer brands


-----

within the overall market and favorable demographic trends, especially in relation to adult incontinence
products. Nevertheless, more recently we have been underperforming in this segment, with our net sales
decreasing between 2017 and 2021 at a like-for-like CAGR of -5%. Our goal is to reverse this trend and
to achieve growth in the European retailer brands segment over the period from 2021 to 2023, by
(i) capturing profitable growth in fast-growing product segments, channels and customers and
(ii) regaining contracts by re-establishing our position as the #1 partner of choice.

In particular, we aim to reposition ourselves in identified areas of expected profitable growth, by
(i) capturing our fair share of baby pants and ecological credentials growth, (ii) outperforming in Adult
Incontinence growth, especially in pants and light incontinence products, (iii) improving our Feminine
Care profitability through innovation and better mix management, and (iv) a step-change in our online
presence, supporting omni-channel strategies and stepping up our presence in Pure Plays.

In order to regain contracts, we intend to restore our position as the preferred partner of European
retailers by rebuilding trustworthy relationships. Our levers to achieve this strategy consist notably of:

  - Customer centricity: performing customer segmentation in order to “win with the winners”, by
bringing sales leadership closer to customers across all functions;

  - Excellence on basics: promoting a level of excellence in services, quality and innovation, with
accelerated innovation cascade and strengthened portfolio management capabilities; and

  - Cost and price competitiveness: optimizing operations and implementing selected pricing
investments based on customer segmentation.

Preliminary measures are already starting to show results, with recent contract gains in 2021 and no
contracts lost since the beginning of the year, resulting in an expected return to net sales growth in the
retailer brands segment later in the year.

_Outperform in North America_

The United States hygiene market is the second-largest personal care market worldwide (representing
€13.2 billion in 2020) with attractive growth rates overall (+2.5% CAGR over 2015 to 2020) and in
particular in the adult incontinence segment (+6.5% CAGR over the same period). Future prospects are
also positive, especially for Ontex, since we intend to leverage on specific trends that will enable us to
outperform the total market, with the aim of continuing to grow our net sales in North America over the
period from 2020 to 2023. These trends and our strategy to capitalize on each one of them consist of:

  - Retailer brands still have significant headroom for growth in North America, given their lower
_relative penetration compared to the European market. We aim to become the go-to partner for_
consumer-driven retailer brands, scaling up our existing strong positions with selected customers.
In addition, we can rely on our already strong position in retailer brands in Europe, where we are
the undisputed number one player, in order to support our strategy in North America;

   - Third-party brands represent the fastest growth niche in the North American market. We intend to
further expand our strongholds in this segment, leveraging on our current position as the number
one partner of third-party “lifestyle” brand owners, thanks to our solid relationships with them in
Baby Care and Feminine Care;

   - Strong healthcare distributors (driven by their own private labels) are gaining market share in the
_fragmented US healthcare segment (in which participants are not the same as in retail). We intend_
to position ourselves as a trusted expert partner for incontinence, building a strong competitive
position in the US adult incontinence market which is still underplayed by Ontex.

We believe we can achieve these objectives in part by leveraging our existing strengths, such as (i) our
category and retailer brand expertise built in Europe, (ii) our commercial relationships with leading retailer
and third-party brands in North America and (iii) our Mexican business, which would allow us to further
leverage scale on procurement, operations and R&D in the region.

Furthermore, we intend to realize targeted investments in order to unlock our growth plans, with focuses
on:

  - Reinforcement of US production: bringing more agility to our operations while focusing on
increasing cost-competitiveness and adding production capacity (including our new North Carolina
factory which is expected to ramp up production in the first half of 2022), including new Baby Care
production lines and the integration of our Feminine Care production assets;


-----

  - Revamp of product and innovation capabilities: improving speed-to-market focused on US
consumer needs, via new product developments and deployment of an innovation “incubator”
model; and

   - Strengthening of commercial capabilities: strengthening commercial teams to increase customer
proximity and intimacy, in particular with third-party brands and retailer brands, enabling us to gain
more granular consumer and shopper insights.

_Grow Our Brands in Selected Emerging Markets_

Today, Ontex holds strong leading positions in selected emerging markets, in both adult incontinence (#1
in Turkey, #2 in Mexico and Brazil) and baby care (#1 in Ethiopia, #2 in Pakistan, Algeria and Mexico). We
can consequently take full advantage of the positive underlying socio-demographic trends, including an
aging population in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and Asia, collectively representing 90% of
global growth in the population over 45, and positive birthrate trends in the Middle East and Africa.
Besides profiting from demographics, we believe we can also benefit from the anticipated increase in
product utilization. Indeed, usage of the products we produce remains significantly lower than in
developed markets (2.5x lower in feminine care, 5x in baby care, 10x in adult incontinence) and our
affordable brands put us in prime position to profit from increasing access to the market and utilization
rates.

Our strategy for these geographies consists of driving profitable growth in existing regions, notably by
growing our brands in selected countries. In order to reach this objective, we intend to take specific
actions including (i) disciplined investments in distribution, pricing, mix and innovation, (ii) support of our
customers in retailer brand development, and (iii) further standardization of our products and brands
across platforms, to benefit from scale advantages.

In addition, we will adopt a more disciplined and focused approach in assessing our exposure to emerging
markets, based on selective criteria and oriented towards value creation. Our key geographies should be
under-served markets, providing us with a right-to-win with strong local trusted brands. They should also
leverage and contribute to global scale, without increasing complexity. Moreover, we will work on mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by maintaining a more balanced exposure between
developed and emerging market currencies. Finally, for further eventual geographical expansion, we will
rely on our scale-up model that starts with leveraging our existing positions as hubs for exports (for
instance, in Puebla, Mexico, and Istanbul, Turkey) and building sizeable business, before considering
establishing local sales forces and launching local operations. Our strategy for further expansion would
therefore be based on a very selective approach, enabling us to keep a lean cost structure through
centralized operations and avoiding significant investments.

_Accelerate Adult Incontinence Globally_

Adult incontinence products represent a fast-growing market (comprising €16 billion globally in 2020, and
demonstrating revenue growth of +6.1% CAGR from 2015 to 2020) in which Ontex is a leading player,
with a strong right-to-win and revenues of €679.5 million in 2020. The company has the number one
position among retailer brands in Europe, a close third position in expert brands in European healthcare
(especially in institutions and home delivery channels), and first or second positions in selected emerging
countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Turkey with our multi-channel approach (retail and pharma). This is
the result of strong competitive advantages expected to continue to drive growth in the future: expertise
and proximity with consumers, a full product range and available capacity, innovative products and
services, cost-competitiveness through operational efficiencies and an omni-channel go-to-market
approach.

However, we have not been able to capture our fair share of the market growth over the past few years.
Accelerating in this category should thus enable us to benefit from the market opportunities and align our
net sales growth with the market growth trends. To that extent, Ontex has implemented a strategic plan
with clear objectives for each geography in which we operate:

  - Europe: protect leadership positions in retailer brands (notably by protecting our fair share,
especially in adult pants and light incontinence, while supporting further market share gains in the
retailer brand segment in general) and scale up in healthcare (notably by strengthening the “expert
brands” positioning and expanding into continence care services);


-----

  - North America: establish a position in the retail channel through partner brands (retailer brands
and third-party brands), and scale-up our position in the healthcare channel by partnering with
selected distributors;

  - Emerging markets: regain and/or protect our number one positions in selected markets (Mexico,
Turkey, Brazil) by accelerating pants and light incontinence product growth while protecting our
strong position in heavy incontinence, and by leveraging leading positions to further expand
regionally following our disciplined profitable expansion model.

_Divest Certain Non-Core Assets_

As part of the broad strategic reevaluation of our portfolio undertaken over the past several months, we
have reviewed our global footprint and are actively considering the best options to create value for the
Group, including exiting from certain geographies, lines of business and sales channels that do not form
a core part of our renewed focus. We may, as a result of this strategic review, divest certain assets or exit
specific regions in favor of markets where we see more favorable trends, more stable economic
conditions, or where we feel we can better leverage our existing business to support our growth model. In
line with our current financial strategy, we would expect to apply the proceeds from material asset sales
to repay a portion of our existing indebtedness.

**_Reinforced Value Creation Model_**

_Deliver Flexibility at Best Cost_

From an operational standpoint, Ontex has clear strengths it can build on, including a global
manufacturing and R&D footprint, significant scale, a wide range of production equipment, operational
excellence and technical know-how. However, these strengths have not been working in full
synchronization, which we have addressed by creating the new supply chain function, with full end-toend responsibility designed to break functional silos.

We have established a clear vision for our operations: deliver flexibility at best cost. To achieve this
objective, we have articulated a roadmap around 4 goals, each one defined by priorities and measured by
key metrics: (i) putting consumer and customer first; (ii) becoming more agile; (iii) turning leaner and
more scalable; (iv) developing a virtuous mindset.

First and foremost, the shift from an “operations first” model to a “consumer and customer first” mindset
is one of our key priorities and translates into the way we work through our quality standards and service
levels, and our operational priorities. These will be driven increasingly by consumer satisfaction metrics,
which we will start to track with closer attention.

Secondly, we believe that agility in delivering innovation comes with simple, flexible, and pragmatic
processes, with mastery of the technology and smart complexity management. We are currently focused
on improving these execution capabilities through measures such as the phasing-out of old product
platforms and rollout specifications and process development.

Thirdly, on a cost and cash management perspective, we plan to shift from an opportunistic model to a
strategic model, breaking functional silos as described above and focusing on net cost savings instead of
gross cost savings only. In addition, we will focus on optimizing capacity and better allocating our capital.

Finally, from a cultural standpoint, we will focus on building a results-based collaboration between our
dedicated teams, enabled by simple and focused organization and processes, alignment of incentives
across functions, and definition of clear accountabilities and expectations. Our goal is ultimately to build
trust and respect among our employees, while increasing their performance thanks to more objective
evaluations based on clear KPIs and less diluted responsibilities.

All of the above will allow us to deliver flexibility at best cost, resulting in expected year-over-year
productivity gains of more than 2% thanks to very specific and concrete initiatives organized around four
areas: (i) procurement (e.g. further leveraging our scale and stepping up our capabilities, tools and
processes), (ii) design to value (e.g. never compromising on quality and harmonizing raw materials),
(iii) manufacturing (e.g. increasing asset utilization and optimizing our maintenance) and (iv) supply chain
(e.g. increasing truck fill-rate and improving our warehouse management).

_Maximize Value Creation Through Innovation_

Innovation is deeply rooted in our DNA, developed by specialists based in our worldwide centers of
excellence and R&D hubs. Over the past 18 years, we have launched 150 new innovations. Indeed, as an
international producer of both retailer and our own Ontex brands, product innovation has proven essential
to our success. We have chosen to constantly invest in our R&D capabilities to further develop our
product portfolio by delivering a steady stream of innovations, and to maintain our leadership position by
creating value jointly with customers.

As a result, our engineers reinvent and design innovative solutions that can easily travel across our global
“technology park”. Our dedicated pilot lines also allow our R&D teams to test new innovations with zero
impact on current operations. As a consequence, we currently have a strong innovation pipeline to
support our growth strategies. Selected products which have been recently launched or will be launched
shortly include:

   - A new generation of diapers, with an ultra-light and ultra-absorbent core, inspired by the Asian
hygiene market;

  - A new generation of disposable adult pants to capture the category’s rapid growth by leveraging
both our expertise in channel core technology and our patented instant dryness system; and

  - Smart premium absorbent slips using integrated sensor technology to monitor the wetness and
body posture, able to provide home care staff with accurate real-time information on mobile or
web app.

In order to reinforce this virtuous cycle of new product and value creation through innovation, and to
leverage R&D synergies for our different businesses, we have simplified our organizational structure,
making it leaner and more sharply focused on fewer projects, in order to enhance agility and speed-tomarket in key areas when it comes to innovation.

_Generate New Value Streams Through Sustainability_

In 2019, we updated our sustainability strategy to ensure that we continue to make a positive difference,
both for our stakeholders and ultimately to the planet. Since then, with the support of different sector
associations, we have been working towards our 2030 goals and evaluating organizations, while stepping
up our social agenda built around diversity, inclusion and the resolute purpose of serving every group of
the population with our affordable and high-quality product offering.

Our sustainability ambitions can be articulated around four pillars: (i) to move towards a circular business
model; (ii) to create a positive impact in our supply chain with the regeneration of natural resources; (iii) to
achieve climate-neutral operations; and (iv) to build trust through enhancing transparency and leading
the way to a fair society.

With regard to the first pillar in particular, we invest significant time and resources on research related to
circular solutions such as reusable products (for example, our hybrid diaper concept), recycling and
composting of the used products. In addition, we are redeveloping the composition of our diapers, using
materials of natural and renewable origin, and launching packaging with significant amounts of recycled
content as well as paper bags.

Innovation across the complete lifecycle of our products—from sourcing sustainable materials to
minimizing the end-of-life impact—is key to achieving our sustainability ambitions.

**_Continued focus on proactive deleveraging_**

In addition to the strategic initiatives described above, we intend to continue pursuing a sound financial
policy aimed at reducing the Group’s overall indebtedness and financial leverage. We believe that certain
of our turnaround policies are already showing results, and that the continued implementation of our
strategic overhaul will support our deleveraging in coming years. As part of this plan we intend to more
proactively manage our cash and our costs, with a focus on optimizing capacity and better allocating our
capital. We also aim to focus our capital expenditures on initiatives that we believe will have the biggest
impact on our business, with the ultimate aim of normalizing our capital expenditures at a lower run-rate
level than in recent years.

Finally, we aim to continue our deleveraging through the proactive reduction of the Group’s indebtedness.
In 2020, as a precautionary measure due to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19


-----

pandemic, we drew down the full €300.0 million available under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to
provide us with financial flexibility. In the first quarter of 2020 we repaid €210.0 million in principal amount
thereunder, and in May of 2021 we paid down a further €60.0 million. In connection with the transactions
we intend to repay the remaining €30.0 million outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility,
and the Transactions are expected to result in a net reduction to our financial indebtedness of
€40.0 million. Additionally, in line with our current financial strategy, we would expect to apply the proceeds
from material asset sales to repay a portion of our existing indebtedness.

**Divisions**

We operate our business through three commercial divisions: (i) Europe, (ii) the Americas, Middle East,
Africa and Asia (or AMEAA) and (iii) Healthcare. These divisions are mainly organized by sales channel
and by the nature of our customer relationships. Our Europe division focuses predominantly on large,
sophisticated chain retailers who wish to build strong retailer brands, to whom we supply retailer brand
products. The AMEAA division is a geographically organized division in which local and regional brands
and traditional sales and distribution channels are predominant. In North America, we sell primarily retailer
brand products and third-party lifestyle branded products, whereas in selected other markets across our
AMEAA division we primarily sell Ontex brand products. Our Healthcare division focuses on sales to
institutional customers, such as hospitals, nursing homes and homecare channels, which are typically
government funded or reimbursed by other third-party payers. While our divisions correlate to some
extent with the geographies in which we operate (i.e., the Europe and Healthcare divisions operate
mainly in Europe), the emphasis is on the sales channel and the nature of the customer, rather than the
geography.

The following table sets forth our revenue by division for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
2020 and the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

(1) Revenues for the Healthcare and AMEAA divisions have been restated for 2019 and 2018 to reflect the effect of a shift in
responsibility for one customer from our AMEAA division to our Healthcare division, effective January 1, 2020. This resulted
in decreases in AMEAA revenues (and corresponding increases in Healthcare revenues) of €9.1 million and €8.1 million for
2019 and 2018, respectively. Overall revenues for 2019 and 2018 are unchanged.

**Europe Division**

Our Europe division is predominantly retailer brand-focused. Using our expertise and innovation
capabilities, we partner with retail customers to design, manufacture and market personal hygiene
products sold under their own brands. Our Europe division also encompasses our contract manufacturing
activities (i.e. production for other manufacturers) as well as some sales of Ontex own brands (e.g.
Moltex, Helen Harper and iD).

Through our Europe division we sell all three of our primary product categories: Baby Care, Adult
Incontinence & Feminine Care products. This division generates the majority of its sales in countries
where demographic trends are relatively stable. For example, adoption rates for Baby Care and Feminine
Care products are already relatively mature, whereas the adoption rate for Adult Incontinence products is
still expanding strongly with ageing populations, supported by wider acceptance and decreased stigma
and trends toward seniors living more active lifestyles and staying at home for longer (rather than
transitioning to institutional care).

The Europe division’s customers primarily comprise large national and international chain retailers, mostly
discount stores, drugstores, supermarkets and hypermarkets. This division has also a small but growing
presence in online sales channels (such as through pure players like Amazon or our retailer partners’
proprietary web shops). This division also encompasses our baby diaper subscription and delivery


-----

business Big Little Change. Through our Europe division we hold strong, leading positions in the retailer
brand segment in each of our three product categories.

Note:

(1) Other products comprise a range of traded products purchased by us and sold commercially, including cosmetics, medical
gloves and other traded products.

**Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia Division**

Our AMEAA division is predominantly focused on the production, marketing and sales of local or regional
brands. In most of our markets across the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, we primarily sell
Ontex brand products, such as Pompom and Bigfral in South America, bbtips and Affective in Mexico and
Canbebe in Africa and the Middle East. The notable exception to this is North America, where we primarily
sell retailer brands and have also begun to capitalize on shifts in consumer preference by partnering with
third-party brands.

The AMEAA division is organized into four geographical areas: North America (encompassing the U.S.
and Canada), Mexico & Central America, South America and the Middle East, Africa & Asia
(encompassing Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, Pakistan and Southeast Asia).

The AMEAA division is active across all three of our primary product categories: Baby Care, Adult
Incontinence & Feminine Care products. This division makes most of its sales in countries where the
potential for growth of hygienic disposable products market is supported by lower, but increasing, adoption
rates for such products as compared to the markets served by our Europe division. In such markets, it
sells both retailer brand products and Ontex branded products, to national and international retailers, and
also sells a portion of its products through distributors and wholesalers. The North American market, by
contrast, is demographically more similar to Europe and characterized by a mature market with high
adoption rates for each of our product categories and a high degree of consumer choice. In North
America we supply primarily retailer brand products as well as partnering with third-party brands. This
division has also a small but growing presence in online sales channels (such as through pure players
like Amazon or our retailer partners’ proprietary web shops).

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, 33% and 32% of
the AMEAA division’s revenue was generated from retailer or third-party brand products, with the
remaining 67% and 68% being generated from Ontex brand products, respectively.

Note:

(1) Other products comprise a range of traded products purchased by us and sold commercially, including cosmetics, medical
gloves and other traded products.

**Healthcare Division**

The Healthcare division primarily sells Adult Incontinence products through distributors or directly to
institutional customers in the healthcare market, such as governmental departments, local authorities,
health insurers, hospitals and nursing homes and in some cases directly to consumers in their homes
(sales of Adult Incontinence products through retail channels are included in the revenue of our other
divisions). This division also sells to the “self-paid” segment, including pharmacies, specialized medical
shops and e-commerce outlets.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of Adult
Incontinence products accounted for 92% and 93% of the Healthcare division’s revenue, respectively.
The Healthcare division also sells small volumes of Baby Care, Feminine Care and certain other products
to institutional customers. The division sells branded and, to a much lesser extent, retailer brand products,
and operates almost exclusively in Western Europe. The Healthcare division’s branded products, such as
iD, Lille and Serenity, are well known in their respective markets and have been established for
many years. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, 85%
and 86% of the Healthcare division’s revenue was generated from Ontex brand products, with the
remaining 15% and 14% being generated from retailer brands, respectively.

Note:

(1) Other products comprise a range of traded products purchased by us and sold commercially, including cosmetics, medical
gloves and other traded products.

**_Baby Care Products_**

Our Baby Care segment consists of three product lines: baby diapers, baby pants and wet wipes, which
are described below. The Baby Care category represented €1,163 million of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020, of which approximately 87% was contributed by baby diapers, 12% by baby
pants and 1% from wet wipes. Our Baby Care products are mostly sold to retailers via our Europe and
AMEAA divisions. In our Europe division, our Baby Care products are mostly sold as retailer brands. In
the AMEAA division, we sell our Baby Care products primarily under Ontex brands, with the exception of
North America where they are mostly sold as retailer brands or to third-party brands.

_Baby Diapers_

Baby diapers are disposable garments consisting of a waterproof layer, an absorbent core (made from
fluff and super-absorbent powder) and mainly non-woven and elasticized materials. Baby diapers have
an open construction (as differentiated from baby pants as described below) and are closed on the front
side using adhesive tape.

We produce a range of basic to premium-quality baby diapers for use by premature babies up to older
infants (typically up to 3 years old). The differentiation of basic versus premium diapers is based on


-----

factors such as the core technology, parameters of absorption, rewet capacity, softness and fit. Our basic
diaper meets basic absorption and fit requirements and has no extra features, whereas our premium
diaper offers better stretch, softness and absorption qualities.

We offer different core technologies (e.g. with or without channels, “thin anatomical” vs. “optimized
straight” cores) and a wide range of product features (e.g. frontal tapes, elastic ears, closure tapes, levels
of softness, tailor-made print designs) to allow customers a variety of choices to best suit their needs.
Certain of our baby diaper offerings also include natural or sustainable components, in keeping with
recent consumer trends towards more ecological products.

_Baby Pants_

Baby Pants have the same basic construction as Baby Diapers, except that they have a closed
construction and therefore resemble classic underwear. The elastic ears and adhesive tapes of a typical
baby diaper are replaced by a sealed elastic belt, and their elastic sides allow baby pants to be pulled up
and down. Our Baby pants have the same absorption and features as our baby diapers.

Our range of baby pants include three main types: regular pants, swim pants and night pants. Regular
pants are intended for babies and toddlers up to 3 years old. They provide parents a more convenient
changing experience when toddlers start to crawl or potty-train. Swim pants have a slightly different
construction (no fluff or super absorber) and are intended to be worn while swimming. Night pants are
intended to be worn while sleeping, and target children up to age 15 facing bedwetting.

_Baby Wipes_

Baby wipes are synthetic cloths used for cleaning or drying and are designed specifically for use on
babies.

**_Feminine Care Products_**

Our Feminine Care products range consists of external products, such as sanitary towels and panty
liners, and internal products such as tampons. The Feminine Care category represented €212 million of
our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our Feminine Care products are mostly sold through our Europe division to retailer brands and in our
North America business unit to both third-party brands and as retailer brands.

_Sanitary Towels_

Sanitary towels are disposable absorbent pads used by women to absorb menstrual flow. They are made
of a back sheet to protect underwear from leakage, an absorbent core comprised of fluff or air-laid sheet
and super-absorbent powder, an acquisition and distribution layer and a top sheet in contact with the skin.
An adhesive strip keeps the fluff towel in position during use. Individual wrapping enables these products
to be discreetly carried and provides an easy method of hygienically wrapping the used product for
disposal.

We produce a range of sanitary towels in different formats and shapes and with a wide variety of features
in order to allow for proper differentiation to our customers. Our sanitary towels range from towels for
discreet daytime use to towels for heavy night use, are offered with and without wings and are
anatomically shaped for women, and certain towels are constructed using sustainable or eco-friendly
materials. Our range of sanitary towels include thin Ultra towels and classic Fluff towels.

_Panty Liners_

Panty liners are thin absorbent pads used to protect underwear in daily usage. Panty liners are layered,
containing a back sheet, absorbent core, a light acquisition and distribution layer, and a soft top sheet.
The essential requirements for panty liners are comfort and protection. We produce wide a range of
panty liners because their consumption pattern, as well as their composition, differ across countries.

_Tampons_

Tampons are absorbent plugs for internal body use by women to absorb menstrual flow. We produce a
wide range of tampons, including both digital tampons (non-applicator tampons) and tampons with


-----

applicators (short plastic, long plastic and cardboard). We also offer both viscose and 100% organic
cotton fiber tampons. Tampons are available in various sizes, which correspond to their absorbency
levels.

**_Adult Incontinence Products_**

Adult Incontinence products are disposable devices specifically designed to manage light, moderate and
heavy incontinence.

The Adult Incontinence category represented €680 million of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Our Adult Incontinence products are sold across all three of our commercial
divisions. In our Europe division, they are mostly sold as retailer brands. In our Healthcare division, they
are mostly sold under Ontex brands (e.g. iD, Lille, Serenity) to specialized healthcare channels (e.g.
hospitals/clinics, pharmacies and home delivery channels). In our AMEAA division, they are mostly sold
under Ontex brands in Mexico (e.g. Affective, Liverty), Turkey (e.g. Canped) and Brazil (e.g. Bigfral,
Moviment).

_Light Incontinence Products_

Light incontinence products are disposable small pads made of an absorbent core (comprised of fluff
and super-absorbent powder), a waterproof plastic layer and soft non-woven fabrics. These feature a
wide adhesive strip to secure the pad in position, and an anatomical shape and elasticized to help achieve
a comfortable fit. Several levels of absorbency are available, offering solutions for different levels of
stress and light incontinence.

_Adult Pants_

Adult pants are disposable adult garments resembling underwear with an absorbent core (fluff and superabsorbent powder), a plastic layer, elastics and soft non-woven fabrics. Adult pants are designed for
users with an active lifestyle and can prolong independence. The pants are typically fully elasticized to
ensure a close fit.

_All-in-one Tape Systems_

All-in-one tape systems are diaper-like products for adults with adhesive tapes operating as a closure
system, an absorbent core and non-woven materials. They are suitable for moderate to heavy
incontinence and are produced in a wide range of sizes and absorbencies. The products with a textile
back sheet feature breathable side panels as well as fully resealable fixing tapes to ensure a secure fit
and anti-leak cuffs to minimize the risk of leakage.

_Belt Diapers_

Belt diapers are disposable diapers for adults featuring a specific closure system with an absorbent core
and non-woven materials. The belt product offers an alternative to all-in-one tape systems and the twopiece shaped pad system. The use of a belt with resealable hook and loop fasteners removes the need
for separate fixation pants, making the pad easier to fit and more comfortable. The product also features
anti-leak cuffs to minimize leakage.

_Shaped Pads_

Shaped pads are larger pads for adults with an absorbent core made of super-absorbent materials. They
are available in several absorbencies and are suitable for moderate to heavy incontinence. Shaped pads
feature a white textile back sheet with double wetness indicator and anti-leak cuffs to minimize the risk of
leakage.

_Underpads_

Underpads are absorbent sheets used to protect beds and seats. They consist of a plastic back sheet, an
absorbent thin fluff-mat and a non-woven cover. They are available in a number of sizes and
absorbencies.

**Customers**

**_Retailers_**

In our Europe and AMEAA divisions, we sell our products primarily to retailers. In Europe, most of our
revenues are generated from “modern trade” retailers that sell their products both in brick and mortar
stores (e.g. hypermarkets and supermarkets) and through online channels. Sales to retailers also
represent a significant share of our revenues in North America and Mexico.

In our Europe division, we supply retailers predominantly with retailer brand products: we design,
manufacture and market personal hygiene products which these retailers sell under their own brands.
We have strong relationships with a number of national and international retailers. These relationships
allow us to grow alongside these retailers as they expand their businesses. We also are able to generate
incremental growth through the introduction of new products.

A significant portion of our revenues in North America and Mexico are also generated from retailer
customers. In North America, we sell primarily under retailer brands, and in Mexico we provide them with
both retailer brand and Ontex brand products. Key North American customers and Mexican customers
include a number of national and international retailer chains.

We enter into framework agreements with the majority of our retailer customers. These agreements are
generally on a non-exclusive basis and generally contain no minimum purchase obligations. These
agreements typically do not have a fixed term, and when they do, the term is generally one to three years.
Some of these agreements are automatically renewable or continue indefinitely if neither party
terminates. In the event a customer wishes to cease purchasing products from us, we are usually provided
with sufficient notice to allow us to run down inventories dedicated to that customer while that customer
works to ramp up production with its new supplier.

**_Third Party Brands—Contract Manufacturing_**

Our activities also include contract manufacturing, in which we manufacture products for third parties that
own the brands and manage their commercialization across wide range of customers and/or channels.
We distinguish between 2 types of contract manufacturing customers.

First, we engage in contract manufacturing of products for large brands that are also produced by the
manufacturer itself. In this case, production is usually outsourced for selected product ranges because
the manufacturer does not have the appropriate equipment and/or enough capacity to produce in
sufficient quantities.

Second, we provide contract manufacturing for smaller brands that are owned and managed by
companies that usually do not have their own production facilities, focusing instead on the
commercialization aspects (e.g. sales and marketing). These third-party brands are usually positioned
as “lifestyle” brands and are sold primarily online. These customers usually have a good understanding of
what their consumers are looking for, and partner with us to develop the right solution for them, leveraging
our expertise, innovation capabilities and a collaborative approach for development of products.

**_Distributors_**

In several of the countries comprising our AMEAA division (in particular certain countries in Central
America, the Middle East and Africa) we primarily sell products to distributors, wholesalers and other
intermediaries who market our products to traditional stores. Our Healthcare division also sells a portion
of its products through distributors.

Contracts with distributors typically have a one-year term, with automatic renewals. Distributors are mainly
appointed on an exclusive basis within our product portfolio. Pursuant to our contracts, distributors are
responsible for delivering products to retailers and must also maintain a certain minimum level of goods
in stock.

**_Institutional_**

Our Healthcare division supplies institutions such as governmental departments, local authorities,
hospitals, health insurers and nursing homes, either directly or through distributors. Typically, agreements
with these customers are based on open tender processes (generally for a term of two to four years) or
contractual supply agreements based on detailed price conditions by product reference.


-----

**_Direct-to-consumer_**

In our Europe division we sell our exclusive brands, Little Big Change (Baby Care) and A Lovely Day
(Adult Incontinence), exclusively online in specialized marketplaces via a direct-to-consumer subscription
model. In our Healthcare division, our Ontex brands, iD and Serenity, are also sold via our proprietary
e-commerce platform and in specialized online marketplaces.

In our AMEAA division, we sell several of our own Ontex brands in different regional online marketplaces.

**Production, Transportation and Delivery**

**_Production Facilities_**

We currently operate 19 production facilities located across Europe (two in Belgium, one in the Czech
Republic, one in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, one in Poland and one in Spain), Turkey, Algeria,
Russia, Australia, Pakistan, Ethiopia, two in Mexico, Brazil and the U.S. The total production capacity of
our production facilities across all products was approximately 26.1 billion products per annum as of
April 30, 2021. Our production facilities are strategically located in our core markets and close to our
major customers, which helps limit transportation costs. Our operations in Eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa also allow us to take advantage of lower production costs. We endeavor not to rely solely
on any single facility for any of our products, and to maintain flexibility to redistribute production among
our facilities as needed in the event of planned maintenance, unforeseen shutdowns or fluctuations in
demand.

In terms of our product range, as of April 30, 2021, 13 of our production facilities produce Baby Care
products using 105 machines; six of our production facilities produce Feminine Care products using 110
machines; and nine of our production facilities produce Adult Incontinence products using 61 machines.

The table below sets forth our production facilities and the products they currently manufacture:

We have well-maintained production facilities with capacity for growth. All of our production facilities are
regularly inspected and are maintained to high standards. In addition, our larger retail customers regularly
audit our production facilities. We believe that our investment in improving and maintaining production
facilities has resulted in a regular improvement in production efficiency across product categories during


-----

the past few years. Since 2018, we have invested in 16 new production lines, mainly in the fast-growing
categories of adult and baby pants, but also in baby diaper lines in our new Polish plant and for
replacement of older technology in our Brazilian plant. In the U.S., we intend to relocate our U.S. Feminine
Care product production to a new plant and to start baby diaper production in the second half of 2021.

The flexibility of our production facilities allows us to deliver customized products to our customers and
respond to changes in demand for our products or to disruptions across our business while minimizing
our costs of production. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced production
disruptions in certain of our factories, but were able to secure supply in all countries by redirecting
production via temporary support flows organized between our plants. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating
_to our industry and our business—We may experience disruptions at our production facilities or, in_
_extreme cases, our production facilities may be shut down”._

**_Transportation and Delivery_**

In general, we arrange for our products to be delivered to our customers directly. In some instances,
however, the customer collects the products from the relevant production facility or warehouse or
distribution center. Where we deliver our products to our customers directly, we transport our products
using a range of third-party transport companies. Where possible, we consolidate shipments of our
products to our customers, which can lead to cost savings. We may also engage a transport company to
transport products from our production facilities to the relevant warehouse or distribution center. To
provide maximum flexibility, we utilize a mixture of leased and owned warehouses which we operate
ourselves and distribution centers which are operated by third parties, whom we pay for each pallet that
passes through the facility. Our transportation and delivery costs vary by sales channel. For example,
such costs can be a larger percentage of sales in the Healthcare division, particularly in the home delivery
and nursing home channels, relative to similar retailer branded products distributed by our Europe
division.

**Raw Materials**

Raw materials and packaging costs accounted for between 70% and 75% of our cost of sales for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Our key raw
materials are fluff, super-absorber and non-woven fabrics. The relative percentage of these materials
varies by product.

We purchase our key raw materials from a broad base of suppliers and endeavor to have two to three
suppliers capable of meeting our requirements for each key raw material. Our top 10 suppliers accounted
for 46% of total supplier spend in 2020 and, aside from a single contract covering approximately 11%, no
single supplier accounted for more than 5% of total supplier spend. In general, we pursue long-term
relationships with our primary suppliers, and certain suppliers have been supplying raw materials to
Ontex at varying levels since its founding. Our top five suppliers across several raw materials categories
have remained stable over the past ten years. Where possible, in the future we intend to further
consolidate our supplier basis with a focus on strategic integrated collaboration with our trusted suppliers.
We believe that this will maintain stability while increasing efficiency throughout the organization,
enhancing access to co-development & innovation and reducing costs for us and our supplier. When we
co-develop a material for our exclusive use with one of our suppliers, we aim to identify suitable back-up
materials readily available from other suppliers to ensure supply, without creating a copy of the proprietary
material.

The contracts we have with our raw material suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and
duration, and our raw material costs are also subject to price volatility attributable to a number of factors
beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the availability of supply (including supplier capacity
constraints); general economic conditions; commodity price fluctuations (particularly of petroleum);
demand by other industries for the same raw materials; and the availability of complementary and
substitute materials. We are focused on tightly controlling our raw material costs by carrying out reviews
and benchmarking analyses of suppliers’ pricing so as to achieve the best possible terms. Certain of our
supply agreements with fluff suppliers contain provisions that reduce our exposure to volatility in fluff
prices. We maintain in-house resources dedicated to in-depth market and cost analyses that guide our
materials purchasing. Our suppliers are required to undergo detailed onboarding procedures, including
education and acknowledgement of our compliance policies for third-party vendors, and submit to a
regular monitoring and audit program.


-----

We have a central procurement department that continuously supervises raw material procurement and
monitors our supply chain costs, which include logistics (transport and warehousing of raw materials)
and stock and procurement overheads. We manage our supply chain costs through our central IT
platform, which enables us to forecast future operational demands across our business.

In order to better control our exposure to price changes in raw materials, we have entered into hedging
arrangements. We try to hedge a portion of our propylene, polypropylene and polyethylene exposure.
However, we do not currently hedge our exposure to fluff or paper-indexed raw materials, as we have
agreed arrangements with our suppliers that allow us to contractually manage these exposures. We
maintain a hedging committee which meets quarterly to assess our hedging strategy. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative_
_Disclosure About Market Risk—Commodity Price Risk” and “—Hedging Committee”._

**Marketing and Sales**

We have 28 sales and marketing teams located across Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, Turkey, the
Middle East and Australia through which we make sales in more than 110 countries worldwide. We
believe in the power of local brands, and our direct presence in these markets allows us to easily adapt
our commercial plans and products to specific local regulations and market demands, while maintaining
a strong focus on account management. We centralize certain supporting roles at the divisional level to
leverage our institutional expertise and synergies (in areas such as product management, digital
marketing and e-commerce), but maintain strong local sales forces and marketing management.

**Marketing**

In the Europe division, given the focus on retailer brands, we do not carry out any significant direct
advertising or marketing campaigns. Rather, our retailer customers market their own brands directly to
consumers, which we support through product innovation, design differentiation, category management
(online and offline) and trade marketing campaigns. Retailer brands are increasingly viewed as real
brands and are actively promoted by retailers, and we partner with these clients to provide key support in
brand positioning and asset development (e.g. packaging, key visuals and point-of-sale materials).

In order to maintain and develop our market positions in our AMEAA markets, where we operate
predominantly as a branded business, we focus on the development of premium consumer ranges and
improvement of brand awareness and consideration through direct-to-consumer advertising (mass and
digital media) campaigns focused on brand values and differentiated product benefits. As we mostly
operate through distributors and retailers, we also focus on B2B or account marketing, working with our
customers to develop concrete category and trade marketing plans through their professional or
consumer-facing media and point of sales activation campaigns. Additionally, we support socially
responsible campaigns or events in which values like proper infant care and support, access to feminine
hygiene protection or adult incontinence awareness are promoted by authorities, health institutions or
respected consumers’ associations.

In our Healthcare division, or healthcare segments in other divisions, we are required to comply with
specific local regulations on product performance, market conditions and advertising of medical devices
(applicable to certain of our Adult Incontinence products). We focus our marketing plans on well-known
and respected Ontex brands, targeting both professional and consumer channels (primarily through digital
media) to develop brand awareness and consideration among shoppers, relatives and professionals.
Sales tools (e.g. professional leaflets and product brochures) and product sampling are critical to promote
trial and conversion. We also provide certain value-added services to customers in this division to support
healthcare professionals and institutions in reducing the cost of change, through efforts aimed at product
conversion and optimization, staff training, and managing the total cost of management platforms. We
also participate in healthcare congresses or fairs and endorse activities of medical or nurses
associations.

**Sales**

We maintain 28 sales offices globally, serving customers in more than 110 countries. General managers
and regional sales directors are responsible for defining concrete commercial targets, required resources,
and specific business key performance indicators for their respective geographies, in overall alignment
with broader divisional strategy and financial objectives.


-----

We approach large accounts and retail customers by adapting our sales process and team organization
to their organizational structures and specific needs. Consequently, our sales targets are not only focused
on the acquisition of new customers, but on the development of existing business with dedicated account
and category plans (offline and online) defined and implemented by a team of specialized key account
managers, supported by regional account managers, technical product managers, trade marketing, and
merchandisers.

The size of each sales team is based on local market structure and customer focus. Sales teams are
generally larger when they primarily support our own brands (thereby servicing multiple retailers) than
when they support retail customers promoting their own brands or third-party manufacturing
opportunities. Our Healthcare division sales teams focus on institutional buyers of Adult Incontinence
products, distributors and medical retailers (such pharmacies, drug stores or specialist medical shops).
Frequently these teams also need to visit doctors and nurses to promote the prescription or
recommendation of our products and brands. This complex and fragmented route to market requires
larger sales forces and the support of continence care specialists (nurses), facilitating conversion and
training on the optimal use of our solutions and on general elderly care.

E-commerce is acquiring a growing importance as a sales channel, and we have in place specialized
teams that work with our retail customers on the development of their own online platforms (category and
retail brand development). We also develop our own direct-to-consumer online platforms, promoting our
Ontex brands, or propose specific trade plans with specialized online distributors to increase online
distribution of our products.

**_Pricing Policy_**

Retailer brands’ prices are based on the specific customer’s price positioning in relation to an expected
index versus the “lead” brand. The analysis of the complete value chain and our customer’s expectation
on margins is critical to defining our own price and allows us to maintain a competitive position in the
negotiation or tender processes and preserve our profitability targets. Final pricing is determined on a
centralized basis (for large accounts) or locally, according to clearly identified parameters.

Healthcare tenders issued by national or regional health services, nursing home groups or medical
insurance providers are normally based on a combination of pricing (critical element) and quality scores.
There is often an indication of expected maximum prices to be respected. We base our decision on
historical prices, total value and logistical conditions, and we complete a detailed profit run study before
taking a final decision.

Pricing for our Ontex brands, especially in the consumer segment and e-commerce, are based on market
standards and intended brand positioning—for example, positioning versus the “lead” brand, as a lifestyle
brand or as a “challenger” brand to established names. We prepare price lists with centrally defined
parameters to guarantee competitiveness and profitability.

**Research and Development**

We have a proven ability to deliver product innovations, having delivered an average of 30 innovations
(e.g. product technologies new to Ontex, product upgrades and features, and range extensions) Groupwide each year since 2017. The technology “platforms” underlying our product developments are capable
of being adapted and deployed across geographies and product segments (e.g. applications across
baby diapers, Adult Incontinence products and Feminine Care fluff towels).

Our R&D team is centrally managed and has proven in-house R&D capabilities. Our R&D team consists
of over 100 professionals (product design & development specialists, lab staff, management and planning
personnel) who are principally based across four R&D centers of excellence, which are located in our
major production facilities in Belgium and Germany, and three R&D hubs (one each in Italy, Brazil and
Mexico). The R&D team is primarily responsible for the validation of new product designs, the optimization
of existing products and the product qualification of new raw materials.

The R&D team pursues a collaborative approach with our sales and marketing, legal, procurement,
engineering, quality and production teams to coordinate rapid deployment and scale-up of innovations
and product upgrades. We have unique innovation capabilities in-house, in strong collaboration with our
in-house engineering department, including a dedicated full diaper pilot line and test stands for absorbent
core development. We also have our own state-of-the-art laboratories, have established longstanding
collaboration with external laboratories, and we partner with start-ups and research institutes for selected
innovation projects.

**Intellectual Property (IP)**

The intellectual property rights in relation to our products are retained by us, rather than by our retailer
customers. It is of the utmost importance to us and our customers that we ensure that our products,
machines and manufacturing procedures do not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights. We
assess our products, machines and manufacturing procedures from a legal, regulatory and intellectual
property standpoint in order to achieve this objective.

As part of this process, we strive to keep our knowhow confidential and file for intellectual property rights
to obtain relevant protection towards third parties, safeguard our own freedom to operate and maximize
business and commercial opportunities arising therefrom. Our approach to protection of our intellectual
property varies depending on the nature of the technology we are attempting to safeguard. For
manufacturing processes and machines, we often choose to keep our knowhow and technology
confidential without any disclosure outside the company, while for product innovation we may file for
relevant intellectual property rights and thereby disclose the product technology within the relevant
application. The reason we take this differentiated approach is that product technologies may be more
easily reversed-engineered once the relevant product is placed on the market, while this is not the case
for machines and processes, which remain confidential within our production facilities. Any innovation
must still be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and we may take a different approach in certain cases
and based on our IP policy.

We mainly protect our intellectual property through patents and trademarks. We currently have
approximately 130 distinct patent families which relate to various product specifications for our absorbent
hygiene product categories—being (i) internal and external feminine hygiene, (ii) Baby Care and (iii) Adult
Incontinence products—as well as the production processes and technologies used to manufacture them.
Within these patent families, several regional and national patents have been filed and granted, and in
the ordinary course we generally have pending applications in respect of products, processes and
technologies. In total, we hold more than 450 patents worldwide. In addition to patent protection, we also
register and expand our brands and trademarks into the various territories which are or might become of
importance to Ontex. Our brands and trademarks include, among others, iD, Canbebe, Helen Harper,
Canped, Lille Healthcare, Babycharm, Baby Soft Moltex, Secondary, Climaflex, Orizon, Serenity, bbtips,
Affective, Pompom and Cremer. We further hold a total of more than 160 registered designs protecting
aesthetic aspects of several of our commercial products and features such as print designs, absorbent
core channel shapes and the like.

Further, if there is customer demand for a new product or innovation which is protected by third-party
rights, where possible we will seek to negotiate and either cross-license or purchase a license from the
relevant third party in order to be able to manufacture the product.

**Employees**

In 2020, we had an average of 9,927 full-time equivalent employees. The following table shows, for the
last three financial years, average headcount by geographical area:

We consider our relations with our employees to be good. The terms and conditions for employees,
including working hours, termination rights and benefits, are governed by standard employee contracts
together with, in certain circumstances, a variety of collective bargaining agreements. A European Works
Council was set up by us for the purpose of discharging certain requirements to inform and consult with
employees on an international level.

A majority of our employees in Belgium, France, Spain, Italy and Germany are covered by collective
bargaining agreements or represented by trade unions, local works councils or the European Works
Council. Additionally, a large portion of our workforce in Turkey, Algeria, Mexico and Brazil is covered by
collective bargaining agreements. In the Czech Republic, a minority of employees are represented by a
trade union.

While certain of our collective bargaining agreements are for an indefinite duration, others need to be
renewed from time to time. In the past five years, we have successfully concluded and/or renegotiated
collective bargaining agreements without meaningful work stoppages. Although we have not experienced
difficulties in the past in renewing our collective bargaining agreements on acceptable terms, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Should there be significant
industrial action, disruptive works council activity or disturbances across our workforce, we could
experience a disruption of operations and increased costs as a result. Although we can generally shift
production to other facilities that are not affected by industrial action, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to do so in all cases.

**Employee Incentives**

We seek to incentivize our employees in a number of ways. The principal method we employ to achieve
this is awarding key managers bonuses pursuant to our management incentive program. Under our
management incentive program, employees may receive a bonus equal to a certain percentage of their
basic salary upon the achievement of certain personal and business goals.

We also award bonuses to certain employees, in particular to our sales team, which are dependent upon
the level of sales achieved by the relevant team. In addition, we have set up a long-term incentive plan for
members of the executive management team, certain other senior managers and other persons
assimilated to these categories.

We also operate a bonus program for our plant-based staff, whereby the level of the bonus depends on
the achievement of plant-specific targets for production efficiency, quality, service level and safety.

**Pensions**

We make payments on a defined contribution basis to both state and private pension arrangements
across our operations. In addition, we operate a defined benefit insurance scheme in Belgium and we
also have an obligation to make severance payments to employees upon their retirement in France and
Turkey.

We also operate several unfunded pension arrangements in respect of our German operations. The
German operations do not fund the pension arrangements but reflect pension scheme liabilities in
company accounts on an IAS 19 basis. The pension benefits are paid by the relevant company as they
fall due.


-----

**Insurance**

We have insurance policies in place that cover liability for public and product liability, death or injury to
employees and damage to property, including buildings, plant, machinery and stock. We also have
insurance coverage for business interruption.

We work closely with our insurance brokers to ensure that we are adequately protected and to minimize
the risk of any loss. Our insurance, however, does not cover every potential risk associated with our
business. We do not carry freight insurance for our products because of the large volumes of products
transported and the relatively small monetary loss that could result from any given incident.

The Company maintains a directors and officers insurance policy covering claims that would be made
against directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries in relation to their functions. The
Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors supplementing this policy.

**Information Technology and Data**

We enable all our key business processes on 3 main enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms: one
Oracle system to support our Mexican operations; one specific SAP instance supporting Brazil; and one
central core Ontex SAP instance operating all other businesses/territories (with the exception of China,
Pakistan and Ethiopia having small systems). These main systems are hosted in professional data
centers (in Belgium for our central SAP environment and in Mexico City for our Oracle base). We recently
migrated our Brazilian SAP systems to the cloud (Microsoft Azure). None of these IT services are
outsourced, and we run these systems with internal expert IT resources located primarily in our Aalst
headquarters (Belgium), Puebla (Mexico) and Goiania (Brazil). We contract with external suppliers to
plan and execute major IT projects. All of our global sites are interconnected via a Wide Area Network
(WAN), which is controlled centrally by our expert IT infrastructure and operations (I&O) team with
standardized network equipment (such as firewalls, switches and wi-fi)

We recently created a “Digital Factory” for the design, development and implementation of new online
services, including our direct-to-consumer subscription services, our Healthcare division’s home delivery
business in Europe, our internet-enabled “connected” diaper and several Ontex brand websites. These
applications and technologies are developed in-house to ensure the best user experience for our
consumers and deliver a competitive advantage, and are fully proprietary. Our online services are run out
of AWS (Amazon) and AZURE (Microsoft) cloud systems, leveraging software development and IT
operations technics.

We also leverage a Microsoft cloud environment for our employees’ “digital workplace,” with a global
contract through which we license products and services such as Office 365, Teams, SharePoint, Outlook,
PowerBI and secured user authentication services.

Realizing the increasing exposure of many companies to cyberattacks and the potential consequences
for our business, we completed a complete cybersecurity assessment in 2019, following which we
engaged in an overhaul of our cybersecurity capabilities to limit perceived vulnerabilities. We reinforced
our security governance and established a dedicated team of cybersecurity experts led by an experienced
CISO. We defined our security roadmap to address the immediate cyber risks and implemented a number
of foundational projects required to achieve the target maturity for our cyber capabilities. This allowed us
to significantly improve our overall “IT Security Maturity Level” as measured through the industry standard
(ISO 27001-2 / NIST cybersecurity / SANS top 20 Model) and an initial audit by an independent
consultant. In the past five years we have not faced any material cyberattacks or data breaches.

**_Sustainability_**

As a leading supplier of affordable personal hygiene products, Ontex believes that sustainable business
practices contribute to genuine business success. We have an opportunity—and an obligation—to drive
positive change.

We are committed to achieving climate neutral operations by 2030 and moving towards a circular business
model. We want to create a positive impact in our supply chain and regenerate natural resources. We aim
to enhance transparency and lead the way to a fair society.


-----

By mobilizing our people, our suppliers, our customers, and our consumers, Ontex aims to actively
contribute to the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Our sustainability approach is based on 4 pillars:


###### Climate action;

 Circular solutions;


###### Building trust; and


###### Sustainable supply chain.

These four pillars form the basis of our strategy, and are all interconnected. For example, working to
implement circular solutions will have an impact on climate change. Creating transparency throughout
the supply chain will increase trust across all identified stakeholders, in our company and products.

We have taken concrete steps in furtherance of this sustainability commitment, including the reduction of
our overall carbon emissions by 15% versus 2018. We also achieved the following ESG milestones in
2020:



- Achieved 100% renewable electricity for our European plants (and 75% globally);

- Inaugurated a solar rooftop in our Segovia plant, expected to provide more than 20% of the plant’s
electricity needs;



- Achieved carbon-neutral production in two of our European plants;

- Completed an innovation project to add recycled content in our plastic bags;



- Maintained 100% certified or controlled wood-based raw materials;

- Utilized 96% organic cotton in our products;



- 86% of our main plants certified ISO14001, and 51% ISO5001;

- Awarded upgrades in our CDP Climate (B) and CDP Forest (B) scores;



- Maintained our MSCI “AA” ESG rating;

- Progressed in our goal to become a more diverse and inclusive workplace, with 28% female
management (up from 24% in 2019, and 27% in 2018);

None of our sites have been the subject of any significant environmental prosecutions for violating
environmental regulations, licenses or other requirements during the past five financial years.

**_Health and Safety_**

As stated in our Corporate Health & Safety Policy, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work
environment for all employees, contractors and visitors. This commitment also extends to ensuring that
our operations do not place local communities or the environment at risk of injury, illness or damage.

We monitor incident figures on a monthly basis at the local level and take appropriate action to address
any issues as necessary. In addition, in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we swiftly implemented
a number of measures intended to mitigate the risk of the virus in our facilities, to protect the health and
safety of our employees and to ensure the flow of our essential products. These measures were applied
uniformly across all Group facilities worldwide, and were invariably more stringent than requirements
imposed by local authorities. Our safety protocols included cleaning and disinfection routines, social
distancing rules, enhanced employee training and the provision of hand sanitizers, protective gloves and
face masks. We enabled work-from-home where possible and any corporate travel was subject to a
COVID-19 risk assessment. Employees confirmed with COVID-19 were required to quarantine for 14 days
and could only return to work after medical clearance. For their efforts in meeting this extraordinary
challenge, we awarded our plant-based employees five additional days of holiday.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are subject to legal, administrative or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.
Other than the investigations described below, we believe that none of the legal, administrative or
regulatory proceedings pending against us or with which we are threatened, individually or collectively,
will have a material adverse effect on the Group.

Provisions for legal claims amounted to €7.3 million as of December 31, 2020.

In 2018 COFECE, the Mexican antitrust authority, opened an investigation in relation to potential
anticompetitive conduct among manufacturers in the personal hygiene industry in Mexico, including
Grupo Mabe, which we acquired in 2016. The investigation relates to periods prior to our acquisition of
Mabe, and Ontex and Mabe have been proactively and fully cooperating with COFECE in its investigation

and intend to continue to do so. Based on the facts and circumstances known to it and in light of the
contractual terms of the Mabe acquisition, the Group does not expect the investigation to result in a net
financial cost to it. The Group currently believes that the disposition of the claims and disputes, individually
or in aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
of operations or liquidity.

On September 2, 2014, Ontex received a notification that the Spanish Competition Authorities (CNMC)
opened infringement proceedings against 15 companies (including three subsidiaries of the Company:
Ontex Es Holdco, S.A., Ontex Peninsular, S.A.U. and Ontex ID, S.A.U.) with respect to alleged price-fixing
and other anti-competitive commercial conditions in the Spanish market for heavy adult incontinence
products. On May 26, 2016, following the conclusion of its investigation, the CNMC issued its decision,
finding that eight companies, including Ontex’s Spanish subsidiaries, guilty of being part of a cartel. For
its involvement from 1999 to 2014, Ontex was fined €5.2 million. Ontex initiated an appeal against the
CNMC decision which remains pending. From December 31, 2016, a provision amounting to € 5.2 million
has been accounted for, which remains unadjusted as of December 31, 2020.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to_
_the Indenture. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and_
_conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements._
_Capitalized terms used in the following respective summaries and not otherwise defined in this Offering_
_Memorandum have the meanings ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**New Syndicated Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Offering, on June 23, 2021 the Issuer entered into the New Syndicated Facilities
Agreement with, among others, KBC Bank NV and Société Générale S.A. as bookrunners, the financial
institutions named therein as mandated lead arrangers, lead arrangers, arrangers and original lenders
and KBC Bank NV as agent (the “Senior Agent”). Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are also party to
the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement as guarantors. The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement will
provide for the following:

   - a €220 million senior term loan A facility (the “New Term Loan Facility”); and

   - a €250 million senior multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”
and, together with the New Term Loan Facility, the “New Syndicated Credit Facilities” (each a
“New Syndicated Credit Facility”)).

The New Term Loan Facility may be utilized by the Issuer and may be used (i) to refinance the Existing
Facilities and to pay breakage costs, redemption and/or prepayment premia (however described), accrued
but unpaid interest and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such refinancing and
the finance documents entered into under or in connection with the New Syndicated Credit Facilities (the
“Senior Facilities Finance Documents”) (including in respect of the termination of any hedging
arrangements in relation to such existing indebtedness) and (ii) for its general corporate purposes.

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by certain members of the Group (as defined in the
New Syndicated Facilities Agreement) in euros and certain other currencies readily available and freely
convertible into euro in the European interbank market (subject to obtaining the consent of all the New
Revolving Credit Facility lenders participating in the relevant utilization and risk-free interest rate terms
being in place for that currency) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit and
ancillary facilities. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be used (i) to refinance existing indebtedness
of the Group and to pay breakage costs, redemption and/or prepayment premia (however described),
accrued but unpaid interest and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such
refinancing (including in respect of the termination of any hedging arrangements in relation to such
existing indebtedness), (ii) for its general corporate purposes, (iii) to finance the working capital
requirements of the Group and (iv) to finance any acquisitions permitted under the Senior Facilities
Finance Documents.

In addition to the New Term Loan Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Syndicated
Facilities Agreement includes the ability to incur one or more uncommitted additional term or revolving
facilities (each an “Additional Facility”) subject to:

   - there being no event of default continuing at the time of the request and no event of default would
arise as a result of such Additional Facility; and

  - the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, pro forma for all established
Additional Facilities (assuming a full drawdown of all amounts available under such additional
term facility and, to the extent applied towards the financing of any permitted acquisition, such
additional revolving facility), is less than or equal to the applicable ratio of Consolidated Total Net
Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement).

**_Availability_**

The New Term Loan Facility will be available from and including the date of the New Syndicated Facilities
Agreement to and including July 31, 2021. Any amount not drawn on such date will be cancelled.


-----

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the date of the New Syndicated Facilities
Agreement until the date which is the business day one month prior to the maturity date of the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to EURIBOR and the following applicable margins:

  - 2.40% per annum in respect of loans under the New Term Loan Facility; and

  - 2.10% per annum in respect of loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility,

subject in each case to a margin ratchet based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated
EBITDA (each as defined in the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement), which may result in the total rate
of interest increasing or decreasing (as the case may be) depending on that ratio. If EURIBOR is less
than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed zero in respect of the New Syndicated Credit Facilities.

The Issuer is also generally required to pay certain other fees under the New Syndicated Credit Facilities,
including commitment, utilization and other fees. A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate
undrawn and uncanceled amount (in euro) of the New Revolving Credit Facility from the date of the New
Syndicated Facilities Agreement to the end of the availability period applicable to the New Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment
fees will be payable quarterly in arrear during the availability period applicable to the New Revolving
Credit Facility and on the date the New Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on
which the relevant lender cancels its commitment. Utilization fees are payable on drawn amounts at a per
annum rate ranging from 0.10% to 0.40% according to the percentage of the New Revolving Credit
Facility which is utilized.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The New Term Loan Facility will be repaid in full on the initial termination date, as may be extended in
accordance with the below.

In respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over maturing New Revolving Credit Facility loans. All
outstanding amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the initial termination date,
as may be extended in accordance with the below.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be
reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

The initial termination date for the New Syndicated Credit Facilities is the date falling 3 years after the
date of the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement. Subject to certain conditions, the Issuer may request
on not more than two occasions during the life of the New Syndicated Credit Facilities that the termination
date in respect of any New Syndicated Credit Facility is extended by an additional period of one year. The
termination date for the New Syndicated Credit Facilities may not extend beyond the date which is the
fifth anniversary of the date of the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de minimis
amounts) and requires mandatory prepayment in full if the shares in the Issuer cease to be listed.

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement provides that, following a change of control or disposal of
substantially all the business of the Group, a New Syndicated Credit Facilities lender may require a
prepayment in full of its participation in the outstanding New Term Loan Facility or Revolving Credit
Facility loans.

Under the terms of the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Issuer is required (i) to submit the
change of control provision at its next general meeting of shareholders for approval by its shareholders
and (ii) to provide evidence of filing of such approval with the clerk of the competent enterprise court by
no later than June 30, 2022. Failure by the Issuer to satisfy the above requirements would constitute a


-----

breach under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, respectively, and subject to the notice delivery
requirements and respective grace periods, constitute an event of default under the New Syndicated
Facilities Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and
_Guarantees—The right of holders to have their Notes repurchased upon the occurrence of a change of_
_control is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Issuer and until such time the holders will not_
_have a valid claim for the repurchase of their Notes upon a change of control” for more information and_
the relevant undertaking under the Indenture.

**_Guarantees_**

The New Syndicated Credit Facilities will benefit from substantially the same guarantees as the Notes.
Additional members of the Group are required to accede as guarantors under the New Syndicated
Facilities Agreement the extent that the aggregate of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and the
guarantors (in each case calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items and
investments in subsidiaries of any member of the Group) represents less than 70% of the Consolidated
EBITDA of the Group (the “Guarantor Cover Test”). To the extent that any member of the Group has
EBITDA in an amount of less than zero, such entity shall be treated as having EBITDA of zero for the
purposes of calculating compliance with the numerator for the Guarantor Cover Test.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains customary representations and warranties (subject
to certain agreed qualifications and with certain ones being repeated), including (but not limited to):

   - corporate representations, including status, binding obligations, non-conflict with constitutional
documents, laws or other obligations, power and authority, validity and admissibility in evidence
and governing law and enforcement;

   - no insolvency, no litigation, no breach of laws and no filing or stamp taxes;

   - no default, no misleading information and financial statements;

  - pari passu ranking;

   - not in the business of purchasing or carrying margin stock;

   - center of main interests in its jurisdiction of incorporation; and

  - no breach of anti-corruption laws, sanctions and US margin regulations.

Certain representations and warranties are made on the date of the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement
and repeated at each utilization; on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times
(including on the day on which a request is made to extend the termination date for the New Syndicated
Facilities Agreement, as set out above, and on the effective date of such extension).

**_Covenants_**

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains customary operating covenants, subject to certain
agreed exceptions, including covenants restricting the ability of certain members of the Group to:

  - make acquisitions;

  - incur indebtedness;

   - create security;

  - dispose of assets;

  - merge with other companies;

  - make a substantial change to the general nature of the business of the Group taken as a whole;

  - engage in the business of purchasing or carrying margin stock or use the proceeds from the New
Syndicated Credit Facilities for buying or carrying margin stock;

  - change center of main interests; or

   - undertake activity that could result in a breach of anti-corruption laws or sanctions and US margin
regulations.


-----

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement also requires compliance with certain affirmative covenants,
including covenants relating to:

  - maintenance of relevant authorizations;

  - compliance with laws; and

   - provision of financial and other information to the lenders.

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement will require compliance with a financial covenant consisting of
a maximum ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for each relevant period. The
ratio is based on the definitions in the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar
definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which
would allow the Majority Lenders (under and as defined in the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement) to
accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments, including (subject in certain cases to
agreed grace periods, financial thresholds and other qualifications):

  - nonpayment of amounts due under the Senior Facilities Finance Documents;

  - breach of the financial covenant or the representations and covenants relating to sanctions and
anti-corruption laws or noncompliance with other obligations under the Senior Facilities Finance
Documents;

  - inaccuracy of representation or statement when made;

   - cross defaults, including any event of default under the Notes;

  - unlawfulness or repudiation of the Senior Facilities Finance Documents;

  - insolvency, insolvency proceedings and commencement of certain creditors’ processes, such as
expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution; and

  - material adverse change.

**_Governing Law_**

The New Syndicated Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Syndicated Factoring Agreement**

**_General_**

The Issuer entered into a factoring agreement dated February 21, 2018 (the “Syndicated Factoring
**Agreement”) with BNP Paribas Fortis Factor N.V. and KBC Commercial Finance N.V. (together the**
“Factors”).

Under the terms of the Syndicated Factoring Agreement, the Factors agree to make advance payments
to the Issuer in respect of accounts receivable transferred to the Factors. The Syndicated Factoring
Agreement provides for a credit facility of up to €200 million and up to 95% of the amount of the approved
outstanding receivables on all debtors transferred to the Factors.

The other key limits are:

   - approved credit limits;

  - customer concentration; and

  - geographical concentration or exclusion.

Financing per debtor is capped at 10% of the aggregate amount of all approved outstanding receivables
transferred to the Factors, subject to certain exceptions.

All amounts advanced within the Syndicated Factoring Agreement limits are insured and without recourse
to the Group. However, the Factors may provide financing limits over and above any credit limit (but within


-----

the €200 million overall cap). Such funds are not covered by the insolvency risk coverage and are therefore
not provided on a nonrecourse basis.

**_Maturity and Amortization_**

The Syndicated Factoring Agreement carried an initial term of three years, which matured on March 20,
2021. Upon its initial maturity and pursuant to its terms, the Syndicated Factoring Agreement was
renewed automatically by tacit agreement between the parties for a new period of one year. At the end of
the current one-year term, and each subsequent one-year term for which the Syndicated Factoring
Agreement has been renewed, any party may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ notice.

**_Certain Covenants_**

The Syndicated Factoring Agreement contains certain covenants including relating to the administration
of the accounts receivable, the terms of the invoices and exchange of information.

**_Seizure_**

When there is a conservatory seizure (bewarend beslag/saisie conservatoire) on the Issuer’s assets
having an aggregate value in excess of €250,000, the amount available under the credit facility is
decreased by an amount equal to the fair market value of the assets subject to seizure after a grace
period of 30 days provided that if the Issuer has taken appropriate action within the 30-day period with a
view to the seizure being withdrawn the facility will not be decreased if the seizure is actually withdrawn
within 90 days. If there is a seizure on the debtor’s assets, that debtor is withdrawn from the finance while
the seizure is continuing.

**_Termination_**

The Syndicated Factoring Agreement provides for termination events including the following:
(i) insolvency; (ii) material breach subject to a 14-day grace period if capable of remedy; and (iii) a
change of control that is not acceptable in accordance with any Factor’s applicable internal group policies.

**_Governing Law_**

The Syndicated Factoring Agreement is governed by Belgian law.

**Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities made available to Active Indústria de Cosméticos S.A.**

**_General_**

Active Indústria de Cosméticos S.A., an indirect subsidiary of the Issuer organized under Brazilian law,
entered into three letter loan agreements dated March 22, 2019, May 8, 2019 and June 6, 2019,
respectively (together, the “Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities”) with Bank of America, N.A.

Under the terms of the Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities, Bank of America, N.A. agreed to make
available term loan facilities denominated in euros in principal amounts equal to €33.1 million, €4.5 million
and €9.4 million, respectively. The term loan facilities in each case mature on March 25, 2022, subject to
the possibility for the borrower to make optional prepayments. The term loan facilities bear interest at a
fixed rate.

**_Certain Covenants_**

The Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities contain certain covenants, including relating to the delivery of
information, the preserving and maintaining of rights and privileges and properties, the maintenance of
insurance, and anti-corruption laws. The Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities furthermore contain
negative covenants, such as in respect of liens, indebtedness, and lines of business.

**_Events of Default_**

The Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities contain customary events of default, including with respect to
the failure of making payments on the loans, the failure to perform or observe covenants,
misrepresentation, cross-default (including with respect to certain financial indebtedness of the Issuer
and its material subsidiaries), insolvency proceedings, and change of control.


-----

A change of control relates to an event or series of events by which the Issuer, and any other current,
controlling shareholders of Active Indústria de Cosméticos S.A. existing as of the date of the Bilateral
Senior Term Loan Facilities, ceases to own, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, at least 51%
of the outstanding shares of voting stock of Active Indústria de Cosméticos S.A., or shall cease to have
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of Active Indústria de
Cosméticos S.A.

**_Governing Law_**

The Bilateral Senior Term Loan Facilities are governed by the laws of Brazil. The borrower has submitted
to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States district court and each state court in the city of New
York and any appellate court from any thereof.

**Total Return Swap Agreement**

The Group entered into a total return swap agreement with a financial institution on June 1, 2015 (the
“TRS Agreement”) to hedge the risk that an increase in the public price of Ontex shares would negatively
impact future cash flows related to share-based payments in connection with the future exercise or vesting
of awards under the Group’s existing long-term incentive programs (“LTIPs”). Under the TRS Agreement,
the financial institution has purchased Ontex shares on the open market. A strike price, at which the
Company can acquire the shares at a future date, has been determined based on the average purchase
price that the financial institution paid for these shares. For the duration of the TRS Agreement, the
financial institution pays the Company the dividends it receives on the purchased shares, and the
Company pays the financial institution interest in respect of the purchased shares at a rate equal to
EURIBOR plus a margin.

The TRS Agreement can be extended in additional one-year terms at the Company’s option, and has
been extended and renewed on several occasions. Following its most recent extension, the TRS
Agreement is currently scheduled to mature in June 2022 (unless further extended in accordance with its
terms). Upon maturity of the TRS Agreement, the Company repurchases the underlying shares from the
financial institution at the predetermined strike price.

The shares purchased pursuant to the TRS are recognized as treasury shares and have been recorded
as a deduction to Group equity (at the relevant strike price) at the time of entry into the TRS. A
corresponding liability is recorded of the Group’s commitment to pay for the shares in the future. As a
result of its outstanding obligations under the TRS Agreement, the Group recognized treasury shares in
an amount of €31.2 million (representing 1,160,209 underlying shares) and a related financial liability of
€31.2 million at December 31, 2020. Because the Group takes physical delivery of the shares upon
settlement of the TRS (i.e. no net settlement), the TRS does not meet the definition of “financial
instrument” under IAS 32 / IFRS 9. Accordingly, the Group is not required to remeasure the TRS at fair
value at each accounting close date, eliminating volatility as a result of share price movements. For
further discussion of the Group’s long-term incentive programs see Note 7.28 to the audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Other Financing Arrangements**

In addition to the financing arrangements referred to above, certain members of the Group have, as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, entered into financing arrangements such as bilateral loans,
supply chain financings, recourse and non-recourse factoring, and guarantee and letter of credit facilities
in the ordinary course of their business. For certain members of the Group this also includes facilities
which have been made available to such entities but which have, as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum, not yet been drawn.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the_
_heading “Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes”, references to “we”, “our”,_
_and “us” refer to Ontex Group NV and its subsidiaries and references to the “Issuer” refer only to Ontex_
_Group NV and none of its subsidiaries._

The Issuer will issue €580.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due July 15, 2026 (the
“Notes”) under an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the
Issuer, the Initial Guarantors, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”),
and Citibank Europe plc, as paying agent. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate,
include or be subject to any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The
phrase “Notes” refers to the Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) in the Notes for as long as the Notes
are cleared through the securities settlement system operated by the National Bank of Belgium or any
successor thereto (the “NBB-SSS”).

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under “Use of Proceeds”.

Upon initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be
guaranteed by any of its Subsidiaries. As soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within 45 days
following the Issue Date, certain of the Issuer´s Subsidiaries will become parties to the Indenture and will
guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. See “—Guarantees”.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and
the Indenture. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the
Notes and the Indenture for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies
of the Indenture are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the
pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act
and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that do not Guarantee the Notes, including obligations owed to trade creditors; and

- be subject to the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s
_Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital_
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue €580.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes
will mature on July 15, 2026. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to
receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of the NBB-SSS. If the due
date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof will not be entitled
to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be
entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 3.50% per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable, in
cash, semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15,
2022, to Holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment
date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Interest will be calculated based on the
aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Notes, and shall be allocated among the Notes in
accordance with the regulations of the NBB-SSS. Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at
a rate that is 1% higher than the then applicable interest rate on the Notes.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued on the Issue Date only in dematerialized form in accordance with the Belgian
Companies and Associations Code.

The Notes will be represented exclusively by book entries in the records of the NBB-SSS and can be held
by the holders through participants in the NBB-SSS, including Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream Banking Frankfurt (“Clearstream”), who will hold interests in the Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts (the “Dematerialized Notes”). The Notes may be
held only by, and transferred only to, eligible investors referred to in Article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree
of May 26, 1994 on the deduction of withholding tax, holding their securities in an exempt securities
account that has been opened with a financial institution that is a direct or indirect participant of the
NBB-SSS, including Euroclear and Clearstream.

All interests in the Dematerialized Notes are subject to the rules and regulations of the NBB-SSS.
Ownership of interests in the Dematerialized Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons
that have accounts with Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct participants in the NBB-SSS, or
Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and
transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer as summarized below and described more
fully under “Transfer Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
the NBB-SSS will be effected by such participants pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by the NBB-SSS and its respective participants. Except
under the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, Notes will not be issued in definitive form.
Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.


-----

If definitive notes are to be issued in one of the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, the
relevant Dematerialized Notes will be converted into registered notes (the “Definitive Registered Notes”).

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes and Paying Agents for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent” and, collectively, the “Paying
_Agents”) for the Notes. Payments of principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the_
Dematerialized Notes will be made through Citibank Europe plc (the “Principal Paying Agent”) in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the NBB-SSS. The location of the Principal Paying Agent is
Ireland. The Issuer will make payments on the Dematerialized Notes to the Principal Paying Agent for
further credit to Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct participant in the NBB-SSS (as applicable)
which will, in turn, distribute such payments in accordance with its procedures. The Issuer will make all
payments in same-day funds. For additional information about payment procedures, see “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form”._

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such
Notes. However, if and for so long as Notes are listed on, and dealings in the Notes are permitted on, the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will satisfy any requirement of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange as to paying agents
and will comply with any notice requirements required under the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s listing
rules in connection with any change of Paying Agent.

The Issuer undertakes that it will at all times maintain a Paying Agent which is a participant in the
NBB-SSS.

**_Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Citibank Europe plc and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.
The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes, if any,
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Definitive
Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders
of such Notes. However, if and for so long as Notes are listed on, and dealings in the Notes are permitted
on, the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
so require, the Issuer will satisfy any requirement of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange as to registrars
and transfer agents and will comply with any notice requirements required under the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange’s listing rules in connection with any change of Registrar or Transfer Agent.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on the Issue Date
by the following Subsidiaries of the Issuer (the “Initial Guarantors”): Ontex BV, ONTEX CZ s.r.o., Ontex
France SAS, Ontex Santé France SAS, Ontex Hygieneartikel Deutschland GmbH, Ontex Mayen GmbH,
Ontex Vertrieb GmbH, Ontex Manufacturing Italy S.r.l., Serenity S.p.A., Grupo P.I. Mabe, S.A. de C.V.,
Productos Internacionales Mabe, S.A. de C.V., Ontex Peninsular, S.A.U., Ontex ID SA, Ontex Healthcare
UK Limited, Ontex Retail UK Limited, Ontex Polska sp. z o.o., Ontex Operations USA, LLC and Valor
Brands, LLC.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders,
directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted for
96%, 76% and 79%, respectively, of the Group’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA, revenue and total assets.
As of March 31, 2021, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries would have had €1,032.8 million principal amount of indebtedness (including


-----

lease liabilities), of which €580.0 million is represented by the Notes and €220.0 million is represented by
the New Term Loan Facility. There would have been no drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is a holding company and all of its revenue and EBITDA will be generated by, and its sole
material assets will comprise the securities of, its subsidiaries for which it acts as holding company and its
receivables under any intercompany loans. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including
trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries,
and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries generally will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer
and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be
effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders
(if any) of subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). On an as-adjusted basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not guarantee the
Notes would have had €109.6 million of indebtedness outstanding (including lease liabilities). Although
the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are
not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”._

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”, each Restricted
Subsidiary that guarantees the New Term Loan Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility or Public Debt
shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy
Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial
assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could
be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively
no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the
_Notes and Guarantees—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees” and_
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”.

**_Releases of Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of
the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company of such Guarantor) as
a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and other obligations under the Notes or defeasance or
discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(4) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is
unconditionally released and discharged from its obligations under the New Syndicated Credit
Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee any Public Debt of the Issuer;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”; or_

(7) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Guarantors”._

Upon the request of, and at the expense of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all reasonably necessary
actions to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to


-----

customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee
(except for releases described under clause (5) above requiring such action or consent, as applicable).

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Dematerialized Notes may be transferred in accordance with the Indenture. Ownership of interests
in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”. In
addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected by Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct participants in the NBB-SSS pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by them and their respective
participants. Dematerialized Notes cannot be transferred in denominations of less than €100,000
principal amount.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued in one of the limited circumstances described in the Indenture,
they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any
certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will
be based upon directions received by Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct participant in the
NBB-SSS, as applicable, from the owner of the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal
amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear, Clearstream or any other direct participant in the NBB-SSS, where appropriate,
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable
in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Definitive Registered Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(d) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under “Transfer Restrictions”.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenant described under the heading
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes
(the “Additional Notes”), which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in respect of
any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;


-----

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate
or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on
which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers, as applicable, with
respect to such Additional Notes.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the
_Notes”, references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes issued on the Issue_
Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as
the Notes issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material
respects to such Notes, in which case such Additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series with
such Notes and references to the Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes issued on the Issue Date
as well any such Additional Notes, as applicable.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries”. The Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants_
in the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the
Notes are not redeemable until July 15, 2023. On and after July 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following
redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and Additional Amounts (as
defined below), if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the year
indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101.750%

At any time and from time to time prior to July 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem Notes with the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 103.500% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and Additional Amounts, if any, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to
exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of
any Additional Notes); provided that:


-----

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering, and

(2) not less than 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the principal
amount of any Additional Notes but excluding any Notes held by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries)
remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

Prior to July 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes of any series, if Holders
of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender
and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a
tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not
withdrawn by Holders of the Notes of such series, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes of such series, given not
more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender
offer (other than any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender
offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date and
Additional Amounts, if any. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such
series in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, as applicable, Notes of such series
owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been tendered for the purposes of
such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

Any redemption described above may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent. If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by
the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have
been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if
any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding days that is a
Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise payable on
such redemption date if it were a Business Day for the intervening period.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Notwithstanding
anything else in the Indenture or the Notes, redemption notices may be given more than 60 days prior to
a redemption date if the notice is in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is
registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.


-----

**Redemption at Maturity**

On July 15, 2026, the Issuer will redeem the Notes, that have not been previously redeemed or purchased
and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not
including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as
applicable, will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar, as applicable, by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of the NBB-SSS,
or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are
not held through the NBB-SSS, or the NBB-SSS does not prescribe a method of selection, on a pro rata
basis or by use of a pool factor or by lot; provided, however, that, no Note of less than €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount may be redeemed. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar
will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and if and to the extent the rules
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall notify such exchange of such redemption
and, in addition to such notice, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the
Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed or otherwise transmitted, such notice
to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the
registration books of the Registrar or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of the NBB-SSS, as
applicable, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption
date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided that, for so long as any Notes are cleared through the
NBB-SSS, notices of redemption to Holders will be delivered to the NBB-SSS (and such delivery will be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph), for onward communication to the holders of the
Book-Entry Interests. The Issuer may provide in any redemption or purchase notice that payment of the
redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or
purchase may be performed by another Person.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all
Additional Amounts (as defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or
a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a
“Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of Notes would be, required
to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such
payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment


-----

of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must become effective
on or after, and must not be publicly announced prior to, the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The
foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law that becomes effective after, and
has not been publicly announced prior to, the time such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be given in accordance with the procedures described
under “Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay
such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel
of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) under or with respect
to the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(a) the Kingdom of Belgium or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein
having power to tax;

(b) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax; or

(c) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (a), (b) and (c), a
“Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor
under or with respect to any Note or any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however,
that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business for tax purposes, or maintaining a permanent establishment
in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or sale of such Note or the receipt
of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a
Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of
the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable
notice (at least 60 days before any such withholding would be payable), to provide certification,


-----

information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or
part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide
such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment made under
or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to a Holder of the Notes who, at the time of
purchase of the Notes, was not an eligible investor listed in Article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree of
May 26, 1994 (“Eligible Investor”) or to a Holder of the Notes who was such an Eligible Investor at the
time of purchase of the Notes but, for reasons within the Holder’s control, either ceased to be an
Eligible Investor or, at any relevant time on or after the time of purchase of the Notes, otherwise
failed to meet any condition for the exemption of Belgian withholding tax according to the Securities
Settlement System, as defined and organized by the law of August 6, 1993 and its implementing
Royal Decree of May 26, 1994 or to a Holder of the Notes who is such an Eligible Investor but is not
holding the Notes in dematerialized form cleared through the NBB-SSS;

(7) any Taxes that are payable with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person
other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such
Notes directly;

(8) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to a Holder of Notes as a result of such
Notes being in the form of Definitive Registered Notes that are no longer cleared through the NBBSSS; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, any amounts to be paid on the Notes by or on
behalf of the Issuer will be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an
agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations
thereunder or official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any fiscal or regulatory
legislation, rules or practices implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (any such withholding
or deduction, a “FATCA Withholding”). Neither the Issuer nor any other person will be required to pay any
Additional Amounts in respect of FATCA Withholding.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such
certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available by the
Trustee to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or any Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the


-----

Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 30 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a redemption or repurchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder or beneficial owner for) any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, transfer, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or
levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in any jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery or registration of any Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after
their issuance or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration, transfer, court or documentary
taxes, or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies becomes payable upon a
voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable law or not
necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees, the
Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) or the receipt of any payments with
respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or
additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the
Notes or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (limited, solely in the
case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with
respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of which the
payment of Additional Amounts is not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) or (5) through (8) of the first
paragraph of this covenant or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture or any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is incorporated, organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with
respect to the Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change
_of Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (in integral_
multiples of €1,000 and provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be repurchased in whole and
not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase the Notes as described under this heading_
“Change of Control” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem
all of the Notes of such series as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than
the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control
_Offer”) to each Holder of Notes or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described_
under “—Selection and Notice”, with a copy to the Trustee:


-----

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase all or any part (in integral multiples of €1,000 and provided that Notes
of €100,000 or less may only be repurchased in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on
a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if
any (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered) and the record date (the “Change of Control
_Payment Date”);_

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is
not paid, and that any Notes or any part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to
the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control
Offer;

(4) in the case of Dematerialized Notes, cancel such Dematerialized Notes in accordance with the rules
and procedures of the NBB-SSS with respect to the portion of such Dematerialized Notes or portions
thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and if and to the extent that
the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the
Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected
to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such
notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party
from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by
virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control
would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the New Syndicated Credit Facilities. In
addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New Syndicated Credit Facilities
and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreements may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also
contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—The Issuer may not_
_be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control and the occurrence_
_of certain important corporate events will not constitute a change of control”._

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a
Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not
less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice (provided that such notice is given not more than
30 days following such purchases pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above), to redeem
all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the
applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

At the next general meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer held, as ordinarily scheduled, after the date
of the Indenture, the Issuer shall submit the terms of the covenant “—Change of Control” in the Indenture
to its shareholders for approval in accordance with article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and
Associations Code (Wetboek van Venootschappen en Verenigingen / Code des Sociétés et des
_Associations). The Issuer shall, by no later than June 30, 2022, provide evidence to the Trustee that an_
extract of such shareholders’ resolution approving such covenant is filed with the clerk of the competent
enterprise court in accordance with article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—The right of
_holders to have their Notes repurchased upon the occurrence of a change of control is subject to approval_


-----

_by the shareholders of the Issuer and until such time the holders will not have a valid claim for the_
_repurchase of their Notes upon a change of control.”_

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after
giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and

in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the greater of
€550.0 million and 251.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus in the case of any refinancing of any

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) in the case of Indebtedness owing by the Issuer or a Guarantor to and held by any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor ((i) except in respect of intercompany current liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with cash management, cash pooling
or foreign exchange, working capital or tax management of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the extent legally permitted), such Indebtedness shall be unsecured
and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, and the relevant Guarantee, in
the case of a Guarantor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a
Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be deemed, in each
case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, not permitted by this clause (3);

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) outstanding on the
Issue Date and the related Guarantees; (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in
clauses (1), (3) and (4)(a) of this paragraph) outstanding or committed on the Issue Date;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted


-----

Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant
to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to this clause (5), that at the time
of such Incurrence or acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination (x) the
Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio in the first paragraph of this covenant after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition,
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness
pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such Incurrence or
acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination;

(6) Indebtedness under Hedging Obligations not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount

at any time outstanding the greater of €90.0 million and 41.0% of Consolidated EBITDA or
(b) Ordinary Course Lease Obligations;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, bid,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or

governmental, legal or regulatory requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees
or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the

obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) self-insurance obligations,
captive insurance company obligations or the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course
of business and (d) any customary treasury and/or cash management services, including treasury,

proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in
value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition;

Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than
through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions) of the Issuer, in each case,
subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the
first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon; (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(1) subject to clause (2) below, in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in

only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the New Syndicated Credit Facilities and outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant
and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of Bank Products, letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety,
performance bonds, appeal bonds, completion guarantees, cost-overrun guarantees, advance
payment bonds, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing,
Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph above or pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above and
the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness,
then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(8) (a) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance any other Indebtedness, any Indebtedness
Incurred to fund accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value or original issue discount, or any
fees, costs and expenses, including premiums, defeasance costs, indemnity fees, upfront fees or
any required additional tax gross-up amounts will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose
of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such refinancing Indebtedness is
permitted to be Incurred and (b) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case
of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of
the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and/or capitalized interest,
accreted value or original issue discount and any fees, costs and expenses, including premiums,
defeasance costs, indemnity fees, upfront fees and any required additional tax gross-up amounts, in
connection with such refinancing; and

(9) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to
Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”, the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
or use of clauses (1) through (15) of the immediately preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings
and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount
thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto on such date, any borrowing
or re-borrowing thereunder (and the. issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the


-----

committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be
the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture, and, to
the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (15) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be
deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such
amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and, in each case, the
Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification
of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed
to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”. Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any_
date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness.

If on any date an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first
committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro,
and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject
to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account
the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within
one year of the date of such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement or (b) of or with respect to any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause
(3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”));

makes such Restricted Payment:

(a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately
thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma

subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments

covenant) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock)
or Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market
value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or

Issuer (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or through an Excluded Contribution);
_provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as_
determined in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph) of property or assets or of

(18) Restricted Payments made in connection with, or as part of, the Transactions.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any
non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Issuer
acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except
(a) Permitted Liens or (b) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the
Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally
and ratably with, or prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness), the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged under any one or more of the following circumstances.

(1) In connection with any sale or other disposition of the property or assets which are subject to such
Lien to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does


-----

not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;_

(2) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which such Lien relates;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or
discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or

(5) in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”.

At the request of and at the expense of the Issuer, the Trustee will take all reasonably necessary action
required to effectuate any release of a Lien securing the Notes and the Guarantees and Incurred pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Any such
release (other than a release described in clause (3)) of the second paragraph of this covenant will be
effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in
the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property or assets securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to
any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any payment blockage or standstill requirements to) loans or advances
made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (other than the New Syndicated
Credit Facilities) or any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on
the Issue Date or (b) the Indenture, the Notes or the New Syndicated Credit Facilities;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person, or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and outstanding on such
date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer (as
defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of


-----

such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect
to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement, instrument, amendment supplement
or other modification are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole
than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Lease Obligations
permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired, constructed, improved, leased, rented or installed, or any encumbrance or
restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or
transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to
a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the

and instruments;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (1) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
New Syndicated Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or
(2) the Issuer determines in good faith at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Permitted Recourse

Recourse Receivables Financing; and

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”._

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not
less than the fair market value of the assets sold (such fair market value to be determined on the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value), as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors; and

(2) other than with respect to a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Investment Grade Securities;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if incurred since the date of the latest
balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet or the notes thereto) (other
than Subordinated Debt), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the
Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such
Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (C), (D), (E) or (F) of the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(v) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons
that are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vi) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of €60.0 million and 28.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(vii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vi) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of
the Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (H) below)
of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
Notes or Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) at a price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes or such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase
or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness
that is secured by a Lien on property or assets of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (in


-----

each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that
the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Public Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant to
clause (ii) only if the Issuer (a) makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to
Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal
amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such
Indebtedness (other than the Notes) or (b) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on
an equal ratable basis with any such Public Debt repaid pursuant to clause (ii) by, at its option,
redeeming Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or purchasing Notes through open
market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par);

(B) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the record date to receive interest due on the interest payment date) or redeem Notes
pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture or make an Asset Disposition Offer to all
Holders of Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful
in a Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that a binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until
the earlier of (x) the date on which such prepayment, repayment, purchase, redemption, investment,
acquisition or capital expenditure is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 365 day period, if such prepayment, repayment, purchase, redemption,
investment, acquisition or capital expenditure has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds”. Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily_
reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise apply such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366[th] day (or the 546[th] day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into)
after the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such
Net Available Cash, or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds €30.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer
(“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any
such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of
the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes equal to (and, in the case of any Pari
Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and
100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and


-----

other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within
the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such
Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than
five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari_
Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has
been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later
than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions
of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in
excess of the greater of €10.0 million and 5.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€30.0 million and 14.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the Board of Directors of the
Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:


-----

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9) of
the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any
Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11)
and (17) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of costs, taxes and expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or
controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any
payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on
the Issue Date or described in “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions” in the
Offering Memorandum, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the
other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) any transaction with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary solely due
to the fact that a director or officer or member of management of such Person is also a director,
officer or member of management of, or employee of, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that such director or officer abstains from voting as a director or officer of the_
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (as the case may be) on any matter involving such other Person;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in
or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock, or Subordinated Shareholder Funding;
_provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding_
are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable
determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture;


-----

(11) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Permitted Recourse
Receivables Financing; and

(12) any transactions in respect of which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a written opinion
(in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor
stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial
point of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable than could reasonably have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2021, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable: (i) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operation, financial
condition, adjusted EBITDA and liquidity and capital resources; (ii) unaudited pro forma income
statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma
financial information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2), (3) or (4) of this
paragraph) (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense); (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer
as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent fiscal year, including appropriate footnotes
to such financial statements, and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer and all material
affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; and (v) a description of
material operational risk factors;

(2) within 60 days after the end of the first fiscal half-year in each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with
the fiscal half-year ending June 30, 2022, semi-annual financial statements of the Issuer containing
the following information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the
end of such half-year and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for such halfyear and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited
_pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory_
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of such half-year (and unless such pro forma financial information has been provided in a
previous report pursuant to clause (1), (3) or (4) of this paragraph) (provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense);
(iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, adjusted EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt
instruments since the most recent report; and (v) any material changes to the risk factors disclosed
in the most recent annual report;

(3) within 60 days after the end of the first and the third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer,
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, a recent trading update setting out
consolidated net debt, consolidated revenue and consolidated EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA (each
as defined by the Issuer) as at the end of and for such fiscal quarter; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at
the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above will not be required to:_
(i) include separate financial statements for any Restricted Subsidiaries or any disclosure with respect to
the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the
Offering Memorandum or (ii) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
and provided further that the Issuer will be deemed to have provided the information set forth in clauses
(1) through (4) of this paragraph if it has posted such information to its company website and such
information is publicly available in accordance with Belgian Listed Company Requirements.


-----

So long as the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on Euronext Brussels or another stock
exchange and the Issuer complies with the Belgian Listed Company Requirements, to the extent that
such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual and semi-annual
financial reports, information, documents and other reports in accordance with the Belgian Listed
Company Requirements, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in
clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant if, on or promptly following the date on
which the Issuer makes publicly available such annual or semi-annual financial reports, information,
documents or other reports, the Issuer also makes publicly available English language translations
thereof.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s total revenue or
consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed two full consecutive fiscal half-years for which
annual or semi-annual financial reports or information have been furnished to Holders.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective Holders of the Notes copies of all
reports furnished pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this covenant on the Issuer’s website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent
basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided,
_however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may in the event of a change in_
IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer, then the semi-annual and annual financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited
financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its subsidiaries,
which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenues, consolidated EBITDA, net income, cash,
total assets, total debt and interest expense.

For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect from time to time,
without giving effect to the proviso in the second sentence of the definition thereof.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for
so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision
of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures),
for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any Permissible Jurisdiction, or the United States of America, any State of
the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway


-----

or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all
the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer would be able to
Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Successor Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of
any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness
with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be
the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Indenture; provided, however, that in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the
Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if
the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
Person);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of
such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless (in the case of clauses (1), (2) and (3)):

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor;


-----

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the
Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case, other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibitions in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation
of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent the
Issuer determines in good faith that such limitations are reasonably necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including, without limitation, those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance,
thin capitalization or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or
other considerations under applicable law.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving
entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume all of the obligations of the
Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered
in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and its obligations under clauses (1) and (4) under the
heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form
of such entity, provided that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (A) and
(B) under the heading “—The Guarantors”, as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Similar Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
“Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;


-----

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—the Issuer”;_

(7) “—Lines of Business”; and

(8) “—Additional Guarantees”.

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no
action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture_
but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness
Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor
any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after the Reversion Date as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the
Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. In the event of the occurrence of a Suspension
Event, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this
caption have been satisfied, provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of
the covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obligated to notify
Holders of such event. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an
Investment Grade Status.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the New Syndicated Credit Facilities (or any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or any Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a
Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the
Guarantee is incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior to
or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however,
that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for
so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary.

Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Guarantees—
_Releases of the Guarantees”. A Guarantee of an additional Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is
no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such
Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee
shall take all reasonably necessary actions to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.


-----

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the Offering Memorandum._

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding;
_provided that, if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to_
the delisting of the Notes from the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and thereafter
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another recognized stock
exchange.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection
with a Limited Condition Transaction, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default
or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date on which the definitive agreements for
such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a
_pro forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and the other transactions to be_
entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Transaction (and not for purposes of
any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets
or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination
and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets or ratios
will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether such Limited Condition Transaction and the related transactions are permitted under
the Indenture and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects to have such
determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on
the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any
baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of
such Limited Condition Transaction.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note issued under the Indenture
when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Consolidation and Merger”;

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 30 days after written notice by
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the
provisions described under the caption “—Change of Control” (other than the failure to purchase
Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(5) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice by
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its
agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes (other than a default in performance, or breach,
of a covenant or agreement which is specifically addressed in clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) above);

(6) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default
_provision”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, aggregates in excess of €60.0 million;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(8) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of €60.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged
liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the
judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”); and

(9) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee default provision”).

However, a Default under clause (6) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to such clause (6) or (8), the Issuer does not cure such Default
within the time specified in such clause (6) or (8), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (7) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of
such Holders shall, subject to its rights and protections in the Indenture, declare the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration,
such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. The
Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a written notice of
any event which is in fact such a Default is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture. In the
event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(6) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes
shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (6) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within
30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (7) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium,


-----

interest or Additional Amounts, if any, other than pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration) and rescind any acceleration with respect to such Notes and
its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to
the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the offer of security
and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against all losses, liabilities and expenses which may arise by taking or omitting to take such action. The
Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within
60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to
the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether
the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another Default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also
be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with
the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery
of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such
delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It


-----

may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in
such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an
indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

The Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and any Default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of Holders
holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, then
outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts,
if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement
of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
(i) adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or (ii) amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder except, in the case of clause (ii), to the extent that the Issuer or the applicable Payor
agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of any withholding or deduction required in
respect of such Taxes;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver
of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Trustee may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right
or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits of the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Notes Documents;


-----

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”, to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any
Guarantee or any amendment with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or amendment is provided for under the Indenture;

(7) conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Notes” to
the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof; or

(9) to the extent necessary to provide for the assumption of any successor to the NBB-SSS or to the
extent necessary to comply with the rules and regulations of the NBB-SSS or any successor thereto.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under any Notes Document by any
Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange
so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a
daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort).
Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In addition, for so long as any the Notes are cleared
through the NBB-SSS, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer
to the NBB-SSS for onward communication to the Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the Defeasance Trust (as defined below), the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
and the Registrar and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and the segregation and holding
of such payments.

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the operation of the payment
default provision, the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee default provision described
under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).


-----

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (5), (6), (7) (with respect only to the
Significant Subsidiaries), (8) or (9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “Defeasance
Trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this
purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof
sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes have been delivered to the Paying Agent for
cancellation or have otherwise been cancelled in accordance with the rules of the NBB-SSS; or (b) all
Notes that have not been cancelled in accordance with subclause (1)(a) (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for
this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof,
as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not
previously cancelled in accordance with subclause (1)(a), for principal, premium, if any, and interest to
the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds
deposited towards the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be;
and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to
the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with
the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the


-----

Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public
policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set
forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent person would use in
conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of
the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Note, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflicting interest (as
such term is used in the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended) that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may
remove the Trustee, or any Holder that has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes or
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published
in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger
_Wort) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language_
newspaper having general circulation in Europe. In addition, for so long as the Notes are cleared through
the NBB-SSS, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to the
NBB-SSS for onward communication to the Holders. Such notices may also be published on the website
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) in lieu of publication in the Luxemburger Wort so
long as the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange allow.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if
so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect
in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in
the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as the
Notes are cleared through the NBB-SSS, notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered via the
NBB-SSS in lieu of notice via first-class mail.


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, including damages.
Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or of the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer or any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to
be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor,
as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so
received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
the Indenture, any Note or any Guarantee, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify them
against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of
making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie
evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of
action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under the Indenture,
any Note or any Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the
Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof will be approved, and settlement of Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States.

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation
Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such
period (taking into account expense and cost savings and synergies resulting from any such disposal,
as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer, provided
that such expense and cost savings and synergies are reasonably anticipated to be realized within

giving effect to all such expense and cost savings and synergies));

(1) to purchase any such primary obligation or any property constituting direct or indirect security
therefor;

(2) to advance or supply funds:

receivables), notes, letters of credit or other Indebtedness, in each case, as amended, restated, modified,

_less the amount of cash, Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Investment Grade Securities_

part, in each case on or prior to the date that is the earlier of (a) the Stated Maturity of the Notes or (b) the
date on which there are no Notes outstanding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Capital
Stock that would constitute Disqualified Stock solely because the holders of the Capital Stock have the
right to require the issuer thereof to repurchase such Capital Stock upon the occurrence of a change of

provide that the issuer thereof may not repurchase or redeem any such Capital Stock pursuant to such
provisions unless such repurchase or redemption complies with the covenant described above under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments”. For purposes of this definition, the amount of
Disqualified Stock which does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with
the terms of such Disqualified Stock as if such Disqualified Stock were purchased on any date on which
Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based
upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified Stock, such fair market value shall be

prior to such date will be deemed to be Disqualified Stock.

to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any

then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good
faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of such Person) to such incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement, extinguishment or other
discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of

accounting or financial officer of such Person), including in respect of expense and cost savings and


-----

synergies which are reasonably anticipated to be realized within the next 18 months following the
Calculation Date and provided that such expense and cost savings and synergies do not exceed
25% of the applicable Consolidated EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA and after giving effect to all such expense and cost savings and synergies) as if such
Purchase had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;

IFRS, and operations or businesses or groups of assets constituting a business or operating unit
(and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded;

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS,
and operations or businesses or groups of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes will be issued in dematerialized form in accordance with the Belgian Companies and
Associations Code. The Notes cannot be physically delivered. The Notes will be represented exclusively
by book entries in the records of the NBB-SSS operated by the NBB or any successor thereof. Access to
the NBB-SSS is available through Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants.

Ownership of interests in the Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear, Clearstream and any other NBB Participant or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants will hold interests in
the Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names
on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below,
Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear, Clearstream and any other NBB Participants and their
participants. The Book-Entry Interests will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may
impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.

In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and any other NBB
Participant and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the other
NBB Participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of Notes.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates will have any
responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Notes**

In the event that any Note is redeemed, Euroclear, Clearstream and any other NBB Participant, as
applicable, will redeem the Book-Entry Interests in such Note from the amount received by them in
respect of the redemption of such Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear, Clearstream and any
other NBB Participant, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Note.

**Payments on the Notes**

All payments required to be made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) will be made through the NBB-SSS, Euroclear, Clearstream
and any other NBB Participant which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with
their respective customary procedures. The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be
discharged by payment to the NBB in respect of each amount so paid.

The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants. Payments by participants
to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.

Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for the proper performance by the NBB-SSS or its participants (including
Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants) of their obligations under their respective rules
and operating procedures. A holder of Notes must rely on the procedures of the NBB-SSS, Euroclear,
Clearstream and the other NBB Participants to receive payments under the Notes. The Issuer will have
no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, the Notes within
the NBB-SSS.

The Notes may be held only by, and transferred only to, eligible investors referred to in Article 4 of the
Belgian Royal Decree of May 26, 1994 on the deduction of withholding tax, holding their securities in an
exempt securities account that has been opened with a financial institution that is a direct or indirect
participant of the NBB-SSS, including Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants.


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Notes,
will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the “Holders”) through Euroclear, Clearstream and any
other NBB Participant in Euros.

**Transfers**

Transfers between direct participants in the NBB-SSS will be effected in accordance with the participants’
rules and will be settled in immediately available funds.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only as described
under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the relevant
Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. Please see “Notice to
_Investors”._

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will only receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

(i) if the Notes are held on behalf of the NBB and its participants (including Euroclear, Clearstream
and the other NBB Participants) or any alternative clearing system appointed pursuant to the
Notes and such clearing system is closed for business for a continuous period of fourteen days
(other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention permanently to cease
business or has in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available; or

(ii) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants following an event of default under the
Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will instruct the NBB to cancel the relevant Notes and the Registrar will issue
Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations,
requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants or the Issuer (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by
such Indenture or applicable law. The Issuer will bear the cost in relation to such exchange. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall interests in the Notes be represented by securities in bearer form.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall be
entitled to treat the registered holder of any Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be
liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants, as applicable.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and
any other NBB Participant, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and
procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement
system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, any
Guarantor nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of
15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed
for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also,
we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which
the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer.


-----

In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among
other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture.
We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note
has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met.
The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to
furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or any
Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for its expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered
Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered
Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. Please see “Notice to Investors”. Payment of principal, any
repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the
Issuer’s Paying Agent in Dublin so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
the rules of such exchange so require.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to the NBB Participants: the NBB Participants hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear, Clearstream and the other NBB Participants is also available to others such
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with Euroclear, Clearstream or other NBB Participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because NBB Participants can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear, Clearstream or other NBB Participant systems,
or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may
be limited.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes
will, therefore, be required to be settled in immediately available funds.

Although NBB Participants currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Notes among participants in the NBB Participants, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued
or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Registrar or the Paying Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by the NBB Participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Euros. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear, Clearstream or other NBB Participant holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear, Clearstream or another NBB
Participant and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is
important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and
the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

If Definitive Registered Notes are delivered, it will no longer be possible to trade such notes through
Euroclear, Clearstream and any other NBB Participant.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a general discussion of certain Belgian withholding tax considerations that may be_
_relevant to prospective purchasers of the Notes. This summary is based on the laws in force and_
_interpretations thereof in Belgium as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and is subject to any_
_changes in law that may take effect after such date, possibly with a retroactive effect. It does not purport_
_to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to_
_purchase, hold or dispose of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their_
_tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of_
_a purchase of Notes, including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium,_
_if any, on and upon the sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

**Belgian withholding tax**

Payments of interest and principal under the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer may be made without
deduction of withholding tax in respect of the Notes if and as long as at the moment of payment or
attribution of interest they are held by certain eligible investors (the “Eligible Investors”, see hereinafter)
in an exempt securities account (an “Exempt Account”) that has been opened with a financial institution
that is a direct or indirect participant (a “Participant”) in the settlement system operated by the National
Bank of Belgium (the “NBB-SSS”). Euroclear and Clearstream are directly or indirectly Participants for
this purpose.

In this regard, “interest” means (i) the periodic interest income, (ii) any amount paid by or on behalf of the
Issuer in excess of the Issue Price in respect of the relevant Notes (whether or not on the Final Maturity
Date) and, (iii) in case of a disposal of the Notes between two interest payment dates, the pro rata part
of accrued interest corresponding to the holding period.

Holding the Notes through the NBB-SSS enables Eligible Investors to receive the gross interest income
on their Notes and to transfer the Notes on a gross basis.

Participants to the NBB-SSS must enter the Notes which they hold on behalf of Eligible Investors in an
Exempt Account.

Eligible Investors are those entities referred to in Article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree of May 26, 1994
on the deduction of withholding tax (koninklijk besluit van 26 mei 1994 over de inhouding en de vergoeding
_van de roerende voorheffing/arrêté royal du 26 mai 1994 relatif à la perception et à la bonification du_
_précompte mobilier) (as amended from time to time) which include, inter alia:_

   - Belgian corporations subject to Belgian corporate income tax as referred to in Article 2, §1, 5°, b)
of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992 (wetboek van de inkomstenbelastingen 1992/code des
_impôts sur les revenus 1992);_

   - institutions, associations or companies specified in Article 2, §3 of the Law of July 9, 1975 on the
control of insurance companies other than those referred to in 1° and 3° subject to the application
of Article 262, 1° and 5° of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992;

   - state regulated institutions (parastatalen/institutions parastatales) for social security, or institutions
which are assimilated therewith, provided for in Article 105, 2º of the Royal Decree of August 27,
1993 implementing the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992 (koninklijk besluit tot uitvoering van het
_wetboek inkomstenbelastingen 1992/arrêté royal d’exécution du code des impôts sur les revenus_
_1992);_

   - non-resident investors whose holding of the Notes is not connected to a professional activity in
Belgium, referred to in Article 105, 5º of the same decree;

   - Belgian qualifying investment funds, recognized in the framework of pension savings, provided for
in Article 115 of the same decree;

  - taxpayers provided for in Article 227, 2º of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992 which have used
the income generating capital for the exercise of their professional activities in Belgium and which
are subject to non-resident income tax pursuant to Article 233 of the same code;

  - the Belgian State in respect of investments which are exempt from withholding tax in accordance
with Article 265 of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992;


-----

   - collective investment funds governed by foreign law which are an indivisible estate managed by a
management company for the account of the participants, provided the fund units are not offered
publicly in Belgium or traded in Belgium; and

   - Belgian resident corporations, not provided for under (i) above, when their activities exclusively or
principally consist of the granting of credits and loans.

Eligible Investors do not include, inter alios, Belgian resident investors who are individuals or non-profit
making organizations, other than those mentioned under (ii) and (iii) above.

The above categories only summarize the detailed definitions contained in Article 4 of the Royal Decree
of May 26, 1994, as amended, to which investors should refer for a precise description of the relevant
eligibility rules.

Upon opening of an Exempt Account, an Eligible Investor is required to provide the Participant with a
statement of its eligible status on a form approved by the Minister of Finance. There is no ongoing
declaration requirement to the NBB-SSS as to the eligible status (although Eligible Investors must inform
the Participants of any changes to the information contained in the statement on their tax eligible status).
However, Participants are required to annually provide the National Bank of Belgium with listings of
investors who have held an Exempt Account during the preceding calendar year.

An Exempt Account may be opened with a Participant by an intermediary (an “Intermediary”) in respect
of Notes that the Intermediary holds for the account of its clients (the “Beneficial Owners”), provided
that each Beneficial Owner is an Eligible Investor. In such case, the Intermediary must deliver to the
Participant a statement on a form approved by the Minister of Finance confirming that (i) the Intermediary
is itself an Eligible Investor and (ii) the Beneficial Owners holding their Notes through it are also Eligible
Investors. A Beneficial Owner is also required to deliver a statement of its eligible status to the
Intermediary.

These identification requirements do not apply to Notes held in Euroclear, Clearstream or any other
central securities depository (as defined in Article 2, 1, 1 of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of July 23, 2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union
and on central securities depositories (“CSD”)) as Participants to the NBB-SSS (each a “NBB-CSD”),
provided that the relevant NBB-CSD (i) only holds an Exempt Account and (ii) is able to identify the
holders for whom they hold Notes in such account. For the identification requirements not to apply, it is
furthermore required that the contracts which were concluded by the relevant NBB-CSD as Participants
include the commitment that all their clients, holder of an account, are Eligible Investors.

**Belgian tax on income and capital gains**

**_Belgian resident individuals_**

The Notes may only be held by Eligible Investors.

Consequently, the Notes may not be held by Belgian resident individuals as they do not qualify as Eligible
Investors.

**_Belgian resident companies_**

Interest attributed or paid to corporate holders of Notes who are Belgian residents for tax purposes, i.e.
which are subject to the Belgian Corporate Income Tax (vennootschapsbelasting/impôt des sociétés), as
well as capital gains realized upon the disposal of the Notes, are taxable at the ordinary corporate
income tax rate of in principle 25 per cent. Subject to certain conditions, small and medium-sized
companies (as defined in Article 1:24, § 1 to § 6 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code) are
taxable at the reduced corporate income tax rate of 20 per cent. for the first EUR 100,000 of their taxable
base.

Capital losses realized upon the sale of the Notes are in principle tax deductible.

Other tax rules apply to investment companies within the meaning of Article 185bis of the Belgian Income
Tax Code 1992.

**_Belgian resident legal entities_**

Belgian legal entities subject to Belgian legal entities tax (rechtspersonenbelasting/impôt des personnes
_morales) which qualify as Eligible Investors and which consequently have received gross interest income,_


-----

are required to declare and pay a 30 per cent. withholding tax to the Belgian tax authorities themselves
(which withholding tax then generally also constitutes the final taxation in the hands of the relevant
investors).

Capital gains realized on the sale of the Notes are in principle tax exempt, unless the capital gains qualify
as interest (as defined in Section “Belgian withholding tax”). Capital losses are in principle not tax
deductible.

**_Organisations for Financing Pensions_**

Interest and capital gains derived by Organisations for Financing Pensions (Organismen voor de
_Financiering van Pensioenen/Organismes de Financement de Pensions) within the meaning of the Law_
of October 27, 2006 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision
(Wet van 27 oktober 2006 betreffende het toezicht op de instellingen voor bedrijfspensioenvoorzieningen/
_Loi du 27 octobre 2006 relative au contrôle des institutions de retraite professionnelle), are in principle_
exempt from Belgian corporate income tax. Capital losses are in principle not tax deductible.

Subject to certain conditions, any Belgian withholding tax that has been levied can be credited against
any corporate income tax due and any excess amount is in principle refundable.

**_Non-residents_**

Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Belgium for Belgian tax purposes and who are not holding the
Notes through a Belgian permanent establishment and do not invest the Notes in the course of their
Belgian professional activity will in principle not incur or become liable for any Belgian tax on interest
income or capital gains by reason only of the acquisition or disposal of the Notes provided that they
qualify as Eligible Investors and that they hold their Notes in an Exempt Account.

**Tax on stock exchange transactions and tax on the repurchase transactions**

A tax on stock exchange transactions (taks op de beursverrichtingen/taxe sur les opérations de bourse)
will be levied on the acquisition and disposal of Notes on the secondary market if such transaction is
either entered into or carried out in Belgium through a professional intermediary.

The rate applicable for secondary sales and purchases through a professional intermediary is 0.12 per
cent., with a maximum amount of EUR 1,300 per transaction and per party and collected by the
professional intermediary. The tax is due separately from each party to any such transaction, i.e., the
seller (transferor) and the purchaser (transferee), both collected by the professional intermediary.

The acquisition of Notes upon their issuance (primary market) is not subject to the tax on stock exchange
transactions.

Pursuant to the Law of December 25, 2016 on access to the activity of investment services and on the
legal status and supervision of portfolio management and investment advice companies, the scope of
application of the tax on stock exchange transactions has been extended as of January 1, 2017 to
secondary market transactions of which the order is directly or indirectly made to a professional
intermediary established outside of Belgium by (i) a private individual with habitual residence in Belgium
or (ii) a legal entity for the account of its seat or establishment in Belgium (both referred to as a “Belgian
**Investor”). In such case, the tax on stock exchange transactions is due by the ordering private individual**
or legal entity (who will be responsible for the filing of a stock exchange tax return and for the timely
payment of the amount of stock exchange tax due) unless that individual or entity can demonstrate that
the tax on stock exchange transactions due has already been paid by the professional intermediary
established outside Belgium. In the latter case, the foreign professional intermediary also has to provide
each client (which gives such intermediary an order) with a qualifying order statement (borderel/
_bordereau), at the latest on the business day after the day on which the relevant transaction was realized._
The qualifying order statements must be numbered in series and duplicates must be retained by the
financial intermediary. A duplicate can be replaced by a qualifying agent day-to-day listing, numbered in
series. Alternatively, professional intermediaries established outside Belgium have the possibility to
appoint a stock exchange tax representative in Belgium, subject to certain conditions and formalities (a
“Stock Exchange Tax Representative”). Such Stock Exchange Tax Representative will then be liable
toward the Belgian Treasury for the tax on stock exchange transactions on behalf of clients that fall within
one of the aforementioned categories (provided that these clients do not qualify as exempt persons for
stock exchange tax purposes—see below) and to comply with the reporting obligations and the


-----

obligations relating to the order statement (borderel/bordereau) in that respect. If such a Stock Exchange
Tax Representative has paid the tax on stock exchange transactions due, the Belgian Investor will, as per
the above, no longer be the statutory debtor of the tax on stock exchange transactions.

A tax on repurchase transactions (taks op de reportverrichtingen/taxe sur les reports) at the rate of 0.085
per cent. will be due from each party to any such transaction entered into or settled in Belgium in which
a stockbroker acts for either party (with a maximum amount of EUR 1,300 per transaction and per party).

However, neither of the taxes referred to above will be payable by exempt persons acting for their own
account, including investors who are not Belgian residents provided they deliver an attestation to the
financial intermediary in Belgium confirming their non-resident status, and certain Belgian institutional
investors as defined in Article 126/1 2° of the code of miscellaneous duties and taxes (wetboek diverse
_rechten en taksen/code des droits et taxes divers) for the tax on stock exchange transactions and_
Article 139, second paragraph of the same Code for the tax on repurchase transactions.

As stated below, the European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common
financial transactions tax (the “FTT”). The proposal currently stipulates that once the FTT enters into
force, the participating Member States shall not maintain or introduce taxes on financial transactions
other than the FTT (or VAT as provided in the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on
the common system of value added tax). For Belgium, the tax on stock exchange transactions and the
tax on repurchase transactions should thus be abolished once the FTT enters into force.

The proposal is still subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and therefore may
be changed at any time.

**New Belgian annual tax on securities accounts**

Pursuant to the law of February 17, 2021 as published in the Belgian Official Gazette on February 25,
2021, a new indirect tax of 0.15% on securities accounts has been introduced (the “Tax on Securities
**Accounts”).**

The Tax on Securities Accounts applies to securities accounts held by resident individuals, companies
and legal entities, irrespective as to whether these accounts are held with a financial intermediary which
is incorporated or established in Belgium or abroad. As to non-residents individuals, companies and legal
entities, the Tax on Securities Accounts applies to securities accounts held with a financial intermediary
incorporated or established in Belgium and to securities accounts held by non-residents through a Belgian
establishment irrespective as to whether these accounts are held with a financial intermediary
incorporated or established in Belgium or abroad. Pursuant to certain double tax treaties, Belgium has
however no right to tax capital. Hence, to the extent the Tax on Securities Accounts is viewed as a tax on
capital within the meaning of these double tax treaties, treaty protection may, subject to certain conditions,
be claimed. As to specific types of regulated entities, the Tax on Securities Accounts is not due on
securities accounts held by in the context of their own professional activity and for their own account.

A financial intermediary is defined as (i) the National Bank of Belgium, the European Central Bank and
foreign central banks performing similar functions, (ii) a central securities depository included in
Article 198/1, §6, 12° of the Belgian Income Tax Code, (iii) a credit institution or a stockbroking firm as
defined by Article 1, §3 of the Law of April 25, 2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions
and investment companies and (vi) the investment companies as defined by Article 3, §1 of the Law of
October 25, 2016 on access to the activity of investment services and on the legal status and supervision
of portfolio management and investment advice companies, which are, pursuant to national law, admitted
to hold financial instruments for the account of customers.

The Tax on Securities Accounts is due on the average value of qualifying financial instruments held on
one or more securities accounts during a reference period of twelve consecutive months starting in
principle on 1 October and ending on September 30 of the subsequent year. The first reference period
started on February 26, 2021 and will end on September 30, 2021. Qualifying financial instruments are
financial instruments as referred to in Article 2, 1° of the Law of August 2, 2002 on the supervision of the
financial sector and on financial services (including not only shares, bonds and Notes, but also
derivatives), as well as cash amounts, provided they are held on a securities account.

No Tax on Securities Accounts is due provided the average value of the qualifying financial instruments
held on the relevant securities account amounts to less than EUR 1 million during the relevant reference
period. If, however, said average value amounts to EUR 1 million or more, the Tax on Securities Accounts


-----

will be due on the average value of the qualifying financial instruments on those accounts during the
relevant reference period and, hence, not only on the part which exceeds the EUR 1 million threshold. In
this respect, each securities account is assessed separately. When multiple holders hold a securities
account, each holder shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the tax and each holder may
fulfil the declaration requirements for all holders. Finally, the amount of the Tax on the Securities Accounts
is limited to 10% of the difference between the average value of the qualifying financial instruments on
the relevant securities accounts and EUR 1 million. Certain anti-abuse provisions are provided which
apply retroactively as from October 30, 2020.

Prospective holders of Notes are advised to follow up and seek their own professional advice in relation
to this new annual tax on securities accounts and the possible impact thereof on their own personal tax
position.

**Common Reporting Standard**

Following recent international developments, the exchange of information will be governed by the
Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”).

On December 10, 2020, 110 jurisdictions signed the multilateral competent authority agreement
(“MCAA”), which is a multilateral framework agreement to automatically exchange financial and personal
information, with the subsequent bilateral exchanges coming into effect between those signatories that
file the subsequent notifications.

Under CRS, financial institutions resident in a CRS country are required to report, according to a due
diligence standard, financial information with respect to reportable accounts, which includes interest,
dividends, account balance or value, income from certain insurance products, sales proceeds from
financial assets and other income generated with respect to assets held in the account or payments
made with respect to the account. Reportable accounts include accounts held by individuals and entities
(which includes trusts and foundations) with fiscal residence in another CRS country. The standard
includes a requirement to look through passive entities to report on the relevant controlling persons.

On December 9, 2014, EU Member States adopted Directive 2014/107/EU on administrative cooperation
in direct taxation (“DAC”), which provides for mandatory automatic exchange of financial information as
foreseen in CRS. DAC amends the previous Directive on administrative cooperation in direct taxation,
Directive 2011/16/EU.

The Belgian government has implemented the DAC, respectively the Common Reporting Standard, per
the law of December 16, 2015 regarding the exchange of information on financial accounts by Belgian
financial institutions and by the Belgian tax administration, in the context of an automatic exchange of
information on an international level and for tax purposes (the “Law of December 16, 2015”).

As a result of the Law of December 16, 2015, the mandatory automatic exchange of information applies
in Belgium (i) as of income year 2016 (first information exchange in 2017) towards the EU Member
States (including Austria, irrespective the fact that the automatic exchange of information by Austria
towards other EU Member States is only foreseen as of income year 2017), (ii) as of income year 2014
(first information exchange in 2016) towards the US and (iii) with respect to any other non-EU States that
have signed the MCAA, as of the respective date to be further determined by Royal Decree. In a Royal
Decree of June 14, 2017, as amended, it has been determined that the automatic provision of information
must be provided as from 2017 (for financial year 2016) for a first list of 18 jurisdictions, as from 2018 (for
financial year 2017) for a second list of 44 jurisdictions, as from 2019 (for financial year 2018) for 1 other
jurisdiction and as from 2020 (for financial year 2019) for a fourth list of 6 jurisdictions.

Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.

**Financial Transaction Tax**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive (the “Draft
**Directive”) for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,**
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia, within the framework of an enhanced cooperation procedure. In
December 2015, Estonia withdrew from the group of states willing to introduce the FTT (the
“Participating Member States”).

Pursuant to the Draft Directive, the FTT shall be payable on financial transactions provided at least one
party to the financial transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member State


-----

and there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State
which is a party to the financial transaction, or is acting in the name of a party to the transaction. The FTT
shall, however, not apply to (inter alia) primary market transactions referred to in Article 5 (c) of Regulation
(EC) No 1287/2006, including the activity of underwriting and subsequent allocation of financial
instruments in the framework of their issue.

In 2019, Finance Ministers of the States participating in the enhanced cooperation indicated that they
were discussing a new FTT proposal based on the French model of the tax and the possible mutualization
of the tax as a contribution to the EU budget.

According to the latest draft of this new FTT proposal (submitted by the German government), the FTT
would be levied at a rate of at least 0.2% of the consideration for the acquisition of ownership of shares
(including ordinary and any preference shares) admitted to trading on a trading venue or a similar third
country venue, or of other securities equivalent to such shares (“Financial Instruments”) or similar
transactions (e.g. an acquisition of Financial Instruments by means of an exchange of Financial
Instruments or by means of a physical settlement of a derivative). Only transactions with Financial
Instruments that have been issued by a company, partnership or other entity whose registered office is
established within one of the Participating Member States and with a market capitalization of at least
EUR 1 billion on December 1 of the year preceding the respective transaction should be covered. The
FTT shall be payable to the Participating Member State in whose territory the issuer of a Financial
Instrument has established its registered office. Based on the latest draft of the new FTT proposal, the
FTT should in principle not apply to straight bonds. Like the Draft Directive, the latest draft of the new FTT
proposal also stipulates that once the FTT enters into force, the Participating Member States shall not
maintain or introduce taxes on financial transactions other than the FTT (or VAT as provided in the
Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value added tax).

The FTT proposal is still subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and therefore
may be changed at any time. Moreover, once the FTT proposal has been adopted (the “FTT Directive”),
it will need to be implemented into the respective domestic laws of the Participating Member States and
the domestic provisions implementing the FTT Directive might deviate from the FTT Directive itself.

Prospective holders of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of
the FTT associated with subscribing for, purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN**
**INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in some of the_
_jurisdictions in which the Issuer and Guarantors are incorporated, and a summary of certain limitations_
_on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees. The descriptions below are only a summary and do_
_not purport to be complete or to discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect the enforceability_
_of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could_
_potentially apply in respect of certain matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes_
_over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to_
_enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes or the Guarantees. Prospective investors_
_in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to all such limitations and considerations._

_In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict_
_with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced,_
_or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the_
_obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the_
_jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different_
_from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially_
_involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another._

**European Union**

**_EU Insolvency Regulation_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the European
Union.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6,
2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) entered into force on June 26, 2017 and is applicable to
insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date, replacing Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000
on insolvency proceedings (which continues to apply to insolvency proceedings opened prior to June 26,
2017).

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public
collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts
of the Member State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of
the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings
relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its centre of main interests is a question
of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings
is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such
decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests, or “COMI” of a
“debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis
and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable
presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the
absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal
person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request
for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this
presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its
registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and
the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency
regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar
terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI,
including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority
of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are


-----

established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency
Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although
secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence
secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in
the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the
three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried
out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets”.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI,
any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an
establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted
to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings
in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to
Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced
in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings
cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member
State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor
whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the
territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a
public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the
establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori
_concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts
of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in
accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency
proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

As a general comment, in the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the
Guarantors’ subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it would not be possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome
of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the
security of the Issuers and the Guarantors.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation
shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable
or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change
from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at
the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

   - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds
of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

   - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the
claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

   - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use
of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

   - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as
no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to
commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers
conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of
the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been
taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member
State where the debtor has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member
State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or
of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights
that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in
such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested
to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking
adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding
three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a
request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to
three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

  - for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the
coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same
debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and
courts;

   - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient
administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same
group;

  - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

  - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of
such insolvency registers.

**_United Kingdom exit from European Union_**

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (GMT) (“exit
**day”) and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union**
(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 and as further amended from time to time) provides, among other
things, that, on and from December 31, 2020 at 11.00 p.m. (GMT):

  - the European Communities Act 1972 (the “ECA”), the legal basis for EU law having effect and
supremacy in English law, was repealed such that EU law no longer applies in the UK;


-----

  - unless otherwise amended or repealed by a Brexit SI (defined below), EU law, as it stood at the
end of the transition period, was converted into domestic law and laws that were made in the UK
in order to implement EU obligations were preserved; and

   - various pieces of secondary legislation in the form of statutory instruments (the “Brexit SIs”),
made by government ministers to correct deficiencies in legislation that would otherwise no longer
operate appropriately once the UK left the EU and to deal with areas of law where there was
effectively no new reciprocal agreement between the EU and the UK, came into effect.

However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom
after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments pursuant to Brexit
SIs. With regards to cross-border insolvency, one such Brexit SI was The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU
Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended from time to time) which sets out a number of
amendments to be made to the EU Insolvency Regulation, as it applies in the United Kingdom after the
end of the transition period. On December 24, 2020, three main future relationship agreements were
provisionally agreed between the UK and the EU including a trade and cooperation agreement (“TCA”).
To implement the TCA into English law (including by amending the EUWA, as required), the European
Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020 (“FRA”) was passed on December 30, 2020 and came into effect
on January 1, 2021. The European Parliament passed a resolution giving consent to the conclusion of
the TCA on April 27, 2021, which was followed by the European Council’s adoption of a decision to
conclude the TCA on April 29, 2021. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and
regulatory uncertainty throughout the region as to the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect
business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise
impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and
elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the
United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the EUWA, TCA or FRA do not include a replacement
for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the
absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal
with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules
in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing
the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in
reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be
recognition in the relevant EU member state.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”)
was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for
preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for
entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address
financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the
viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a
framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount


-----

of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the
Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new and interim financing and other
restructuring related transactions and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted
in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 1, 2024
or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition period for
Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by a company which is incorporated under the laws of, and has its statutory
seat (statutaire zetel/siège social) in, Belgium (the “Belgian Guarantor”). In the event of an insolvency of
the Belgian Guarantor, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium, provided Belgium is the
territory in which the center of the Belgian Guarantor’s main interest is situated. Such proceedings would
then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows secondary
bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose center of main
interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the
assets situated in Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two primary insolvency procedures: a judicial reorganization
procedure (gerechtelijke _reorganisatie/réorganisation_ _judiciaire)_ and a bankruptcy procedure
(faillissement/faillite). Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of
enterprises” of the Belgian Code of Economic Law. Note that, in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation
in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/ liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceeding will not be further discussed.

_Judicial reorganization._

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may
file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or
in the future. The interpretation of this principle is broad and defined by the courts. The fact that the
conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the obligation to file for bankruptcy
pursuant to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying
for a judicial reorganization. If the net assets of the debtor have fallen below 50% of the debtor’s
registered capital, the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk.

The petition for judicial reorganization, to be filed with the clerk office of the relevant Enterprise Court,
must include the contemplated measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to carry
out the reorganization. Further, the petition must be accompanied by a number of documents, including,
but not limited to, an interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an
auditor, an external expert accountant or a certified tax accountant.

As from the filing of the petition with the relevant Enterprise Court overseeing the judicial reorganization
and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot
be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by
court order. In addition, during this period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision,
subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a
result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such
assets. If the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceeding less than six months
ago and such request was accommodated, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect,
except if the court decides otherwise.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing
of the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for


-----

reorganization and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After such hearing, the court will rule
within eight days on the petition for judicial reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization
appear to be met, and all required documents have been provided, the court will declare the judicial
reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months.
At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial administrator in case of a procedure of transfer under
judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can
thereafter be extended by an additional period of up to six months. In exceptional circumstances (such as
due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment),
and if the interests of the creditors so allow, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium
period for six months.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures
with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the
debtor’s assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited
exceptions. Furthermore, during the moratorium, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by
court order. During the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to be granted legal or contractual security.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have
a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of
moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be
continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the
receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The
holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the
initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium.

A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15,
2004, as amended from time to time (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the
Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the
moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the
enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are
met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the
enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to
certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also
does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium to the extent
such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. However, in respect of an enforcement
over pledged cash falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act, the enforcement
prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a payment default), if the judicial
reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the
meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is
not such an entity.

During the judicial reorganization procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor in
principle continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the
court. However, upon request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed
useful for reaching the aims of the reorganization, the court may appoint, an enterprise mediator
(ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to assist the debtor during the moratorium and to
facilitate the reorganization of all or part of its assets or its activities. The court may also appoint a judicial
administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon the request of the debtor, any interested
party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings (kennelijk grove
_tekortkomingen/ manquements graves et caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies_
threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such
measure can preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to
replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the
event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et caractérisée), the court may,
upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, appoint a temporary administrator
(voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor’s corporate bodies for the
duration of the moratorium and charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request


-----

of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part
of the management of all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent
indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende aanwijzigingen/indices graves,
_précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._

The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the
reorganization, has additional powers, including the power to request the court to end the reorganization
procedure prematurely if he or she considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the
continuity of the whole or part of his or her business.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts.
Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the
initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest,
may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few
exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a
corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity within the meaning of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor is not such an entity. Book XX
of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis
of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such
default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract
during the reorganization procedure, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor, and the decision is
necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or
part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right does however not prevent the creditor from
suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the
agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable
settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the
transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and
may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. The Law of 26 March 2021 has
(temporarily) introduced an additional type of reorganization, namely the pre-packaged insolvency
procedure.

Amicable Settlement

In the case of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, the
debtor can draw up an agreement and joint payment scheme plan with at least two creditors in order to
settle its debts. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment
obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Only the
parties to the amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. If an agreement is
reached for reorganization purposes, it is submitted to the court and entered into a register. Such an
amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to certain
exceptions.

Collective Agreement

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan
during the reorganization procedure.

The debtor must prepare a reorganization plan in which it includes a list of its creditors and of the amount
of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding
security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party
that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by
the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary
basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction
in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time
frame. In addition, the court can, at any time, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of
the debtor or the creditor, change the amount and the ranking of the claim initially declared by the debtor
on the basis of new elements at the latest fifteen days before the date on which the creditors will vote on


-----

the reorganization plan. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least
one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization
plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the
reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court-appointed administrator or enterprise mediator, as the case may be. The plan
may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the
conversion of debt into equity (Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law contains certain
limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated
treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The maximum duration of the plan is five years. The
reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations
(www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The
court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a
double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in principal amount due) and ratified by the court
will bind the debtor and all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether
secured or not. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific
assets, pledgees, mortgagees and the so-called creditor-owners, provided that (i) interest is paid on the
principal amount of their outstanding debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than
24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court. Subject to certain conditions,
this period of 24 months may be extended by another twelve months. No other measures can be imposed
on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of
the judicial reorganization proceeding were not met or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public
policy.

Transfer of (part of) the activities

A court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or
by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court
can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The price of the transferred assets should at least be
equal to the liquidation value. In the case of comparable offers, priority will be given to the offer
guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement.

A court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators (gerechtsmandataris/
_mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be_
limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions.

In the case of a court-ordered transfer, co-contractors of ongoing agreements can be forced to continue
to perform the agreement without their consent after the transfer (except in case of intuitu personae
agreements), provided historical debts under such agreement are paid.

_Pre-packaged insolvency procedure_

On March 26, 2021, an amendment to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law entered into
effect. The amendment was initially set to automatically expire on June 30, 2021 but was extended by
Royal Decree until July 16, 2022. The amendment introduced a “pre-packaged insolvency procedure” in
Belgium, allowing the debtor to confidentially test the possibility of a court assisted amicable arrangement
or a collective agreement with creditors, outside the scope of formal judicial reorganization proceedings.
During the negotiation phase, only a limited moratorium may be put in place which may not exceed
four months and by means of which the court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment
terms and enforcement measures for certain creditors may be suspended. If the negotiations are
successful, the pre-pack proceedings may be transformed into formal judicial reorganization proceedings
to have the amicable arrangement sanctioned or the collective agreement put to vote on an expedited
timetable.

_Bankruptcy_

The Belgian bankruptcy procedure is essentially governed by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic
Law and by case law.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the
public prosecutor’s office, or the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets or the liquidator of “main


-----

insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (aangifte van faillissement/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor
must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be
unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments
is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must
be persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that a debtor has more debts than assets does not
mean that the bankruptcy conditions are met. Companies in liquidation can be declared bankrupt up to
six months after the judgments of the closing of the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority
and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver
(curator/ curateur) becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the
debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The
rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by
bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may decide not to continue the
performance of one or several contracts, subject to certain limitations, according to case law. The
counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within
fifteen days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not
make any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day
term. If the bankruptcy receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if an
ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen-day term, the counterparty to the
contract may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy, in which case such claim will rank pari passu
with the claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract
dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy
receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the
creditors. Two exceptions apply, however:

(a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and

(b) intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty constitutes
an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the
company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the
court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver
may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a
pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension
would normally be limited to the period required for the first report of verification of the claims. At the
request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year as from the
bankruptcy judgment, provided that such extension is in the interest of the bankruptcy estate and if the
further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets which does not prejudice the secured creditors,
and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.
However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the
suspension period.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do
so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of the mortgagee. However, a
first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as
the first report of claims has been finalized. The court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not


-----

more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the
assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to
be heard by the court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time insolvency
proceedings are initiated, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the initiation of such
insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on
its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts.

The ranking of different types of debt of the bankrupt debtor is determined on the basis of a complex set
of rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles:

(a) Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the
bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts”, have a senior priority. In addition, if the
bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such
costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets
before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and social security claims incurred
during the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential debts of the estate in a
subsequent liquidation or bankruptcy.

(b) Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured
asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization);

(c) Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims,
claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on
all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over security interests;

(d) Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of
security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will
be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu
(unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated); and

(e) Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of
distributions (such as income generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from
the bankruptcy estate if their relevant cause dates from after the bankruptcy.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by the Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantors’ legal and corporate object and must serve the own corporate
benefit of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate
benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal
authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or
collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is
only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the
prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that
the relevant Belgian company would derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream
or cross stream guarantees and collateral.

It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for
the relevant Belgian company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee
concerned. The financial support granted by a Belgian company should not exceed its financial
capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the
individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board
of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justifications by the Belgian companies’


-----

boards of directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations,
however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the relevant company may be held liable
(i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort.
Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances,
the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the
guarantee. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the
corporate benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount.
These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct
or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.
Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the
Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor will be so limited. Including such limitation language is, however, not
conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

The Indenture will expressly provide, substantially to the effect, that the aggregate amount guaranteed
by the Belgian Guarantor for the obligations under the Notes shall not include any liability which would
constitute illegal financial assistance pursuant to Article 5:152 of the Belgian Companies and
Associations Code or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by the Belgian
courts, and shall be limited to a maximum amount equal to the greater of:

(a) an amount equal to 85 per cent. of the Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as determined in
accordance with the Belgian Companies and Associations Code to determine whether a
dividend can be distributed and the Accounting Principles) as calculated on the basis of its most
recent audited Annual Financial Statements at the time the relevant demand is made;

(b) an amount equal to 85 per cent. of the Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as determined in
accordance with the Belgian Companies and Associations Code to determine whether a
dividend can be distributed and the Accounting Principles) as calculated on the basis of its most
recent audited Annual Financial Statements at the Issue Date; and

(c) the outstanding amount of any intra-group loans, advances or facilities made to the Belgian
Guarantor by any other member of the Group directly or indirectly using all or part of the
proceeds under the Notes (whether or not such intra-group loan is retained by the Belgian
Guarantor for its own purposes or on-lent) at the time the relevant demand is made.

Any payment made by the Belgian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall reduce the Belgian Guarantor’s
obligations, if any, vis-à-vis the Issuer in due proportion.

Whereby:

“Accounting Principles” means generally accepted accounting principles and practices in the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Belgian Guarantor (if applicable with respect to any other financial statements);
and

“Annual Financial Statements” means the audited financial statements for a financial year of the Belgian
Guarantor.

**_Beneficial Ownership_**

As there is no concept of “beneficial ownership” or “beneficial owner” under the present Belgian legal
system, the rights, claims and effects resulting from such a concept may not be enforceable under Belgian
law.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, certain business transactions that have
been concluded or performed by the debtor during the “hardening period” may be declared ineffective
against third parties.


-----

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed
to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may
determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an
earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order,
except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than
six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration
of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which will be declared ineffective
against third parties and which are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others,
(i) gratuitous transactions or transactions where the consideration received is considerably below the
value of the act or asset provided by the debtor, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments
other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) new security provided for pre-existing debt (save for any security
granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings).

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the
consideration received is considerably below the value of the guarantee or security interests provided,
(ii) the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the company’s cessation of
payments or (iii) it is granted for preexisting debts.

If the Guarantee granted by the Belgian Guarantor is successfully voided (based on the considerations
above), holders of the relevant Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of such Guarantee or
security interest and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such
Guarantee.

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Enterprise Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor
may obtain a court ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if
it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to
adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana), irrespective of its date.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition enforcement rights may, like those of any other creditor, be subject to Article 1244 of the
Belgian Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of these articles, Belgian courts may, in any civil proceeding involving a debtor,
defer or otherwise reasonably reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations. Belgian courts can
also decide that the interest rate applicable be reduced if it is considered to exceed the normal rate
applicable to similar debts.

**_Recognition and enforcement_**

The granting of a guarantee may be subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of
any of such conditions may render such guarantee invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of a
guarantee may be subject to formalities (e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming
in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts
may condition the enforcement of a guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and
undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the guarantee. Enforcement of guarantees may be
hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy
provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch
of the English documents which they may review.

**Czech Republic**

**_Limitation on and consideration for Czech Guarantor’s Guarantees_**

Czech law sets out certain limitations for a Czech company to guarantee the indebtedness of another
entity, in particular general insolvency limitations.


-----

In order to enable the Czech Guarantor to grant a guarantee and/or indemnity with a mitigated risk of
violating Czech law, it is standard market practice for indentures and guarantees provided by Czech
companies to contain a limitation language. Pursuant to the Indenture, the obligations and liabilities of
the Czech Guarantor under the Guarantee and/or indemnity provided in respect of the Notes may not
exceed a certain maximum cap, calculated by reference to the book value of all assets of the Czech
Guarantor so as to mitigate the risk that the Czech Guarantor becomes insolvent by being over-indebted
as a result of payment under its Guarantee in respect of the Notes. While this cap should generally
protect the Czech Guarantor from insolvency resulting from its over-indebtedness (i.e., balance sheet
insolvency), it cannot fully protect the Czech Guarantor from insolvency resulting from a lack of liquidity
in the case the Guarantee is called and the Czech Guarantor is unable to fulfill its obligations under the
Guarantee in accordance with its terms.

Accordingly, as a result of the above limitation language, if you were to enforce the Guarantee provided
by the Czech Guarantor, your claims are likely to be limited.

In general, any granting of a guarantee or a third-party security by a Czech guarantor that constitutes a
breach of the financial assistance rules may not be enforceable.

Further, with the effect from January 1, 2021, Czech law prohibits business corporations from providing
performance at no consideration to their shareholders as well as to their related persons. There are
different interpretations as to whether this may relate to security of any kind, including guarantees,
provided by subsidiaries to its direct or indirect parent. However, no market practice exists with regard to
this at the moment and it has not yet been confirmed by any binding judicial decisions.

**_Syndicated lending, Agency, Trustee_**

The Czech Civil Code introduced as of January 1, 2014 the concept of trust fund (svěřenský fond) into
Czech law. However, the concept of trust fund introduced under the Czech Civil Code is markedly different
from the New York law concept of trust. Therefore, the New York law concept of trust as contemplated
under the Indenture does not exist under Czech law and remains relatively untested in the Czech
Republic. The Czech Republic is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to
Trusts and on their Recognition which provides for the recognition of trusts and claims by trustees.
Although Section 73(4) of the International Law Act contains a rule pursuant to which a trust established
abroad could be recognized under Czech law, it requires that such a trust must have the same basic
features of a trust fund established under Czech law. In light of differences between the concept of trust
fund in Czech law and the New York law concept of trust, the New York law concept of trust as
contemplated under the Indenture would very likely not fall within the scope of Section 73(4) of the
International Law Act and could therefore not be recognized solely on the basis of the said section of the
International Law Act. Hence, there is still some risk that Czech authorities would not (based on Czech
procedural rules) recognize the Trustee and the trust as contemplated under the Indenture and that a
Czech court would not recognize enforcement proceedings undertaken by the Trustee on behalf of the
holders or beneficial holders. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the Trustee will have an
enforceable claim against the Guarantor in Czech courts.

**_Insolvency limitations (hardening periods and voidable acts)_**

If insolvency proceedings with respect to a Czech Guarantor are opened in the Czech Republic, any
Notes Guarantee provided by a Czech Guarantor could be subject to potential challenges by an
insolvency administrator (insolvenční správce) under the voidable (i.e. capable of being declared
ineffective as between the borrower and the relevant creditor) act principles, as set out in the Czech
insolvency law.

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge a Czech Guarantor’s transactions that
are deemed detrimental to the insolvent Czech Guarantor’s creditors and have been effected prior to the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings. These transactions may include the payment of any
amounts to the holders of the Notes, as well as the provision of any guarantee or any security interest in
favor of the holders of the Notes. An insolvency administrator’s right to challenge the transactions may,
depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions that have occurred up to five years prior to the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings. If the relevant transaction is successfully challenged, the
holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received to the insolvency
estate. Please see further details in the Czech insolvency section below.


-----

Pursuant to Czech civil law, it is also possible to challenge under certain circumstances the particular
transactions entered into or payments made by a debtor (Czech insolvency law has analogical rules—
see below the subsection “Insolvency Proceedings”, see also the specific regulations as regards
guarantees). A creditor may challenge as ineffective a debtor’s transaction with a third party if that
transaction occurred: (i) within the last five years if the debtor intended to prejudice a creditor by that
transaction and the relevant third party have known about that debtor’s intent, (ii) within the last two years
if the debtor prejudiced a creditor by that transaction and the relevant third party must have known about
that debtor’s intent (iii) within the last two years if the debtor prejudiced a creditor by that transaction and
that transaction was made between the debtor and its related person and/or in favor of a related person,
except when the related person at the time could not or must not have known about the debtor’s intent to
prejudice a creditor or (iv) within the last year in case of a purchase agreement or an exchange agreement
if the relevant third party must have known about the debtor’s intent to dissipate his assets, or (v) within
the last two years in case of gratuitous transactions, with exception of, for instance, a performance
imposed by a legal regulation or an usual occasional gift. The aforementioned applies similarly to an
omission by the debtor which resulted in loss of the debtor’s property right or creating, maintaining or
securing of a third party’s property right to the debtor’s assets. If a creditor’s challenge is successful, a
Czech court has the power, among other things, to declare the respective transaction ineffective vis-a-vis
the respective creditor and that creditor may request that its receivable will be settled against the debtor’s
property which was transferred under that challenged transaction. If a creditor cannot be satisfied in that
manner, the creditor may claim compensation against the person who benefited from that challenged
transaction.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

If a guarantor organized under the laws of the Czech Republic becomes bankrupt, holders of the Notes
may be limited in their ability to enforce their rights under the Notes, since the claims under the guarantee
are not secured; therefore, holders of the Notes would be considered as “unsecured creditors” within the
insolvency proceedings. The secured creditors (whose receivables are secured by a pledge or another
right attached to an item that constitutes the debtor’s assets) retain a right of preferred satisfaction with
regard to the disposal proceeds from the asset over which their security was established (for details see
below the subsection “Rights of the Creditors”).

Insolvency in the Czech Republic is regulated by Act No. 182/2006 Coll. on insolvency and methods of its
resolution, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”) and is also governed by European Insolvency
Regulations. Insolvency proceedings are generally applicable to all persons or entities.

Pursuant to the Insolvency Act, a debtor shall be deemed bankrupt (v úpadku) if it is either insolvent
(platební neschopnost) or over-indebted (předlužení).

A debtor is insolvent if all of the following assumptions are fulfilled: it (a) has several creditors (i.e., at
least two); (b) has monetary obligations overdue for more than 30 days; and (c) is unable to satisfy such
obligations. The debtor is deemed unable to satisfy its monetary obligations in the event that: (i) it has
stopped making payments of a substantial part of its monetary obligations; (ii) it has not paid such
obligations for a period of more than three months following their maturity; (iii) it is not possible to satisfy
any of the overdue monetary receivables towards the debtor through enforcement or execution; or (iv) it
fails to submit to the insolvency court lists of its property, obligations and employees (in cases where
such lists shall be submitted by the debtor to the insolvency court pursuant to the Insolvency Act). On the
other hand, it is presumed that the debtor who is a business person (an individual debtor who is carrying
on business activities for profit (a “business person”) and keeps accounting books) is able to meet its
obligations if (i) the difference between its due monetary obligations and its available cash is less than
10% of its due monetary obligations, or (ii) a cash liquidity forecast prepared and certified by an external
expert proves that such difference is to drop below 10% of debtor’s due monetary obligations in the
following 8 – 12 weeks.

A debtor (a business person only) is over-indebted if it has at least two creditors and the sum of its
liabilities exceeds the value of its property. When estimating the value of the debtor’s property, the further
management of its property or the further operation of its business is also taken into account, provided
that given all the circumstances it may be reasonably assumed that the debtor will be able to continue
with managing its property or operating its business. In the case of over-indebtedness, all of the debtor’s
debts are taken into account, irrespective of whether they are already due or not.


-----

The Insolvency Act also governs so-called “impending insolvency”, which means a case when it is justified
to assume, in the light of all relevant circumstances, that the debtor will be unable to satisfy a substantial
part of its monetary obligations in a due and timely manner.

There are three ways to solve the debtor’s insolvency: (a) bankruptcy proceedings; (b) reorganization; or
(c) debt clearance (the last option is only for a legal entity that is not deemed to be a business person
under law and at the same time does not have any debts from a business activity, or a natural person who
does not have any debts from a business activity). Reorganization, as a manner for resolving the debtor’s
insolvency, is permissible only for a debtor (a business person) with a net turnover of CZK 50,000,000 in
the last accounting period, or with at least 50 employees. With the creditors’ consent, however,
reorganization is also available to smaller debtors, subject to further procedural conditions.
Reorganization may not be used, inter alia, by companies in liquidation.

Since only few debtors fulfill these criteria for reorganization, the most common way of resolving the
debtor’s insolvency in the Czech Republic is bankruptcy proceedings.

The creditors’ meeting may pass a resolution on the method of resolving the insolvency (i.e. either
reorganization or bankruptcy liquidation) of an insolvent debtor. Such a resolution, however, needs to be
passed by a quorum of either half of all secured creditors in attendance and half of all unsecured
creditors in attendance, or by 90% of all creditors in attendance, based on the value of their respective
claims. If such a resolution regarding the method for resolving the insolvency is passed, it is then
confirmed by the insolvency court.

The creditors’ meeting will have to constitute a creditors’ committee (věřitelský výbor). A creditors’
committee may have from 3 to 7 members (as may be decided by the creditors’ meeting) and has a
primarily organizational and supervisory role. The number of members of the creditors’ committee
nominated by the unsecured creditors must be at least as high as the number of members nominated by
the secured creditors. Where the number of creditors with submitted claims does not exceed 50, the
creditors’ meeting can appoint a representative of the creditors (zástupce věřitelů) whose function is
identical to that of a creditors’ committee.

Unless the insolvency court approves the reorganization as the method for resolving the insolvency in the
same decision in which it declares the insolvency of a debtor, the court has to make the decision on the
method of resolving insolvency no later than 3 months after the decision on insolvency has been issued.
There is also a special case of so called pre-packaged reorganization. If the creditors’ meeting passes a
resolution on the method of resolving the debtor’s insolvency, such resolution of the creditors’ meeting is
binding on the insolvency court.

All information on insolvency proceedings in the Czech Republic is publicly accessible in the Insolvency
Register maintained in an electronic form by the Ministry of Justice.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy is the most frequent method of dealing with a debtor’s insolvency and in most cases
effectively leads to termination of the debtor’s business. On the other hand, a declaration of bankruptcy
need not necessarily result in the termination of the debtor’s operations, as the insolvency trustee
becomes responsible for running the debtor’s enterprise and may, if the insolvency trustee considers this
appropriate and economically viable, continue in operating the business of the insolvent debtor (provided
that there is an economic reason and benefits for the creditors) with a view of selling the business as a
going concern. The general purpose of bankruptcy is the proportionate satisfaction of creditors from the
sale of debtor’s assets forming the insolvency estate (majetková podstata) (the “insolvency estate”).
Upon declaration of the bankruptcy, claims not yet due become due and payable and court, administrative
or other proceedings concerning the insolvency estate involving the debtor are suspended, unless the
Insolvency Act stipulates otherwise. The Insolvency Act further provides for specific provisions concerning
the termination of particular types of agreements as a result of the declaration of bankruptcy. With
respect to executory contracts (agreements containing unperformed acts of either the debtor or the
contracting party at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy), the insolvency trustee shall be entitled to
perform such agreement on behalf of the debtor or it may reject such agreements. In a bankruptcy the
debtor’s assets are realized (sold) at a (public or judicial) auction or outside an auction (i.e. direct sale)
and the proceeds of such realization are distributed among debtor’s creditors in accordance with the
Insolvency Act.


-----

**_Reorganization_**

The general purpose of reorganization is the preservation of the debtor’s business as a going concern
while it restructures its capital structure. A reorganization is only available to a debtor—business person
(whether a legal entity or a natural person) and with respect to debtors with at least 50 employees or a
total turnover of at least CZK 50 million (approx. EUR 1.9 million) for the accounting period immediately
preceding the filing of the insolvency petition. With the creditor’s consent, however, reorganization is also
available to smaller debtors, subject to further procedural conditions. The reorganization may be proposed
by either the debtor or a creditor within time limits set out by the Insolvency Act. Other debtors not
meeting these criteria may enter into reorganization only if they submit a plan pre-approved by the
majority of secured and unsecured creditors within 15 days after the decision on declaration of insolvency
(pre-packaged reorganization). Certain types of debtors may not reorganize at all.

A court will authorize a reorganization proceeding upon an application made in good faith by the debtor
or, subject to a creditors’ meeting approval, by a creditor. The debtor’s management then has an
exclusivity period of 120 days (which the court may extend by up to another 120 days) to submit a
proposal of a reorganization plan, unless the creditors’ meeting decides otherwise, in which case a
creditor may do so. The reorganization plan with a disclosure report is, subject to the court’s approval of
the report, then submitted to a vote by the creditors. The content of the plan is not limited by the law—it
can set forth any lawful measures.

In reorganization, the debtor remains in possession, subject to monitoring by the trustee who exercises
certain administrative functions, and the creditors’ committee. The trustee can also exercise all voting
rights of the shareholders except the right to elect the management, which remains elected by the
shareholders subject to creditors’ committee approval. In certain specific cases, the creditors’ committee
has a right to appoint the debtor’s statutory bodies, in particular when the creditors drive the
reorganization.

All details on reorganization, including handling of debtor’s indebtedness and corporate restructuring,
are included in the reorganization plan. The reorganization plan is subject to general approval of creditors
and shareholders voting in classes for the purposes of plan approval. The plan needs to comply with
statutory requirements, including the fair treatment of creditors and the retention or renewal of security
for secured creditors. Final approval on the restructuring plan lies with the insolvency court which can
approve the plan even if certain classes disagreed with the plan, provided that the statutory requirements
are met (cram-down). The resolution of the insolvency court may be subject to appeal.

A so-called pre-packaged reorganization is a condensed process derived from the reorganization as
described above. Under the given circumstances, pre-packaged reorganization would be based on the
premise that the entire process is pre-discussed among the relevant debtor and its creditors, and as a
result of such negotiation the reorganization plan would be prepared by such debtor (preferably with
assistance of its major creditors) prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. For the rest,
the principles of standard reorganization apply.

In a pre-packaged reorganization, the petition for insolvency is always filed by the relevant debtor and
has to include provisions indicating that the required method for resolving insolvency is reorganization. A
reorganization plan which has been approved by a majority of its secured creditors and a majority of its
unsecured creditors must be attached. The insolvency court then shall pass a decision on insolvency in
which it approves of reorganization being the method for resolving the insolvency. The creditors may
agree with the debtor and determine the insolvency trustee to be appointed by the court at the onset of
the proceedings.

**_Temporary measures relating to the COVID-19 crisis_**

The Covid legislation suspended the obligation of a debtor to file an insolvency petition immediately after
it becomes aware of its insolvency, or should have become aware of it by exercising due care.

Debtors whose insolvency occurred during the epidemic emergency measures, or was mostly caused by
the circumstances related to the epidemic emergency measures which made it impossible or difficult to
fulfil their financial obligations, are exempted from the obligation to file an insolvency petition until 30
June 2021.

Further, a so-called “extraordinary moratorium” was introduced and remains in force until June 30, 2021.
The application may be submitted prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after it


-----

has been initiated by a creditor. The Czech Insolvency Act prescribes several conditions for applicants,
such as (i) the debtor seeks the extraordinary moratorium due to the epidemic emergency measures;
(ii) the debtor was not insolvent as of October 5, 2020; (iii) within two months before March 12, 2020 or
after this date, the debtor neither paid out any extraordinary dividends to shareholders (affiliates), or
members of corporate bodies, nor otherwise distributed its own resources or provided any exceptional
performance to such parties. Once the extraordinary moratorium is declared, the debtor is entitled to pay
with priority the obligations related to maintaining its operations that occurred after declaration of the
extraordinary moratorium.

**_Commencement of the insolvency proceedings and its consequences_**

Insolvency proceedings are commenced upon an insolvency petition being delivered to the relevant
insolvency court. However, the effects of the commencement of insolvency proceedings are only invoked
upon the publication of the notice of the commencement of insolvency proceedings in the insolvency
register. The insolvency petition can be filed by the debtor or any creditor of the debtor. A debtor is
required under the Insolvency Act to file an insolvency petition after it learns or should have learned,
while acting with due care, of the debtor’s insolvency. Such obligation also applies to the statutory
representatives of the debtor, its statutory body or a liquidator of a legal entity. In the event that statutory
representatives of the debtor, its statutory body or its liquidator fail to follow their duty to file the insolvency
petition, they shall be liable for damages suffered by the creditors as a result of such failure. Only the
debtor may file the insolvency petition for an impending insolvency.

Furthermore, in case creditors intend to initiate an insolvency proceeding and file the insolvency petition,
the insolvency court must first conduct a preliminary assessment as to whether there exist “good grounds
to doubt the legitimacy” of such insolvency petition (i.e. whether the insolvency court could dismiss the
insolvency petition for being apparently groundless). This measure was enacted to serve as a protection
of potential debtors against frivolous or vexatious petitions filed by creditors. In general, insolvency
petitions are considered to be frivolous or vexatious if they, in fact, pursue a goal other than that of
resolving the debtor’s insolvency. According to Section 128a(2) of the Insolvency Act, an insolvency
petition is groundless, in particular, where: (i) the creditor proves its entitlement to file the insolvency
petition using a receivable which may not be considered for the purposes of a decision on insolvency
(ii) it is a repeat filing and the insolvency petitioner fails to prove that it has fulfilled obligations imposed on
it by a previous decision of the insolvency court, (iii) the creditor by filing the insolvency petition clearly
intends to abuse its rights to the debtor’s detriment, or (iv) the deposit for the costs of the insolvency
proceedings, which was payable simultaneously with filing the insolvency petition, was not paid in due
and timely manner. If the insolvency court concludes that there are, indeed, “good grounds to doubt the
legitimacy” of the insolvency petition submitted by creditors, it must decide no later than by the end of the
business day following the receipt of the insolvency petition that neither the insolvency petition nor other
underlying documentation will be published in the insolvency register. Following this decision, the
insolvency court has seven days to either (i) dismiss the insolvency petition as clearly groundless, or
(ii) to publish the notice of initiation of insolvency proceedings in the insolvency register (in case it,
ultimately, concludes that there are no grounds for dismissing the insolvency petition).

The insolvency court may appoint a preliminary insolvency trustee (and must do so if so requested by a
debtor in the motion for a moratorium or if the court issues a preliminary injunction). Unless such
preliminary insolvency trustee has specific powers granted by a court, a preliminary insolvency trustee
has only limited powers (i.e. compiling an inventory of the debtor’s assets and reviewing its accounting
books).

**_Effects of Opening Insolvency Proceedings_**

The commencement of the insolvency proceedings has the following key effects resulting in an immediate
stay on individual creditor action: (i) claims and other rights of the creditors may not be enforced through
an individual court action as long as such claims may be filed within the insolvency proceedings; (ii) any
enforcement or creation of security must be carried out under the conditions set out in the Insolvency Act;
and (iii) except in the case of enforcement of certain priority receivables towards the insolvency estate
(such as remuneration and costs of the insolvency administrator) and certain other priority receivables,
enforcement of a decision affecting the debtor’s assets may be ordered but may not be carried out.

Following the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor’s authority to dispose of its
assets will be very limited. The debtor may not perform any steps that would affect the structure, use or
determination of the assets in a substantial way. In fact, the debtor is entitled to dispose of its assets only


-----

in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business (i.e. thereby excluding major, risky and unusual
transactions). In addition to the immediate stay on creditor action, on the application of the debtor (with
the approval of the majority of creditors by value) the insolvency court may declare a moratorium over
the debtor. The insolvency court will set the period for the moratorium up to three months. This period can
be further extended by the insolvency court on the application of the debtor (with the approval of the
majority of creditors by value). If a moratorium is declared, the court may not, for the period of the
moratorium, declare the debtor insolvent and the contracts required for the continuation of the debtor’s
business are protected. Key suppliers may be paid and are restricted from terminating supply
agreements. Note that in practice such moratoria are rare and almost never successful.

If the insolvency court ascertains that the debtor is insolvent, the court will appoint an insolvency
administrator, who has a major impact on the course of the insolvency proceedings.

**_Court’s decision on insolvency and its consequences_**

The insolvency court must decide on the insolvency within 15 days from filing by a debtor, and it must
perform its first act in the insolvency proceedings within 10 days from the filing of the petition for insolvency
if filed by a creditor. The decision on insolvency in the latter case must be issued by the relevant insolvency
court without undue delay; practically, a contested creditor’s insolvency petition usually takes three to
six months to resolve, however, one cannot exclude the possibility that it may take substantially longer. In
its decision on insolvency, the insolvency court must, among other things, call upon the creditors to
submit their claims within a 2 months period. The decision must include a notice to debtors of the insolvent
debtor according to which any obligations towards the insolvent entity should be performed directly to the
insolvency trustee. Importantly, the decision must also contain a specific place and date for the creditor’s
meeting to take place.

The insolvency court will also appoint an insolvency trustee who holds the power to deal with the
insolvency estate to the extent that the debtor is prohibited by law or a decision of the insolvency court
from dealing with its estate. The insolvency trustee will also ascertain, examine, list and collect in the
debtor’s assets and scrutinize filed claims. The insolvency trustee’s remaining tasks will depend on
whether the debtor’s insolvency will be resolved by “bankruptcy” (konkurz) or “reorganization”
(reorganizace).

**_Rights of the Creditors in Insolvency Proceedings_**

After an insolvency petition has been filed and the insolvency court declares a debtor insolvent, its
creditors must register their claims within the period specified in the insolvency court’s decision, which
under the Insolvency Act is set forth for 2 months. Claims in a foreign currency shall be converted into
CZK at the official exchange rate issued by the Czech National Bank as of the date the commencement
of insolvency proceedings is published or as of the due date of the relevant claim if such claim matured
at an earlier date. Claims registered after the deadline has expired will not be satisfied in the insolvency
proceedings. Submission of a claim must be filed on a special form and complemented by all relevant
documentation specified within the form. The creditors may also file their claims which are future or
contingent claims. Contingent claims are claims whose maturity is dependent on the fulfillment of certain
documents.

Submitted claims can be contested as to their authenticity, amount and/or ranking. A debtor, the insolvency
trustee or any registered creditor can contest the submitted claims. As a defense against contesting
claims by insolvency trustee or a debtor, the contested creditor has to file an action with a court within
30 days after the verification of submitted claims is conducted by the insolvency trustee and seek
recognition of its claim.

The Insolvency Act recognizes a preferred group of creditors, the “secured creditors,” whose receivables
are secured by a right to assets belonging to the insolvency estate such as a pledge, a retention right, a
limitation of the right to transfer of real estate, a security transfer of a right or an assignment of a
receivable or another similar right pursuant to foreign law. The secured creditor’s claims rank after certain
administrative claims but, to the extent they are secured, in priority to the unsecured creditors. The
secured creditor may actually rank differently with respect to different portions of its secured claims. The
secured creditor’s claims shall be satisfied (up to the amount of the secured claim) from the gross
proceeds of sale of the relevant security asset, less the costs of sale of the relevant security asset, the
costs of maintenance and the insolvency administrator’s remuneration. The rest of the secured creditor’s
claim (if any) will be settled pari passu with unsecured creditors.


-----

In connection with filing of creditors’ claims it is important to note that the Insolvency Act sets out sanctions
for overvaluation of creditor’s claims. If, during the review process in the insolvency proceedings, it is
revealed that the actual amount of a filed claim is less than 50% of the amount of the filed claim, the
consequences for the creditor are as follows: (i) the filed claim will not be taken into consideration even to
the extent it is actually ascertained (unless the insolvency court’s decision on the amount of the filed
claim depended on an expert’s opinion or the court’s discretion); and (ii) the creditor may be ordered by
a court (upon the insolvency administrator’s motion) to pay in favor of the “insolvency estate” an amount
of up to the amount constituting the excess of the filed claim over the actual amount of the receivable. A
similar consequence will occur if it is ascertained that the secured creditor has the right to receive
satisfaction of a filed claim to the extent of less than 50% of the amount of the secured filed claim or that
such secured creditor has the right to receive satisfaction ranking lower than what was claimed in the
filing. In such instances: (i) the creditor’s right to that security shall not be taken into account (the secured
creditor becomes an unsecured creditor) (unless the insolvency court’s decision on the amount of the
filed claim depended on an expert’s opinion or the court’s discretion); and (ii) the court may order the
creditor to pay creditors who claim to receive payment on a secured basis over the same assets up to the
amount by which the amount of the secured claim in the filing exceeds the value of the secured claim as
determined in the insolvency proceedings.

**_Ineffectiveness of Legal Acts in Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Czech Insolvency Act, the ineffectiveness of the following legal acts of the debtor shall
be established by a decision of the insolvency court on an action filed by the insolvency administrator,
provided that the debtor has through such acts impaired the ability or reduced the sums available for the
satisfaction of its creditors or has favored certain creditors at the expense of others:

  - legal acts by which the debtor enters into transactions without receiving consideration
(bezúplatně), or for consideration substantially lower than the usual price for performing such a
transaction (the “Legal Acts at Undervalue”);

   - legal acts by which the debtor enters into transactions with the intention to curtail the satisfaction
of its creditor or creditors whilst such intention was or must have been known to that creditor or
creditors (the “Fraudulent Transfers”); and

   - legal acts which result in a creditor receiving greater consideration than it would otherwise have
received in the debtor’s bankruptcy, to the detriment of other creditors (the “Preferential Legal
**Acts”).**

It is upon the discretion of the insolvency administrator whether to file an action challenging such legal
actions of the debtor. The insolvency administrator is always required to do so upon the resolution of the
creditors’ committee.

The insolvency administrator may file an action against all such acts that were taken by the debtor in the
last three years preceding the commencement of the insolvency proceedings for the benefit of a person
forming a corporate group, i.e. being affiliated with the debtor, or within one year preceding the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings for the benefit of any third party. In general, the Insolvency
Act shifts the burden of proof in respect to certain matters on the insolvent debtor’s counterparty and
extends the clawback periods in case of legal acts made in favor of connected persons. In relation to the
Fraudulent Transfers, the period in each case is five years preceding the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings.

If the action of the insolvency administrator is successful, a person in whose favor a debtor’s performance
under ineffective legal acts was delivered or transferred must return such debtor’s performance to the
“insolvency estate”. Persons benefiting from such ineffective legal act are also subject to such obligation.

The Legal Act at Undervalue is defined by the Czech Insolvency Act as an act by which the debtor enters
into transactions without receiving consideration (bezúplatně), or for consideration substantially lower
than the usual price for performing such a transaction, provided that the act was performed by an insolvent
debtor or the act might have caused the debtor’s insolvency. The Legal Act at Undervalue undertaken by
the debtor for the benefit of a company in the same corporate group is deemed to be an act undertaken
by the debtor when insolvent and hence the burden is on the debtor to prove that it was not insolvent at
the time of the transaction or that the act was not made at an undervalue. Some acts, however, are not
considered as the Legal Acts at Undervalue, such as the performance of the debtor imposed by a legal
regulation, an occasional gift of reasonable value or legal acts from which the debtor reasonably expected


-----

to gain a reasonable profit, provided that such legal act was not performed for the benefit of a person
belonging to the same group of companies and that the person for whose benefit the act was undertaken
could not have discovered, acting diligently, that the debtor was insolvent or that the act might have
caused the debtor’s insolvency.

The Preferential Legal Act is defined by the Insolvency Act as an act on the basis of which any creditor
receives greater consideration than it would otherwise have received in the debtor’s bankruptcy, to the
detriment of other creditors, provided that the act was performed by an insolvent debtor or the act might
have caused the debtor’s insolvency. The Preferential Legal Act undertaken by the debtor for the benefit
of a company in the same corporate group is deemed to be an act undertaken by the debtor when
insolvent and hence the burden is on the debtor to prove that it was not insolvent at the time of the
transaction or that the act was not a preference. Preferential Legal Acts include acts by which the debtor:
(i) repaid a debt before maturity; (ii) agreed on an amendment or replacement of an obligation to its
detriment; (iii) waived or otherwise enabled the expiry or non-performance of its claim; or (iv) provided its
property as security for an existing obligation.

Fraudulent Transfers are acts by which the debtor intentionally curtailed the satisfaction of a creditor,
provided that such intent was or must have been known to the other party. When such legal act is taken
for the benefit of the person forming a corporate group with the debtor, the debtor’s intent shall be deemed
to have been known to the other party.

All legal acts taken by the debtor and an affiliated company within the relevant time frame (i.e. three years
preceding the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, or, in case of Fraudulent Transfers,
five years preceding the commencement of the insolvency proceedings) are generally closely examined
by the insolvency administrator and the creditors’ committee.

All most relevant information on insolvency proceedings in the Czech Republic is publicly accessible in
the Insolvency Register, maintained in electronic form by the Ministry of Justice.

Amendments to the Insolvency Act adopted in recent years aimed to strengthen the transparency of the
Czech insolvency proceedings. For instance, it prevents the insolvent debtors from forum shopping,
provides additional protection against creditors’ insolvency petitions, requires a creditor to disclose its
beneficial owners, if it acquired a claim against a debtor within 6 months prior to the commencement of,
or during insolvency proceedings, formally incorporated a possibility of creditors to file their claims which
represent future or contingent claims and introduced changes to voting rights within the assembly of
creditors, particularly prevents creditors forming a corporate group with the debtor to vote in all matters
except for a reorganization plan submitted by another person than a debtor or a creditor within that
corporate group.

**Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities/Enforcement of Notes Guarantee**

Although, technically speaking, the submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
would be recognized under Czech law, there is a serious risk, for reasons described below, that a
judgment given by the courts of New York would not be recognized or enforceable in the Czech Republic.
Especially, regardless of the parties’ submission to jurisdiction, all matters relating to the constitution and
to the existence of the Czech entities would always be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
Czech Republic. The Czech courts would also always have jurisdiction in respect of the insolvency of a
Czech entity and in respect of the enforcement of a claim in the Czech Republic. The recognition and
enforceability of a judgment obtained in New York would also be governed by Czech Act No. 91/2012
Coll., International Law Act (the “International Law Act”). There is a significant risk, based on Section 15
of the International Law Act, that a judgment handed down by a New York court would not be recognized
in the Czech Republic. Section 15(1)(f) states that a foreign judgment cannot be recognized or enforced
unless the reciprocal enforcement of judgements given by the Czech courts of the Czech Republic is
ensured in the relevant foreign country. The United States and the Czech Republic do not presently have
a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
in the Czech Republic (save for certain family matters), nor has the Czech Ministry of Justice declared
that reciprocity has been established with the United States in practice. Nevertheless, the Czech Ministry
of Justice may, subject to consultations with the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs (among others), declare
that reciprocity has been established with respect to a particular foreign country. However, even in such a
case, the declaration (of establishment of reciprocity) would be considered and treated only as an
evidence by Czech courts and other state authorities of the Czech Republic and, therefore, it would not
be automatically binding upon the courts. As stated, no such declaration of reciprocity has been issued


-----

by the Czech Ministry of Justice with respect to the United States. Therefore, judgments rendered by
federal or state courts in the United States are not currently generally recognized and enforceable in the
Czech Republic.

Even if the reciprocity of recognition and enforcement of U.S. and Czech court judgments is established
and/or declared in the future, judgment(s) obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not
predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, will not be recognized and enforced in Czech
courts pursuant to the provisions of International Law Act, as amended, if, among other things: (a) the
matter falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of Czech courts or if the respective U.S. court proceedings
could not have been carried out by any authority in the U.S., should the rules regulating the jurisdiction of
Czech courts be applied to assessing the jurisdiction of the U.S. authority, unless the participant(s) in the
proceedings against whom the judgement is given have voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of that
U.S. authority; (b) if proceedings are pending before a Czech court with regard to the very same legal
relation(s) and if such Czech proceedings commenced prior to the U.S. proceedings, in which the U.S.
judgement whose recognition has been proposed, was given; (c) if a Czech court has already issued a
judgement about the same legal relations and such a judgment has already come to legal force, or if the
judgement of the body of a third state which came to legal force has already been recognized in the
Czech Republic; (d) if a participant in the U.S. proceedings, with regard to whom the judgement is to be
recognized, has been deprived of the ability to duly participate in the U.S. proceedings by actions taken
or inaction adopted by the U.S. authority, including, without limitations, when the said participant has not
been served and delivered summons or the motion which seeks to commence such foreign proceedings;
or (e) any such recognition would be manifestly contrary to public order. Without prejudice to the
immediately foregoing conditions, the reciprocity would not be required if the U.S. judgement was not
aimed at a citizen of the Czech Republic or a Czech legal entity.

Nonetheless, investors have an option to commence proceedings directly in the Czech Republic in which
proceedings the judgment rendered by a U.S. court would serve as documentary evidence. However,
such proceedings could be very lengthy, since a Czech court first would have to ascertain the U.S.
securities law as the substantive law governing the subject matter of proceedings. Moreover, no
assurance could be given that a judgment of a Czech court would be identical to the one issued by a U.S.
court, as any such decision by a U.S. court would not binding on Czech courts.

Any person bringing an action in the Czech Republic may be required to: (i) submit to the court a
translation in the Czech language (apostilled if applicable pursuant to respective international treaties) of
any relevant document prepared by a sworn translator authorized by such court; and (ii) pay a court filing
fee.

With respect to service of documents in civil or commercial matters involving the Czech Guarantor and
brought to or pending before U.S. courts, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the Czech Republic upon the Czech Guarantor provided that The Hague Convention on the Service
Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of 15 November 1965 is
complied with.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in England (the “English Guarantor”) and, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture and the Notes, are obliged to guarantee the
Notes (the “English Guarantee”).

Therefore, any insolvency of an English Guarantor would likely be governed by English insolvency laws
and such insolvency proceedings would likely be commenced in England. However, insolvency
proceedings in relation to the English Guarantors could also be opened in a country other than England
and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in which those
insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. For example, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation,
where a company incorporated in England has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of
the EU, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in the member state in
which its COMI is located and be subject to the laws of that member state. In addition, the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
(subject to certain modifications) in Great Britain, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e. non-English)
proceedings may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where any English
company has its COMI (for the purposes of the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 which may
differ from “COMI” under the EU Insolvency Regulation) in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non-main


-----

proceedings where it has an “establishment” in such foreign jurisdiction (being a place of operations
where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services). Upon
recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an application to the
court for an order under or in connection with (among others) sections 238 (in relation to transactions at
undervalue), 239 (in relation to preferences), 244 (in relation to extortionate credit transactions) and 423
(in relation to transactions defrauding creditors) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”) (see
below at “Avoidance of transactions”). For such purpose, certain time periods and notice periods specified
in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or
the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in
the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Where such an application is made, then those sections
(together with ancillary sections of the Insolvency Act 1986 relating thereto) shall apply whether or not
the company is being wound-up or is in administration under UK insolvency law.

The English courts in some circumstances have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings not only in
respect of a debtor or guarantor that is incorporated in England and Wales (such as the English
Guarantors). The English courts may have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of a
foreign (i.e. non UK) entity in relation to specific insolvency proceedings (these are set out more fully
below, but by way of example, the English courts may have jurisdiction to place foreign companies into
compulsory liquidation as an unregistered company). Whether such proceedings would be recognized in
the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant foreign company will generally be a matter for the law of
that jurisdiction.

English insolvency law is different to the insolvency laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it
is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. English
insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of an English Guarantee against the
relevant English Guarantor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the English Guarantees. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors,
their ability to enforce their rights under the English Guarantees, and therefore may limit the amounts that
investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

A company can enter into administration if the company: (i) is registered under the Companies Act 2006
(“CA 2006”) in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) is incorporated in an EEA State; or (iii) is not
incorporated in an EEA State but has its COMI (for the purposes of the Insolvency Act) in an EU member
state (other than Denmark) or in the UK.

There are two methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by
a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain forms with the court
following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The in-court route is commenced
by an application to court by, amongst others, the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more
of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors and, where applicable, the Financial Conduct
Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court
method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying
floating charge (“QFC”) as defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act. In either
method, where any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment it will be
necessary to show (or in the case of the out of court route declare) that the company is, or is likely to
become, unable to pay its debts (pursuant to the principles set out under section 123 of the Insolvency
Act). Although the Insolvency Act doesn’t provide a formal test or definition of “insolvency”, section 123 of
the Insolvency Act states that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts as they fall due in a number
of circumstances: (i) if the company is deemed unable to pay its debts on a “cash flow” insolvency basis
(for example, it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due);
or (ii) if the company is deemed unable to pay its debts as they fall due on a “balance sheet” insolvency
basis by it being proved to the satisfaction of the court that that the value of the company’s assets is less
than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. So called
cash flow insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy or secure a
creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service. Regardless of how an
administrator is appointed, the administrator in his or her opinion, must be satisfied that one of the
following statutory objectives can be achieved (to be looked at successively): (1) rescuing the company


-----

as a going concern or, (2) if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation without first being in administration
or, (3) if neither of those objectives in (1) and (2) is reasonably practicable, realizing property to make a
distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any
distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”).

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the
appointment of administrators or on the making of an application to appoint an administrator or the filing
of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may
be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or
permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by
the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or
property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any
application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if an English Guarantor was to enter into administration, whilst the Trustee could make a
demand for payment in respect of the relevant English Guarantee without the permission of the court or
consent of the administrator, such English Guarantee could not be enforced by way of an institution or
continuation of legal process while the relevant English Guarantor was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure that the Trustee would obtain
such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide
powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose
of the property of a company in administration.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able
to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium.
This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium upon an administration in relation to a “security
financial collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares,
bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”).

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment,
an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of
all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. In addition, an administrator is
given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency
Act, dispose of the property and the assets of a company in administration. An administrator’s powers
further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against
the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Transactions at an
_undervalue”,_ “—Preference” “—Transactions _defrauding_ _creditors”_ and “—Extortionate _credit_
_transactions” below)._

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
the proceeds of which are distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority
prescribed by the Insolvency Act. See “—Priority on insolvency.” Once the liquidator has completed this
task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies. Liquidation proceedings
may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s
COMI is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s COMI is in an EU member state and there is an establishment in
the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation in respect of foreign companies as
unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales. The
circumstances in which an unregistered foreign company may be wound up by the English court are
generally more limited than for registered English companies under section 122 of the Insolvency Act.

There are two distinct forms of liquidation: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and
(b) voluntary liquidation which can be by way of either a members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) or a
creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”), commenced by resolution of the company’s members. The
difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a MVL, the
directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency within the following
12 months of the commencement of the winding up. The primary (albeit not exclusive) ground for the
compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in


-----

Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure initiated by the
presentation of a winding-up petition. Voluntary liquidations are initiated by the company out-of-court. A
CVL (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the
creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. An MVL is a solvent
voluntary liquidation that is controlled by the members.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court,
it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a
winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No
legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As
a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the
case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to
apply for a stay. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead and enforce their
security.

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation.
This includes, without limitation, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company,
to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the
company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company, disclaim onerous property or
contracts in accordance with section 178 of the Insolvency Act, bring actions against the directors or
former directors and to challenge antecedent transactions. see “—Avoidance of Transactions”.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the
company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. A
liquidator or administrator will need to comply with a set statutory order of priority when he or she
distributes the proceeds of realized assets to a company’s creditors.

Creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent
company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the
Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until
the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to
the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration
are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the
mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each
party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable
by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor)
or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of
the debtor but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the
assets in which they have a proprietary interest;

Second ranking claims (where insolvency proceedings of a company are begun within 12 weeks following
the end of any moratorium under the new stand-alone moratorium; see “Corporate Insolvency and
_Governance Act 2020—Moratorium” below): any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver,_
moratorium debts, and pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday
during the moratorium; Third ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory
provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid);


-----

Fourth ranking claims: ordinary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not
limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state
pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the
insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose
contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As
between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally;

Fifth ranking claims: secondary preferential creditors. Secondary preferential debts are currently limited
to certain categories of bank account deposits. Under the Finance Bill 2020 and the Insolvency Act 1986
(HMRC Debts: Priority on Insolvency) Regulations 2020, from December 1, 2020, secondary preferential
debts include claims owing to HMRC in respect of VAT, PAYE income tax, employee national insurance
contributions, student loan repayments and construction industry scheme deductions. As between one
another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

Sixth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This
would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but
which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realizations to the holders of floating charges, even after discharging or making full provisions for
preferential creditor claims and expenses out of the floating charge realizations, the Prescribed Part (as
defined below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

Seventh ranking claims: unsecured creditors, as follows:

  - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets,
as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; and

   - secondly, statutory interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (which as at the date of this
Offering Memorandum is 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of
liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration where consent has been given to
make distributions;

Eighth ranking claims: non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.
This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman
Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and

Ninth ranking claims: shareholders. If any surplus remains following distributions to creditors, this will be
distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

An administrator or liquidator of a company would be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the
proceeds of realization of that company’s assets subject to a floating charge for the benefit of unsecured
creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge
realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net
floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of
£600,000 which was increased on April 6, 2020, up to £800,000 (although the maximum aggregate cap
will remain £600,000 where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a
first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, unless a later floating charge (over any of the
company’s assets) ranks equally or in priority). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured
creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to the creditors.
The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. Whether the assets
that are subject to floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the
company’s assets at the time that any floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the time.

**_Avoidance of transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed
into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or
guarantee.


-----

Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English
Guarantor, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by
such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of insolvency (as described
below) in respect of an English Guarantor is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of the
relevant English Guarantee would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as
valid.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences
(as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

Subject to certain changes introduced by CIGA (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—
_Statutory demands and winding-up petitions” below), in a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency_
is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date
the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of
insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

**_Connected persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a
“connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge
by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue or preferences is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a
shadow director of the company; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate
of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a
relative of the individual’s husband or wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates,
have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the
groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by
treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an
associate.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to
any security interest or guarantee granted by an English company include, without limitation, the following
described below.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
(or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction
at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if (i) the English company is unable to pay
its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act) (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was
unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a “connected person”),
(ii) the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years
ending with the onset of insolvency from the date of the transaction and (iii) if the English company
received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money
or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.


-----

However, as a result of the changes introduced by CIGA as to when a winding-up would be deemed to
commence (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—Statutory demands and winding-up
_petitions” below), certain changes have been made to the length of the time period prior to the liquidation_
of an English company in which a liquidator may seek to challenge a transaction at an undervalue, so as
to ensure that transactions that might otherwise have been applicable prior to the changes introduced by
CIGA as to when winding-up is deemed to commence, would also be caught. As such, a liquidator may
look back in the period which begins with the later of (i) 2 years before the day on which the winding-up
was presented and (ii) the day 2 years and 6 months before the winding-up order was made, and ends on
the day in which the winding-up order was made.

However, a court will generally not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the
transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore
the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable
to pay its debts (except in the case of a transaction entered into with a connected party, where there is a
rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the relevant
transaction).

In addition, section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 introduced
section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators
may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any claim
under section 238 of the Insolvency Act.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee,
(or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a
preference. It will only be a preference if (i) at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes
unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act); (ii) the English
company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the
beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the
date the English company gives the preference ending with the onset of insolvency; and (iii) the
transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of
the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent
liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not
been entered into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. If the court determines that the
transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the
position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

However, as a result of the changes introduced by CIGA as to when a winding-up would be deemed to
commence (see “Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020—Statutory demands and winding-up
_petitions” below), CIGA has also introduced certain changes to the length of the time period prior to the_
liquidation of an English company in which a liquidator may seek to challenge a preference, so as to
ensure that a preference that might otherwise have been applicable prior to the changes introduced by
CIGA as to when winding-up is deemed to commence would also be caught. As such, a liquidator may, in
respect of connected party preferences, look back in the period which begins with the later of (i) 2 years
before the day on which the winding-up was presented and (ii) the day 2 years and 6 months before the
winding-up order was made, and ends on the day in which the winding-up order was made. For
unconnected party preferences, the liquidator may look back in the period which begins with the later of
(i) 6 months before the day on which the winding-up petition was presented and (ii) the day 12 months
before the winding-up order was made, and ends on the day in which the winding-up order was made.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was
unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor,
unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case it is presumed that the
company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate
that there was, in fact, no such influence. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property


-----

of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not such person is the person to whom the
preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired
from a person other than the English company in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant
circumstances, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who
received a benefit from the preference in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances
to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in
respect of a preference given to that person at a time when such person was a creditor of the English
company.

In addition, section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 introduced
section 246ZD to the Insolvency Act from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators
may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
preference claim under section 239 of the Insolvency Act.

**_Transactions defrauding creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was made for the purpose of
putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or
of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or
may make, and one or more of the criteria set out in the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Act is
satisfied, such transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This
provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the
court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or
administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K.
Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within which the
challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company
does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not such person is the
person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest
in property which was acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in
good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or
administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit
transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit,
either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary
principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company at
any time during the three year period ending with day on which the company entered into administration
or went into liquidation.

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or
other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money
or perform any other onerous act, by serving a prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be
unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a
company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is
financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain.
However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to a contract in so far as it has been
performed and a disclaimer would be construed so as to interfere with the rights of third parties as little as
possible.


-----

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of the English Guarantees must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a
transaction must be allowed by the relevant English Guarantor’s memorandum and articles of
association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the
grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some
comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Guarantor in good faith;
however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit
must be established for each English Guarantor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that such director
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the relevant English Guarantor
for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or
insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. The legality, validity and enforceability of the
obligations of the English Guarantors under in respect of the Notes are subject to matters affecting
companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such obligations: (A) are not
prohibited by contracts to which it is party; and (B) have been duly authorized and do not breach or result
in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the documents evidencing such obligations
have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition,
the granting of guarantees by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction
in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company
does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

Enforcement of guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the
legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities
(including guarantees).

**_Foreign currency_**

Under United Kingdom insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for
their debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pounds
sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange
rates prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a
creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration and the holders
of the Notes claim against such English Guarantor in respect of amounts owed under the Notes, the
holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk upon any foreign currency claims being
converted into pounds sterling by the office-holder.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors
which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a
rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by
value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled
to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to
enforce its security, except with its consent. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is
under-secured. Shareholders of the company will also be asked to vote on the CVA.

**_Schemes of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s
liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). A scheme of arrangement is
not a formal insolvency process and as such companies do not need to have commenced insolvency
proceedings in order to propose a scheme. Note that the commencement of a scheme does not trigger a
moratorium on claims or proceedings. An English Guarantor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect
of its financial liabilities including the English Guarantee which could result in the compromise (including
amendment, release or waiver) of creditors’/Noteholders’ claims in respect of such guarantees. In


-----

addition, the Issuer and the non-English Guarantors could also pursue a scheme provided that they are
liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and have a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales.
In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been
found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England and Wales, the
company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have
been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will
be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and
reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new
rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the
company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors
present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme,
irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme
will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected
creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then
needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the
scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the
scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.
Another factor the court will consider (if applicable) when making its decision on sanctioning an English
scheme, is foreign recognition of the scheme.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020 the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) came into effect. CIGA
contains three key measures that may be of particular relevance to the holders of the Notes.

_Moratorium_

CIGA provides for a new, free-standing moratorium for U.K. companies, which is intended to provide a
company in financial distress with breathing space in which to explore its rescue and restructuring options
free from creditor enforcement action. However, there are a number of exclusions in relation to which
companies this applies to and such exclusions are likely to apply to the English Guarantors because
(a) they are party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement, and (b) the
arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment (under Schedule ZA1 Insolvency Act
1986). Such ineligibility of the English Guarantors will apply in this case once the Notes have been
issued.

_Restructuring plan_

CIGA provides for a new restructuring plan procedure which is intended broadly to follow the process for
a scheme of arrangement. A restructuring plan is not a formal insolvency process and as such companies
do not need to have commenced insolvency proceedings in order to propose a restructuring plan. Note
that the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings.
A company can propose a restructuring plan to its creditors (and/or its shareholders) including in relation
to the English Guarantee which could result in the compromise (including amendment, release or waiver)
of creditors’/Noteholders’ claims in respect of such guarantees. Creditors will be divided into classes
based on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following
implementation of the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of
restructuring plan meetings. Each class will then vote on whether they accept the plan and provided that
sufficient creditors approve the plan and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to
sanction the plan, then the plan will be binding on all creditors regardless of whether they, individually or
as a class, approved the plan. The restructuring plan is available not just to companies incorporated
England & Wales but to any company with a sufficient connection to England & Wales that would be
eligible for compulsory liquidation.

There are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan: (a) the
company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or
may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (b) a compromise or arrangement


-----

must be proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) and the purpose of such
compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect of any of the
financial difficulties the company is facing.

Before the court considers the sanction of a restructuring plan, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any
new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors whose rights are affected
by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in the meeting and vote on the plan
but there is no need to include creditors whose rights are not affected. Furthermore, a court may exclude
even a creditor whose rights are affected where it is satisfied that none of the members of that class has
a genuine economic interest in the company.

In respect of a consensual restructuring plan (i.e. one where each class of creditors votes in favor) to be
capable of being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors present and voting (in person or by
proxy) in each class must agree the compromise or arrangement. In respect of a “cram-down”
restructuring plan (i.e., a restructuring plan where there is a dissenting class of creditors), the court may
still sanction a plan, provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any
worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (referred to below);
and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class of creditors, present
and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in
the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. The relevant alternative is whatever the court
considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise or arrangement
were not sanctioned by the court.

The restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will
review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Another factor the court will consider (if
applicable) when making its decision on sanctioning an English restructuring plan, is foreign recognition
of the restructuring plan.

_Statutory demands and winding-up petitions_

CIGA provides for temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid
debts. Specifically, CIGA (as amended by The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020
(Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020): (i) prevents any statutory demands
made against companies in the period between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, from being
used as the basis of a winding-up petition at any point on or after April 27, 2020; and (ii) in respect of any
winding-up petition presented in the period from April 27, 2020 to September 30, 2021, create an
additional condition that must be satisfied before a creditor can obtain a winding-up order against a
company on the grounds that it is unable to pay its debts, namely that any creditor asking the court to
make a winding-up order on those grounds must first demonstrate to the court that the company’s inability
to pay its debts was not caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The time periods within which these
provisions currently apply may also be extended by way of statutory instrument.

Under section 127 of the Insolvency Act certain transactions, including any disposition of the company’s
property and any transfer of shares made after the commencement of a winding-up, unless sanctioned
by the court, are void (see “—Liquidation/winding-up” above). Where a creditor makes a winding-up
petition during the period set out above and the court makes an order for a winding-up of the company,
CIGA shifts the point in time at which a winding-up will be deemed to commence for the purposes of
section 127 of the Insolvency Act from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition to the
making of the winding-up order. Therefore, transactions that are entered into after the presentation of a
winding-up petition during the ‘relevant period’ but prior to the making of the winding-up order will not be
void.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors conduct part of their business activity in France and, to the extent that their
registered office or their main centre of interest within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French


-----

Commercial Code is deemed to be in France, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings
affecting creditors, i.e., mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of
the EU Insolvency Regulation). To the extent that (i) their COMI is deemed to be in France or they have an
establishment in France or (ii), in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their
registered office or main centre of interest within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French
Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered
proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde
_financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation_
proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Pursuant to Article L. 721-8 of the French Commercial Code, specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or
insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together
with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million
euros in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international
jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU
Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main centre of interests within the jurisdiction of
such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having
international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to
specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole
group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group._

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within
the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France
would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU
Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within
the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the EU Restructuring
Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n°2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 (“Loi
**_Pacte”), which grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through_**
ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive. French statute n° 2020-290 dated
March 23, 2020 has extended by four months the periods of time, which have not expired on March 24,
2020, during which the French government is entitled to enact measures that should be enacted by
statute through ordinances. This extension applies to the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive
up until the expiry of the deadline provided under the EU Restructuring Directive.

Once transposed into French law, the EU Restructuring Directive should have a material impact on French
insolvency law, particularly with regards to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under insolvency
proceedings. According to this directive, “affected parties” (i.e., including notably creditors and therefore
the holders of the Notes) shall be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria
for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. Classes shall be formed in such a way that each class
comprises claims or interests with rights that reflect a sufficient commonality of interest based on verifiable
criteria. As a minimum, secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes for the purpose
of adopting a restructuring plan. A restructuring plan shall be deemed to be adopted by the affected
parties, provided that a majority in amount of their claims or interests is obtained in each and every class
(the required majorities shall be laid down by Member States at not higher than 75% in the amount of
claims or interests in each class, it being noted that Member States may require that in addition, a


-----

majority in number of affected parties be obtained in each class). If the restructuring plan is not approved
by each and every class of affected parties, the plan may however be confirmed by a judicial or
administrative authority by applying a cross-class cram-down, providing notably that the following
cumulative conditions are met:

  - creditors that share enough commonality of interest within a class benefit from equality of
treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim;

   - the plan has been notified to all affected parties;

   - the plan complies with the best interest of creditors test (i.e., no dissenting creditor would be
worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of liquidation, whether
piecemeal sale or sale as a going concern or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if
the restructuring plan were not to be confirmed);

  - as the case may be, any new financing necessary to implement the restructuring plan does not
unfairly prejudice the interest of creditors;

  - the plan has a reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor or ensuring the
viability of the business;

  - the plan has been approved:

   - by a majority of the voting classes of affected parties, provided that at least one of those classes
is a secured creditors class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class; or, failing that,

   - by at least one of the voting classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law,
impaired parties, other than an equity-holders class or any other class which, upon a valuation of
the debtor as a going-concern, would not receive any payment or keep any interest, or, where so
provided under national law, which could be reasonably presumed not to receive any payment or
keep any interest, if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied under national law; it
is specified that member states may increase the minimum number of voting classes of affected
parties or, where so provided under national law, of impaired parties;

   - the plan complies with the relative priority rule (i.e., dissenting voting classes of affected creditors
are treated at least as favorably as any other class of the same rank and more favorably than any
junior class). By way of derogation, Member States may instead provide that the plan shall comply
with the absolute priority rule (i.e., a dissenting voting class of creditors must be satisfied in full
before a more junior class may receive any distribution or keep any interest under the restructuring
plan); and

   - no class of affected parties can, under the restructuring plan, receive or keep more than the full
amount of its claims or interests.

Member States may maintain or introduce provisions derogating from the conditions above where they
are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and where the restructuring plan
does not unfairly prejudice the rights or interests of any affected parties.

**_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 crisis_**

Please note that due to the COVID-19 crisis, certain temporary measures have recently been enacted by
the French Government to adapt French insolvency law to the health crisis (Law No. 2020-1525 dated 7
December, Ordinance No. 2020-1443 dated 25 November 2020 and Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated 20
May 2020). These measures are detailed in the sections below.

Note that, due to the COVID-19 crisis, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may
be put in place within the following weeks/months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, creditors could be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French
Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the
payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus


-----

deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower
than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall
first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil
Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty
for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. A
creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the
course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted
_Proceedings” below)._

**_Warning procedure (procédure d’alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for certain warning
procedures, which take place in stages. If a company is incorporated as a société anonyme, when there
are elements which the statutory auditor of the company believes place the company’s existence as a
going concern in jeopardy, he or she must request company management to provide an explanation for
the situation (Stage 1 of the warning procedure). Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures
by management, the statutory auditor must request that the board of directors (or the equivalent body)
be convened and may request to be heard by the president of the relevant commercial court (Stage 2 of
the warning procedure). The minutes of the board of directors’ meeting are sent to the employee
representatives during Stage 2, as Stage 1 proceedings are confidential.

If, despite of the statutory auditor’s request, the board of directors (or an equivalent body) has not been
convened, if the statutory auditor has not been summoned to the meeting of the board, or if the statutory
auditor concludes that in the context of this meeting satisfactory explanations have not been given and
appropriate corrective measures have not been not taken by management, then management must
convene a shareholders’ meeting at which the auditors present a special report on the state of the
company. This report is also sent to the employee representatives (Stage 3 of the warning procedure). In
practice, the statutory auditor commonly invites the management to convene a shareholders’ meeting. If
management fails to act, then the statutory auditor convenes the shareholders’ meeting himself/herself
and sets the agenda. If the statutory auditor considers that decisions made by the shareholders during
the shareholders’ meeting do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, he or she must
inform the president of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may also request to
be heard on the matter (Stage 4 of the warning procedure).

Similar warning procedures exist for companies not registered as a société anonyme, with minor
differences in technical details of the procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their
absence, the employees’ representatives have similar rights.

The president of the relevant commercial court can also summon the management to provide
explanations on elements which he or she believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in
jeopardy, or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite
his injunction.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health state of emergency that was imposed by the
French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated
May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, have amended the
warning procedure to provide that, until and including December 31, 2021, where warning procedure is
initiated in accordance with articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, if
the statutory auditor considers the state of the relevant company to require immediate action, and has
determined that the director is refusing to take such action or is taking insufficient measures, the statutory
auditors may inform the president of the relevant commercial court concurrently with his or her initial
report made to the director, the chairman of the board of directors (conseil d’administration) or of the
supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be.

In such case, the statutory auditor may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of
the court his or her findings and proceedings, and may produce copies of any relevant documents. The
statutory auditor is released from his or her obligation of professional secrecy towards the president of
the relevant commercial court under these circumstances.


-----

This exceptional procedure does not preclude the application of the ordinary procedure detailed above.

**_Out-of-court and in-court proceedings_**

French law distinguishes between:

  - court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation), which are voluntary proceedings in
which the debtor seeks the help of a third party to negotiate an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties with a view to, in particular,
restructuring its indebtedness. These proceedings are confidential. The third party is appointed by
the President of the competent commercial court upon proposal of the debtor company, but the
discussions themselves are conducted outside the court; and

court-administered proceedings (procédures collectives), which are proceedings, during which payments
by the debtor and legal actions by the creditors are suspended (automatic stay). These proceedings are
public and involve all creditors (except for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as discussed
below).

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking
into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an
earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for
fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision
that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of
insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see “—The ‘hardening period’ (période
_suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings” below)._

**_Court-assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties without being insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) (or for 45
calendar days or less in the case of conciliation proceedings) may in certain conditions request the
commencement of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to
reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders, e.g., an agreement to reduce or
reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
_mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties (including notably_
economic or financial) but are not insolvent (see—”Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal
and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the order of the President of the court appointing the
_mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-_
appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the
_mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints_
him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting
any proposal. Any agreement between the debtor and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement
nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings
and creditors are not barred from taking enforcement or legal action against the debtor or its assets to
recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do
so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace
period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement
reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. The order of the
president of the court appointing the Mandataire ad hoc shall be notified for information purposes to the
debtor’s auditors.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above) or
has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for


-----

the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They
are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be
suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may
last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator,
the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the
debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its
request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place
afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the
court or the court itself.

The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its
indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement
nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (save for their disclosure to statutory
auditors if any and subject to the below) and do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and
creditors are not barred from taking enforcement or legal action against the debtor or its assets to recover
their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and
creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation
_judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to article L. 611-7_
of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge
that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see
“—Grace Periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing
for payment, even where the formal notice asking the debtor to pay was sent before conciliation
proceedings commenced; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may
condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having
commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement
(whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who
were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security
administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that
were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur
if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and taking into account
the conditions of implementation of the conciliation agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the
president of the commercial court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding
upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors
party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and
enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain
confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the commercial court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the social and economic
committee (previously known as works council) or employee representatives, as the case may be, must
be convened if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end
to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive
as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory
creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described
above and, in addition:

   - the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the
existence of the proceedings, the amount of any New Money Lien (as defined below) and the
guarantees and security interests granted to secure the performance of the conciliation
agreement, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except
vis-à-vis the social and economic committee or employee representatives that are informed of the
content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at
the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court;

   - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders


-----

providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all
pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain employment
claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard
proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

  - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or
judicial reorganization, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their
holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later
than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’
committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of
debate);

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to
its statutory auditors; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings,
the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test” above), and therefore the starting date of the
hardening period (as defined below see “—The ‘hardening period’ (période suspecte) in judicial
reorganization and liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than
the date of the final decision approving (homologation) the agreement by the court (except in case
of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution
_de l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

  - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a
grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained
above; and

   - joint debtors or a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security
interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation
agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation
proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president
of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its
termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any
individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the
conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard
or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the
creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security
interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is likely to
meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on
the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total
sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) that
could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by
the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public
prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the
designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request
submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire


-----

_ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the_
professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and
void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement
being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself
entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic
commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before
three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated
December 7, 2020, and Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020, have modified conciliation
proceedings to provide that:

(1) with respect to proceedings commenced within the period of time between 24 August 2020 and
31 December 2021 (included), upon request of the conciliateur, the president of the court may
extend, one or several times, the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of ten months;
and

(2) until December 31, 2021, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a
request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the
conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the president of the commercial court in
ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:

     - the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a
payment default;

     - the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or
immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s
assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or

     - the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim.

In addition to the abovementioned measures, the debtor may petition the judge that commenced
conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code
(see “—France—Grace periods” above) even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any
suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the
conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent
(see “—Insolvency Test” above). When the situation of the debtor does not show difficulties that it cannot
overcome, the court will first invite the debtor to petition the president of the court for the opening of
conciliation proceedings (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings” above). The court will then rule on the sole
request for the opening of safeguard proceedings. Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited
to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is
requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such
appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period”
(being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on
the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to
18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft
safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not have
effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the
judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission
_de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission_
_d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court._

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation
_des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_


-----

representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may
convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings
(a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard
plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings end, or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the
debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

  - the court may decide on the conversion at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, except in the case of (i)(b), as
described below;

   - the court may also act upon its own initiative, except in the case of (i)(b), as described below; and

   - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller
(“contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any).

In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request
of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan
was approved by the relevant creditors’ committees and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting or (ii) at
the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances.

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated
December 7, 2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that:

   - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization
proceedings, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525
dated December 7, 2020, provides for a new safeguard or reorganization privilege (the “S/R Lien”),
applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 21, 2020 and December 31,
2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing
granted, with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings, for
the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period;

   - the S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through
a share capital increase, by any person;

a. during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its
sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy
judge, or

b. for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as
approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified
that the decision endorsing or modifying the plan must mention all claims benefiting from
the lien, as well as the relevant amounts.

  - claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and
post-commencement claims except with respect to (i) the employees’ super-privilege claims,
(ii) procedural costs, (iii) claims benefitting from a New Money Lien, (iv) pre-petition claims secured
by a real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and (v) post-petition
wages claims not advanced by the French wages guarantee fund in the event of on-going or
subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings; and

   - such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for
the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/
goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can


-----

authorize payments for pre-petition debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued
operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary
estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved
by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation:_ this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory
auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a
turnover of €20 million or less unless, upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of
the bankruptcy judge, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the
proposed debt settlement provided under the draft plan. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to
legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible,
_provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-_
appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a
proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such
claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors consulted in writing that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement
proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual
creditor in writing) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a
list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and
any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (contrôleur).

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_
that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting
from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural
businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the
deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off
of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at
least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment
date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the
plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received
had he been paid in accordance with the specific rules in order to ensure that the full amount of the claim
is repaid within the 10 year period.

_Committee-based consultation:_ This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a
statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert_comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s_
or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the supervising judge in the case of debtors that do
not meet the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors
committees that are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that
arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

   - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances
in favor of the debtor (or their successors or assignees of a claim acquired from a supplier) (the
“credit institutions committee”); and


-----

   - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the
claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate and who elected to be
member of such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers
committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and
including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of
such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders general meeting”), in which all such holders
are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of
those obligations. The bondholders will therefore vote within the bondholders general meeting.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or
bondholders general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not
itself be a member of the committee or the bondholders general meeting.

The proposed plan:

  - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

   - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of
claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debtfor-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital
increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the
provisions of the plan, where applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to
the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of
any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority of the amount of the claims held by
members of such committee that expressed a vote in each committee and in the bondholders general
meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire).
Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The
period may be extended or shortened by the supervising judge at the request of the debtor or the courtappointed administrator, but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote
or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The
court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its
voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the
matter may be ruled upon by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings at the
request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights.
In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides
for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are
admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims
of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders’ general meeting in accordance with
the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court.
The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required
shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the
safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those
who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).


-----

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or
because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the courtappointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the
plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the
court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In
such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process
described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that
the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of
securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting
is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the
meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the
meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions:_ public creditors (financial administrations, social
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions
that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic
operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination
agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine
possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs
_de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect_
taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 as
supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, and Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated 25
November 2020 have amended safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings as follows:

1. Until 31 December 2021 (included), on the basis of the certificate drawn up by a certified
accountant or the statutory auditor, liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall
include those claims admitted and not challenged as well as those “identifiable” claims (in
particular when the deadline for filing proofs of claim has not expired yet):

This includes liabilities foreseeable and reasonably likely to enable the Court to assess the
seriousness of the plan (which requires that the debtor’s accounts be accurate, and that
identifiable claims be taken into account, such as those of the French wages guarantee fund);

This implies a temporary exception to the principle (established in case law) according to which
the plan must be drawn up in consideration of the filed claims (even if they are challenged);

2. Until 31 December 2021 (included), upon request of the judicial administrator (if appointed) or
the creditors’ representative, the bankruptcy judge may shorten the deadline for individual
consultation of the creditors from 30 to 15 days.

3. Until 31 December 2021 (included), formalities for consultings creditors are relaxed: proposals
for the settlement of liabilities included in the plan and any responses to these proposals may
be notified by any means allowing the creditor’s representative to establish with certainty the
date of their receipt, both in the context of the individual consultation of creditors and the
consultation of bondholders within the framework of the bondholder’s general meeting (it is
unclear whether this way of notification also apply to credit and credit institutions or assimilated
institutions’ committee and main suppliers’ committee).

4. The duration of Safeguard and reorganization plans has been amended as follows:

(i) Until 31 December 2021 (included): extension for a two-year period upon request of the
public prosecutor or the court-appointed trustee in charge of supervising the execution of
the plan.

(ii) Until 31 December 2021 (included): in case of substantial modification of the plan, its
duration is extended to a maximum period of 12 years.


-----

With respect to (i) above, it should be specified that this extension does not require going through
the process of substantial modification of the plan (modification substantielle du plan), as the
payment instalment deadlines initially set are adapted by the president of the court or the whole
court extending through the duration of the plan, with possible deviation from the obligation to
pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3 and possible application of grace
periods provisions (see above “Grace Periods”) within the limit of the new term of the plan so
extended.

5. Until 31 December 2021 (included), as part of a substantial modification of the plan process,
where the modification is relating to the plan’s repayment terms and conditions, those creditors
failing to reply to the registered letter provided for in Article R. 626-45 of the French commercial
code will be deemed to have accepted the proposed modifications, except in case of debt
write-offs or conversions into shares that give or may give access to share capital.

Where creditors are consulted within the framework of creditors’ committees, the procedures
for consultation of the committees continue to apply.

Like most decisions issued in insolvency proceedings, the court decision approving the safeguard or
reorganization plan or acknowledging its completed execution may be appealed under specific
circumstances.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée), allowing a restructuring plan to be rapidly
approved by the two-thirds vote of the creditors’ committees and bondholders’ general meeting applicable
in safeguard proceedings.

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been
designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

   - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial
Code; or

   - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant
and who have (i)more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT)
or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated
December 7, 2020, provides that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced
between May 21, 2020 and December 31, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted,
the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the
debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

  - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

  - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a
position to overcome; and

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as
a going concern that is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial
accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum
of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a
maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.


-----

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions
committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of
a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to
any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the
case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for
the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/
goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid
only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms.
Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration
and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will
continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal
terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a
committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan
_de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde_
_financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major_
suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above
(see “—Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard—committee-based consultation”)), to the extent
compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular, the
creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed
safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of it being notified to them in the case of accelerated
safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners
do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in the committee-based consultation of
standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt write-offs and conversion
of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent).
No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not
belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors
outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law
n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, provides that for proceedings commenced between May 21,
2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within
the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public
prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case
may be) be opened.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings drawn up by the debtor and certified
by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings unless
the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard,
_Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation_
_Proceedings”)._

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may
be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if
the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization
or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation


-----

proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de
_facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil_
liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court,
after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate,
it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same
would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court
considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time
during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers
(contrôleurs), the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial
reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is
manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the courtappointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court
as controllers (contrôleurs), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the
preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount
of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may
last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a
draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan, with the contribution of the
debtor), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will
assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the
court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial
reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see
above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially with respect to the committees of
creditors, the bondholders general meeting and the powers of the court adopting the judicial
reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made
to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the
request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers (“contrôleurs”) (if any), the_
public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de
_l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the_
observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as supplemented by law n°2020-1525 dated
December 2020, modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as
defined and detailed above see “—France—Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard”).

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L.
626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee
(mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the
shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the
shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a
modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization
plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can
order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business
described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls
(within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150


-----

employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or
regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital
appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the
continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the
business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the
proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the
company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification,
the insolvency court may either:

  - appoint a trustee (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for
in the reorganization plan; or

   - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of
all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital
modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a
majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a
blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed
unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that
their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the
duration of the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified
judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and
perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the
proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of
payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of
the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

  - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to
manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered
by the court (three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will
generally apply); and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale,
a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law)
being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

   - As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchasers can, under certain conditions,
cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining
to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate
assets) is offered at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will
tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going
concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors.

  - Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors,
including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase
price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception:

  - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay remaining instalments due to creditors having granted
financing for the acquisition of assets acting as collateral for such creditors and included in the
sale of the business plan; and

   - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over
inventory or certain types of the pledges over shares, but not mortgagees of real estate assets)


-----

would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and
therefore in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured
or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties.

   - Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of
several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in
different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred
assets could be significantly lower than their in bonis market value;

   - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

   - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

  - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude
the sale agreement with the bidder); or

   - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid
on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders
submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such
hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is
questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its
consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient
funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes
impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to
the difficulty of selling the assets;

   - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire
in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than
18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may
not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important
because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the
court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (such as an
insolvency officer or the public prosecutor) so requests. These include transfers of assets for no
consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor
significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of
payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary
course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not
yet become final to serve as guarantee or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of
the French Civil Code, security granted for debts (including a security to secure a guarantee obligation)
previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer
of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt


-----

simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights
already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized
declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L.
526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions
for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures
(saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines
that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions
relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets
from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) are also voidable when entered into during the six-month
period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must
be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate
to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”.

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard,_**
**_Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration
of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the
continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not
enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation
_of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the_
_opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme_
Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard,
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed
administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes
the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can
require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may
have been in default (including in payment default), but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its
post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on
delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity
of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view
to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above (which it may do for a period of
three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the
date of the court decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on
which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

   - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest
can no longer be compounded);

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts
and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required
by the continued operation of the business);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the
proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation
period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

  - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/
goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not,
will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with
certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are
duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the court-appointed trustee
in charge of supervising the execution of the plan or the judicial liquidator within one year of the
end of the observation period;


-----

   - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may
not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated
safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings (during the
observation period only with respect to judicial reorganization proceedings)) with respect to any
claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings or non-privileged postcommencement claims if the objective of such legal action is;

  - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as
described below);

  - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

   - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire)
of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or
immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union at the time of the
opening of the insolvency proceedings, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would
not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the
terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are
commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located
outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they
were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided
otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party);

   - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat
_en cours), will be required._

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
(“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan
(“plan de redressement”).

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative
within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des
_annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside_
metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts,
with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity
date. Creditors whose claims have not been filed with the creditors representative, are, except for limited
exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees do
not need to file a proof of claim in respect of their wage-related claims and are preferred creditors under
French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the
creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has
informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is
deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are
allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the
admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described
above.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a
list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its
statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular
process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the
amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’
time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would belong to the
financial institutions’ committee or the bondholders general meeting) would have to file their proofs of
claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the
plan.


-----

If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of
its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of
the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and
settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees
(for the super-privileged part of their claims), post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials
fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement
privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation
proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate
are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this
order of priority which, for example does not apply to creditors benefiting from an enforceable retention
right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may demand that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors
may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting
of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) interfered with the
management of the debtor (immixtion caractérisée dans la gestion) or (iii) obtained security or guarantees
that are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities
in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the
court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto
manager of such company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, article L 651-2 of the French Commercial
Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the
debtor, such creditor being deemed de facto manager may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities
over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may
be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If
such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the
shortfall amount. However, de jure or de facto managers cannot be held liable on the grounds of article
L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in the event of simple negligence on their part in the
management of the company.

**_Limitation on French Guarantors’ Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or
infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial
Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition or the subscription of
its own shares by a third party.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or
declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant
guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these
criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and
whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to
which French case law provides no clear guidance.


-----

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent
directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or
indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar
arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor
under its Guarantee.

Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any
other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such
French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By
virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Guarantee should the portion of the proceeds of the Notes made available to the French
Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s
length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Guarantors as
regards its obligations.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease
in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees
to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged
in the context of the insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the court-appointed trustee in charge of supervising the execution of the plan
(commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared
unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant debtor (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the
safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the
claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so;
(ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of a claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) or the trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization_
plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the
counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors
(existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into
for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary).

If a court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes or
the granting of such Guarantee could be (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors if the claim
was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the trustee in charge of overseeing
the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or
(ii) declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a
result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes or the
Guarantees and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly,
from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held
liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code
pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or
reorganization plan which is put to the vote of the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend
_en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior_
to the commencement of the safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received
no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The German Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in
Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of a
German Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “center of main interests” in
Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag)
is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings
would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings over the
assets of the German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions.

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the
United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain interest for unsecured claims following the commencement of insolvency
proceedings and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes more than other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of
certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit),
meaning, according to case law, that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts due or falling
due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision
of the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is overindebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its
assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going
concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 months forecast horizon. If
a limited liability company(Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung),_ a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any
other entity not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of
illiquidity and/or overindebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such entity and, in
certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without delay but, in the case
of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of overindebtedness at the latest six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these
obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in
the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the
German Guarantor being unable within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being
24 months) to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an
obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is overindebted
(Überschuldung) it may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” moratorium proceedings
(vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for
a successful restructuring. Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield
proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In this case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit
enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an
independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Upon such filing by the debtor, the


-----

court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other
than with respect to immovable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the
debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall
prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession”
proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to
enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as
these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation
of the debtor’s business.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the
management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary
insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include
safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even
the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary
insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by
unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

(a) a balance sheet total of at least EUR 6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor
is overindebted);

(b) revenue of at least EUR 12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial
year preceding the filing; and/or

(c) 50 or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the
selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung); and appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) Sachwalter)._

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (a) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has
been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or overindebtedness and (b) if there are sufficient assets to cover
at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient
to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (for
example, creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung
_mangels Masse)._

Unless the court has granted debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will
only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the debtor), upon opening of
the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who
has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer
entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to
change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors’
assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (a) a simple majority of votes
cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming
insolvency administrator and (b) the proposed individual being eligible to be officeholder, (i.e., sufficiently
qualified, business experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor-inpossession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to


-----

continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any general unsecured liabilities.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See
“—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer”).

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings
against any German Guarantor would include, among other things, the following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of the German Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the
(preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative
of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected
by the German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null
and void by operation of law;

(c) claims against any German Guarantor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the
rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code; and

(d) any person that has a right for segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene
_Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the_
insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters)
unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements
that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)),
who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have
to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the
insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action
brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency
petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings
are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the
insolvency proceedings separately but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions
of the German Insolvency Code. Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency
proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets
are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after
insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code authorizes
the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right
to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of
insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the
relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right
(a) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte) (for example, pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) or
transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (b) to collect any claims that are subject to
security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature,
it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of
pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency
estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the
benefit of the secured creditors. There is, however, no authoritative case law on this question.


-----

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges for
(a) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (b) realizing the secured assets
(Verwertungskosten)—which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds
plus VAT (if any); in the case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the cost of
assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) may not be deducted from the
enforcement proceeds—are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to
an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“Excess Proceeds”) will be allocated to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings
(for example, fees for and expenses of the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as at
the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be
distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes. If a
German Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its
assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction
of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds
obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The Excess Proceeds resulting from such
collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees by the German Guarantors
after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it
may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed
to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which
requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a
debt-for-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a
debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency
law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German
insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a
general principle, the claims arising from a guarantee may be enforced against a German Guarantor
outside the insolvency proceedings over any other entity. Any insolvency proceeding over the assets of
the Issuer would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire
group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Guarantor to
subsequently file for insolvency. On April 13, 2017, the German legislator passed an act to facilitate the
mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen),
which came into force on April 21, 2018. This act is mainly intended to facilitate the coordination of and
cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation
of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and
liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but
rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies:

(a) a single court may assume jurisdiction for another group entity’s insolvency proceedings
(Gruppen-Gerichtsstand);

(b) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies
is facilitated;

(c) coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and

(d) certain parties may apply for coordination proceedings (Koordinationsverfahren) and the
appointment of a coordinator (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a coordination
plan (Koordinationsplan).


-----

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides in its Articles 61 et seq. for a similar concept, which shall be
applicable on an opt-in basis to the extent that proceedings relating to different members of the same
group of companies have been opened in more than one Member State of the European Union.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law
(including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for
the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the
covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the Trustee
being considered in a shareholder-like position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an
insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from a Guarantee
would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated
insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German
Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these
subordinated insolvency claims to be filed, which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases
governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after
the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Insolvency law-related development in connection with COVID-19_

In response to the developments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 25, 2020, the German
legislature passed a bill for the temporary amendment of civil, insolvency and criminal proceedings law
(Gesetz _zur_ _Abmilderung_ _der_ _Folgen_ _der_ _Covid-19-Pandemie_ _im_ _Zivil-,_ _Insolvenz-_ _und_
_Strafverfahrensrecht), including the Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and_
to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic (“CovInsAG”).
CovInsAG, as amended from time to time, entered into force on March 27, 2020, but with certain retroactive effects. Among other things, CovInsAG provided for a suspension of the obligation to file for
insolvency from March 1, 2020 until April 30, 2021 under certain circumstances. As of May 1, 2021 and
given that the suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency proceedings has not been further
extended, the pre-CovInsAG regime applies. In addition, the CovInsAG also contains some privileges
with regard to insolvency claw back rules and repayment of loans granted in the suspension period
between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021.

_GmbH Limitation Language_

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net
assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to
guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered
disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue
guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, certain
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to
subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited partnership
with a GmbH as its only general partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG). Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and
exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the
extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as
general partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if
the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be
further reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the security documents (if any) provided
by the German Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the
Guarantees and the Indenture is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which
the respective Guarantee or security granted by the relevant Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that
debtor-in-possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten)


-----

transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were
effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance periods. The
administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances,
extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of
insolvency proceedings. On March 29, 2017, the German legislator passed an act for the improvement of
legal certainty concerning claw back pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the German
Avoidance Act (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der
_Insolvenzordnung und nach dem Anfechtungsgesetz), which entered into force on April 5, 2017 (subject_
to certain transitional provisions). The amendments to the German Insolvency Code and the German
Voidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, among other things, the provisions on voidance for
intentionally disadvantaging third-party creditors (Vorsatzanfechtung), cash transactions (Bargeschäfte)
and interest accruing on voidance claims (Verzinsung des Anfechtungsanspruchs).

The payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of voidance as set forth in the German
Insolvency Code. If the validity or enforceability of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the
Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been made
under the Notes, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be
repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of Notes would only have a general unsecured claim
under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be voided in the following cases:

(a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during
the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the
creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor
was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of
circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing);

(b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was
not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such
creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last
month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after
such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or
third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such
detrimental effect);

(c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the
three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings
and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of
either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

(d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (for example, whereby a debtor grants
security (including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been
granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with intent to prejudice


-----

the insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the other party knew of
such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary
knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other
creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to
obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case such knowledge
(solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction
disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or
enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung)
(whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such
creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings or at a time after the filing;

(f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and a related
party (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be
challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as at the time the contract was concluded; in
relation to corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations,
members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and
other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

(g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung)
for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan made to the debtor or an
economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during
the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings
or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the
last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not
apply (A) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in
management and (B) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the
first time acquires shares during overindebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the
purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

(h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of
the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder
_Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid_
(subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (for example, a German Guarantor) was unable to pay its
debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed,
or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be.
A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it
knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the
relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including
a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such
creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words
“imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by
“actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment
agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms
(Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did
not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related party,”
there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge”. Any amounts obtained from
transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.


-----

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims
by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the
payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Voidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz).
The conditions for voidance under the German Voidance Act differ to a certain extent from the abovedescribed rules under the German Insolvency Code and the voidance periods are calculated from the
date when a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Court of
Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with
the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction would be aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the
guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or has reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

_Pre-insolvency Restructuring Plan_

As at January 1, 2021, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) came into force in
Germany, implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring
Act (StaRUG) provides for a new restructuring procedure, which is available to companies that have their
COMI in Germany and that face impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), (i.e., that the debtor
will predominantly likely be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (ordinarily measured over a
period of 24 months), but that are not considered to have reached illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness.
The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Corporate Stabilization and
Restructuring Act (StaRUG). Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency
proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency”.)

Following a vote by creditors on a restructuring plan, the debtor is entitled to restructure certain liabilities
and security granted by the debtor or its affiliates and to take corporate measures. A qualified majority of
creditors voting in favor of the plan is required for its adoption. A restructuring plan may cover, among
others, the reduction of claims, extension of maturity dates, amendments of multilateral agreements,
intercreditor agreements and bond indentures. However, claims of employees, pension liabilities,
compensation claims for intentional damages and fines cannot be subject to the restructuring plan. In the
case of a group of companies, restructuring proceedings may only be conducted separately for each
entity. In this context, it is possible that, upon request, a court will become competent for the restructurings
of all companies belonging to the group. The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
provides for the respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), which implemented the law to facilitate group insolvencies.

Generally, a debtor is responsible for preparing the restructuring plan. The involvement of the competent
restructuring court is not required by law and proceedings can, under certain circumstances, even be
conducted without the need for any public notices. The debtor may also apply for involvement of the
court, which may include the following stabilization and restructuring instruments, which are available for
all debtors excluding financial institutions such as banks and insurances companies: (i) the court
organizes the plan voting process, (ii) the court assesses the plan on a preliminarily basis, (iii) the court
imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of claims against the debtor and the realization of rights to
objects of the debtor’s assets for a period between three and eight months and (iv) the official plan
approval by the court.

Creditors that are affected by the plan vote in different groups on the restructuring plan. Therefore, the
debtor will divide the relevant creditors that are affected by the plan into different classes. The
classification of creditors has to be fair and appropriate without taking into account unlawful
considerations. Prior to voting, creditors have at least 14 days to consider the proposed plan. In order for
the plan to be adopted, at least 75% of the voting rights in each group must consent to the plan. In the
case of a group rejecting the plan it can be crammed down, if the majority of groups (more than 50%)
voted in favor of the plan and certain other requirements are met (cross-class cram down). Dissenting
creditors can object to the plan or file an immediate appeal against the confirmation decision by the court.
The plan becomes binding for dissenting creditors only if the court approves the plan.


-----

Generally, the mere filing for the restructuring procedure with the court or the mere application of the
aforementioned stabilization and restructuring instruments does not permit the termination or
acceleration, by a creditor, of agreements to which the debtor is a party or provide grounds for a creditor
to refuse the fulfilment of its existing obligations. In addition, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring
Act (StaRUG) provides for a relief from the so-called “creditors’ liability”. The mere filing for the
restructuring procedure with the court or the mere application of the aforementioned stabilization and
restructuring instruments are not viewed as evidence of actions that contra bonos mores delay the
insolvency or as actions taken with the intent of detrimentally influencing the position of the other
creditors.

Any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan approved by the relevant court are not subject to
avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved,
unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by the debtor
and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to
shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor.

Should a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its COMI in Germany initiate restructuring
proceedings, the following are among the most relevant consequences for the holders of Notes:

  - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the negotiation and drafting of a
restructuring plan and the restructuring proceedings;

  - any measures (such as a reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) with
a majority of 75% of the claims’ nominal value (no headcount) or by way of a so-called cross-class
cram down by other classes under certain circumstances;

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder
of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a crossclass cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes;

   - claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by
the restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest
or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the
ranking of the security right);

   - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring
proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

   - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or,
if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a
moratorium.

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) only came into force on January 1, 2021,
no corresponding practice or relevant court decisions exist as at the date of this Offering Memorandum
and only future practice and court decisions will show how effective proceedings are under StaRUG.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The German Guarantors are formed under the laws of Germany.

Germany is a signatory of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”). The courts of Germany therefore recognize and enforce
international arbitral awards subject to the conditions set out in the New York Convention and sections
1061 to 1065 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).

Service of process in Germany is generally effected by the court and not by the parties to the
proceedings. Service of process from parties in non-German countries must be effected in accordance
with international treaties. In relation to the United States, the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965
on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (“Hague
**Convention”) will apply. Germany has not accepted the option of direct service of documents through**
mail provided for in Article 10 of the Hague Convention. Therefore, service has to be effected through the
proper authorities in charge of implementing the Hague Convention in Germany. Documents will have to
be accompanied by a translation into German. Alternatively, a German entity may agree to appoint a
process agent abroad to accept service of documents in another jurisdiction. In that case, there will be no


-----

need to effect service according to international treaties and the service will be effected according to the
laws of the country in which the process agent was appointed.

A final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state courts in the United States based on civil
liability would generally be recognized by a German court upon satisfaction of all of the following
conditions:

   - the judgment is final and binding (res judicata) under U.S. law;

   - applying German law principles of jurisdiction competence the U.S. court had jurisdiction over the
case under German law;

   - process had been served on the defendant properly and in a timely fashion allowing him to defend
himself or, in the case of non-compliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant has
nevertheless entered an appearance in the proceedings or (ii) does not invoke such
non-compliance in the recognition procedures;

   - the judgment is not incompatible (i) with any prior judgment rendered in Germany nor (ii) with any
prior judgment rendered abroad that is to be recognized in Germany nor were the proceedings for
the judgment incompatible with earlier pending proceedings in Germany;

   - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with essential principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this
context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. court’s civil judgment awarding punitive
damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble
damages, will likely not be enforced in Germany, on the basis of being in conflict with basic
principles of German law. A German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S.
court and recognize damages only to the extent they are necessary to compensate actual losses
or damages; and

  - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received a recognition decision (exequatur) from a competent German court in accordance with
the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in
civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no
assurance that those judgments will be enforceable. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific
kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject
to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium, as well
as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

Finally, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects.
With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of
several other jurisdictions provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings
may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of
witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such
pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

**Italy**

**_Introduction_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain
reserved activities nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where
publicly-owned companies are involved.

Recently a comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency law and the regulation of over-indebtedness
crises has been introduced (the “2019 Reform”). In particular, the Italian Law No. 155 dated October 19,
2017 has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of the Royal Decree No. 267 of
March 16, 1942, as subsequently amended and supplemented and currently in force (the “Italian
**Bankruptcy Law”), on the basis of several guidelines. The purpose of the 2019 Reform was mostly to**
(i) ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by various amendments
(especially in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) allow early awareness
of the financial distress of a business and (iii) safeguard the business’ entrepreneurial potential during a


-----

crisis. Italian Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 (the “Code of Business Crisis and
**Insolvency”), which implemented the Italian Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 and substantially**
reformed the Italian Bankruptcy Law was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale No. 38 of February 14,
2019.

Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code (and certain express repeals in the
criminal sector) which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, according to Article 389 of the Code
of Business Crisis and Insolvency, it was supposed to enter into force 18 months following its publication
in the Gazzetta Ufficiale (i.e., on 15 August 2020). Nevertheless, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic,
such entry into force has been currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the
Italian Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020 (the so-called “Decreto Liquidità”), converted into the Italian
law No. 40 of June 5, 2020. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by the
Italian Bankruptcy Law and other insolvency laws, as currently in force.

**_Therefore, the practical consequences of the implementation of the 2019 Reform and its potential_**
**_impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant_**
**_amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein._**

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

_Certain Italian Insolvency Laws Applicable Prior to Implementation of the Code of Business Crisis and_
_Insolvency_

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. Apart from the 2019
Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law was repeatedly amended in the past years. Certain provisions of
Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to
further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this
respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main
Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a
Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, among others, to Italian Bankruptcy Law (the
“Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 (the date of its publication in the
_Gazzetta Ufficiale) and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, entered_
into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the
amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted
into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the
goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the
“Prodibis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often
been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended
with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation focusing on the continuity and survival
of financially distressed businesses and enhancing prebankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs
when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. There must be a
permanent, and not a temporary, state of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is
insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall or, more generally,
financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into outofcourt arrangements with its creditors, which
may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are subject to review of the court in the event of
a subsequent insolvency, and could possibly be challenged as voidable transactions.

In addition, pursuant to Italian Bankruptcy Law, the following proceedings may be entered into by
companies facing (i) a state of crisis, or (ii) insolvency as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Restructuring outside of a judicial process (concordati stragiudiziali)

A financially distressed company may, with the aim of rescuing its business, enter with its creditors into
outofcourt arrangements (concordati stragiudiziali), which take place without court supervision, nor are


-----

judicial commissioners appointed. However, such informal arrangements are subject to two main risks in
case of subsequent declaration of bankruptcy, which consist of (i) claw-back actions and (ii) application
of criminal sanctions.

Outofcourt reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law

Outofcourt debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their
financial condition. An independent expert appointed by the debtor verifies the feasibility of the
restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company.
Such expert shall meet the professional requirements as set forth by the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the
Italian Civil Code.

Outofcourt debt restructuring agreements are not subject to judicial control nor approval and, therefore,
no application is required to be filed with the court. Outofcourt debt restructuring arrangements are not
required to be approved and consented to by creditors representing a specific majority of all outstanding
claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike incourt prebankruptcy
agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, outofcourt reorganization plans pursuant to
Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection against
creditors’ enforcement actions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the
debtor subsequently declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of
the reorganization plan, under certain conditions: (i) are not subject to clawback action; and (ii) are
exempted from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor
publication in the companies’ register are required and, therefore, the risk of negative reputation or
disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a courtsupervised prebankruptcy composition with creditors
or a debt restructuring agreement[2].

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to
Article 182bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law

Outofcourt agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors representing at
least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts can be sanctioned by the court. An independent expert
appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by
the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, most importantly, that it is capable of
ensuring that nonparticipating creditors are satisfied in full within a 120day term from:

(i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are
already due and payable to the nonparticipating creditors as of such date; or

(ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable
to the nonparticipating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement by the court.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication.
Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue
any enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless
agreed) in relation to preexisting debts. It is worth noting that the debtor is entitled to request a moratorium
while negotiations with creditors are pending. Such request must be published in the companies’ register
and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the
documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to
supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. In such hearing, the
court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and consequently
(i) sanctions the stay period and (ii) sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring
agreement has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within
the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed,
without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium.

2 The publication in the companies’ register is possible upon debtor’s request and would allow for certain tax benefits.


-----

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the content of the
debt restructuring agreements. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the
business by the debtor or by a third party, or for the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain
refinancing agreements, moratoria, writeoffs and/or postponements of claims[3]. Creditors and other
interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the
companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), sanction the agreement
by way of a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements
(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors.

Pursuant to Article 182septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at
least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining
the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the
relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial
creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being
met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative
and that all creditors (adhering and nonadhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have
been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the
remaining 25% of nonparticipating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are
crammed down, with the possibility to challenge such extension. Similarly, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of
that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors
upon an independent expert opinion. The purpose is to prevent financial creditors with modest claims
from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed financial creditors, resulting in the failure
of the overall restructuring. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it
within 30 days of receipt of the application.

The debtor may also enter into a standstill agreement with its creditors which are banks and financial
Intermediaries by which also the non-consenting banks and financial Intermediaries are bound, provided
that: (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to
such negotiations in good faith; and (ii) an expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67,
paragraph 3, letter (d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial
Intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial
Intermediaries which have agreed to the standstill agreement. The banks and financial Intermediaries
which have not agreed to the standstill agreement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days
after having been notified of the same.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of nonfinancial
creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not
participating to a scheme.

It is worth mentioning that the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182septies of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or the standstill agreement shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new
overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new
facilities on third party creditors.

Pursuant to Article 182quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to
the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a courtsupervised prebankruptcy composition with
creditors) has priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to shareholder
financing, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) the
presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a courtsupervised prebankruptcy
composition with creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant
plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of
approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement.

Pursuant to Article 182quinquies, Paragraphs 1 and 4, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, after the filing of an
agreement pursuant to Article 182bis, or of a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 1 or 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law (i.e., a petition for a court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors

3 Pursuant to Article 182-ter of Italian Bankruptcy Law, debt restructuring agreements may also contain a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain overdue taxes.


-----

(concordato preventivo) described below), the court may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur new supersenior
(so called prededucibile) indebtedness, subject to an expert certifying that such financing is functional to
the overall restructuring process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem security (garanzie reali) or by
assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial
needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), issued a report in which they declare that
the new financial indebtedness aims to achieve a better satisfaction of the creditors.

The provision of Article 182quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the courtsupervised prebankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to Article 182quinquies, Paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis,
paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of a petition pursuant to Article 161, paragraph
6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) described below), also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur new
supersenior (so-called prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related
to the company’s business. The debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify
(i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds; and (iii) that the
absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor.

Courtsupervised prebankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)

A financially distressed company may enter into a composition with its creditors, under court supervision,
in order to restructure its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a
declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings[4]. Only the company can file a
petition with the competent court for a concordato preventivo proceeding (together with, inter alia, a
restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal
and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for
_concordato preventivo is then published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the_
date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all
enforcement actions are automatically stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests
(unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on
which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective
against such preexisting creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it shall ensure
payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors
with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186bis of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors
and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into
shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of
the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into
classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes.

The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment
of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph
6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Law No.
98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial
statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of its creditors and the amount of their
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all the other relevant
documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing

4 Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has
had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years,
(ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and
(iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.


-----

of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, upon request
of the debtor, when there are reasonable grounds for such extension. Nevertheless, in response to the
Covid19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Decreto Liquidità, provides that the debtor company which has been
granted such extension by the court, can, before the deadline, request for a further extension up to
90 days, even if it has filed a petition for a declaration of bankruptcy. The request must describe the
elements that make the extension necessary, with specific reference to the events that have occurred as
a result of the Covid19 pandemic. The court, acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if
appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds.
The petition may be filed by the debtor who has been granted the hearing referred to in the Article 182bis,
paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Court in closed session, omitted the obligations provided
for in Article 182bis, Paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, grants the extension when considers
that the application is based on reasonable grounds and that the conditions for reaching a debt
restructuring agreement with the majorities referred to in the Article 182bis, paragraph 1, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law are satisfied. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the
approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If
the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario
_giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities_
under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report
one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall
report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the preliminary petition for a concordato
_preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned_
period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the
creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for
_concordato preventivo (socalled concordato in bianco)._

The debtor may not file such preliminary petition where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to
the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of
the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until
the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the
company’s financial position, which is published the following day in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the preliminary petition for the composition with
creditors being declared inadmissible, and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and
provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into
bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the
preparation of the proposal and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor
and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek
the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its nonrecurring activity, to the extent they are
urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new supersenior
indebtedness authorized by the court aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s
business, pending the concordato in bianco, as well as the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, or after
the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, are treated as supersenior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the clawback
action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the company’s business continues to be run by the
company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale).
In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that
are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the
financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also
certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a
greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented.


-----

Furthermore, the going concernbased arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the
windingup of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement
may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato)
to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and
calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues
to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial commissioners and
judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior judge’s
authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Thirdparty claims,
related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are supersenior (socalled prededucibili)
pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable
vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote, and also in the
event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The
_concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of_
the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even
via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term,
creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to have approved the concordato
_preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the notes in the concordato preventivo_
proceeding, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the indenture with respect to
meetings of holders of the notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in
meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they
waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the
fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which
case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also
approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected
to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the
dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an
objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the receivables giving the
right to vote or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting
class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the
relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato
_preventivo than would otherwise be the case._

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10%
of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a
prebankruptcy composition with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain
conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of
at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of prebankruptcy agreement
proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari) in case of prebankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going_
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a
prebankruptcy composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e.,
a prebankruptcy composition with creditors proposal aimed at transferring all the assets to the creditors
and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured
creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to prebankruptcy composition with creditors proposals based on the
continuation of the business (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may
grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate,
including taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in prebankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato


-----

_preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an_
offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the
court shall open a competitive bidding process.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the
public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the
company bankrupt.

Pursuant to article 169bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to
be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente
_eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g.,_
employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale
agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate
lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court
at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato),
if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending
agreements can also be suspended for a period not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such
circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages
suffered for the nonfulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid according to the
_concordato preventivo proposal._

Bankruptcy (fallimento)

A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
and the judicial liquidation of the debtor’s assets can be filed by the debtor itself, any of its creditors and,
in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs
when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due.
The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable
only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the
debtor (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of
the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of
€0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings:

(a) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may
enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims.
Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and
expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of
the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after
it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the
bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to
authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

(b) the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets pass from the debtor to the
bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare);

(c) any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments
made) is ineffective against the creditors;

(d) continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors; and

(e) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts
are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a courtappointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a


-----

representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor
for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in
accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of
time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/
2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements
applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is
shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors,
including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the
receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee
arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian
law (and, consequently, it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in
intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent
they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law).

Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare)

A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal
with creditors. The relevant proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, after the
declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are allowed to file such proposal only
after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to
the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of
_concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato fallimentare_
provides that they will not receive full satisfaction, in which case they can vote only in respect of the part
of their claim affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment
among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner.
The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors
holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the
claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

Statutory priorities

The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that
established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the
debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of
claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a
consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they
are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of
whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a
single asset.

Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated
according to the following order: (i) for payments of claims so called prededucibili (i.e., claims originated
within or in view of the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of
claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for payment of unsecured
creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are
paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired
(i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax authorities
and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are
those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not
exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and
unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari).

Avoidance powers in insolvency

Under Italian law, there are clawback or avoidance provisions that may affect, inter alia, the payments
made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance
provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions


-----

and transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally
considered to be favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other
jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a
clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the
context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the
clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a twoyear ineffectiveness
period for certain other transactions.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions that are ineffective by operation of
law and acts or transactions that are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner, as detailed below.

_(a) Acts ineffective by operation of law_

(1) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions entered into for no consideration
are ineffective visàvis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the twoyear period prior to the
bankruptcy declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to
Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of
law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without needing to wait
until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may
challenge the registration before the judge as a violation of law; and

(2) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the
declaration of bankruptcy or thereafter are deemed ineffective visàvis creditors if made by the
debtor in the twoyear period prior to the bankruptcy declaration.

_(b) Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner_

(1) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed back (revocati) visàvis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual
or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency:

(i) the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the bankruptcy declaration,
where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25%
the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by
other customary means of payment in the year preceding the bankruptcy declaration;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the bankruptcy
declaration in order to secure preexisting debts which have not yet fallen due; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the
bankruptcy declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due.

(2) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be
clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other
party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

(i) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions
entered into or made in the six months preceding the bankruptcy declaration; and

(ii) the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in
the six months preceding the bankruptcy declaration.

(3) The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

(i) a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt
towards the bank in a material and lasting manner;


-----

(iii) a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645bis of the Italian
Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property
that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within
three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of
the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity
have been carried out;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to
the bankrupt entity’s assets, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di
_risanamento attestato (see “—Outofcourt reorganization plans (piani di risanamento)_
_pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a
_concordato preventivo (see “—Courtsupervised prebankruptcy composition with creditors_
(concordato preventivo)” above) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under
Article 182bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt restructuring agreements with
_creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182bis of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law” above) and transactions entered into, payments made and security_
interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see above);

(vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and

(vii) a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with
respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt
entity be declared without effect visàvis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback
period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may
demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of
such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt
entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the
creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to
cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for
consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was
entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the
fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Article 2929bis of the Italian Civil Code provides for a “simplified” enforcement action for the creditors
with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract registered
assets from creditors’ action. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the
relevant assets without previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant
(fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out on a free basis (e.g.
gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the socalled fondo patrimoniale—
“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can be carried out by the creditor
also against the thirdparty purchaser.

Impacts of the Covid19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings

In response to the Covid19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, inter alia,
on insolvency matters in order to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the Covid19
pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis
before the Covid19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of certain insolvency proceedings
already pending during the Covid19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the Covid19
pandemic. Among such legislative measures, on April 8, 2020, the Italian Government enacted the
Decreto Liquidità, which provides businesses affected by the Covid19 pandemic with a package of
financial assistance designed to help Italian businesses survive the dramatic short term effects of the
Covid19 pandemic, and which has been converted into law on June 4, 2020.

The Decreto Liquidità (as amended, supplemented and replaced, as the case may be, from time to time)
contains measures to relieve enterprises from certain obligations or procedures that could trigger adverse
effects due to the Covid19 pandemic and the associated restrictions. Most of such measures were in


-----

place in the course of 2020 and do not apply anymore in 2021. However, some other measures are still
currently in place and shall therefore be considered.

One set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/preinsolvency
scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different
company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with
respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 and until the five subsequent
financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Decreto Liquidità, subsequently
replaced by Article 1, Paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020, is intended to address the
risk that the impact of losses arising from the Covid19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push
directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into
liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a
result of the delay in complying with such obligations.

An introduction to the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency

The Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency substantially reforms the Italian Bankruptcy Law by setting
out a unified and systematic set of rules for the implementation of an organic reform of the principles and
rules applicable to the effects of corporate crises and insolvency.

Certain provisions came into force on March 16, 2019 (e.g., provisions on Directors’ liability), certain
others should have entered into force from August 14, 2020. Due to the epidemiological emergency
relating to the Covid19 pandemic, Article 5 of the Decreto Liquidità postponed the entry into force of the
Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency to September 1, 2021. The Code of Business Crisis and
Insolvency will likely be further amended before its final entry into force (in that respect, please note that
with Ministerial Decree dated 22 April 2021, the Italian Minister of Justice (Ministro della Giustizia)
appointed a committee in charge of reviewing and propose amendments to the Code of Business Crisis
and Insolvency).

The main changes introduced by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency are (i) warning instruments
and assisted crisis resolution process; (ii) the introduction of the notion of insolvency of corporate groups;
(iii) amendments to the rules governing outofcourt reorganization plans (piani di risanamento),
courtsupervised prebankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), debt restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione) and the bankruptcy proceeding (now called liquidazione
_giudiziale) and (iv) renaming of the bankruptcy proceeding into judicial liquidation._

Warning instruments (strumenti di allerta) and assisted crisis resolution process (procedimento di
composizione assistita della crisi)

Warning instruments are a critical innovation set forth by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,
given that they do not affect companies only in time of crisis, but also during their whole life cycle. Such
warning instruments (strumenti di allerta), together with the organizational obligations imposed on the
debtor by the Civil Code (Article 2086 as amended by the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), aim
at promptly detecting signs of crisis in the debtor and at immediately adopting the measures best suited
to its composition. Specifically the corporate control bodies, the auditor and the auditing firm, each within
the scope of its functions, are obliged to: (i) verify that the administrative body constantly evaluates,
taking the appropriate initiatives, whether the organizational structure of the debtor is adequate; (ii) check
whether there is economic and financial equilibrium and what is the foreseeable trend of the
management; and (iii) immediately report to the Board of Directors the presence of wellfounded
indications of the existence of a crisis.

The report will be in writing and sent by certified electronic mail or, in any case, by means that ensure
proof of receipt, and will, additionally, contain the setting of a reasonable period, not exceeding 30 days,
within which the administrative body is to report on the solutions identified and the initiatives undertaken.
In case of omissions or inadequate responses, or failure to adopt, in the subsequent 60 days, the
measures deemed necessary to overcome the crisis, the aforementioned bodies will inform without delay
the Organismo di Composizione della Crisi di Impresa (“OCRI”), providing every element useful for its
determinations. Further obligations in monitoring companies and reporting to the OCRI rest upon the
Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate), the National Social Security Institute and the Collection Agent
(Agente per la Riscossione).

The OCRI is established at each Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Arts and Agriculture (CCIAA), with
the task of receiving the reports referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of the Code of Business Crisis and


-----

Insolvency, managing the alert procedure and assisting the debtor, at his request, in the procedure of
assisted composition of the crisis. The OCRI will work through the “contact person”, who will be the
SecretaryGeneral of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Crafts and Agriculture, or his delegate, as well
as through the contact person’s office, which may also be formed in an associated form by several
chambers of commerce and the expert council appointed from time to time.

Within 15 working days from the receipt of the report or from the debtor’s instance, the OCRI will summon
for a confidential hearing, before a council appointed specifically for the procedure, the debtor and, in the
case of a debtor with a supervisory body, the members of the supervisory body.

Pursuant to Article 18 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency when the OCRI detects the
existence of a crisis, it identifies with the debtor the possible measures to remedy it and sets the deadline
within which the debtor must report on their implementation.

In accordance with Article 19 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, at the request of the debtor,
the council will set a time limit for reaching an agreement with respect to the solution of the crisis. Such
time limit is set at 90 days, which may be extended for additional 90 days if negotiations are leading to a
solution to the crisis.

When the debtor applies for the approval of agreements to restructure debts or to open an arrangement
with creditors, the council proceeds, at the request of the debtor, to certify the truthfulness of the debtor’s
financial and economic data, including the list of the creditors. The arrangement produces the same
effects as the agreement that implements the outofcourt reorganization plan and, at the request of the
debtor and with the consent of the creditors concerned, is filed in the commercial register.

If, on expiry of the aforementioned period, no agreement has been reached with the creditors concerned
and a situation of crisis persists, the previously mentioned council will invite the debtor to apply for
access to one of the procedures described in the following paragraphs (i.e., accordi di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti, concordato preventivo and liquidazione giudiziale) within 30 days._

If the debtor fails to comply with the steps provided in the procedimento di composizione assistita della
crisi, the council, if it considers that the elements acquired make it clear that the debtor is in a state of
insolvency, will report this in a reasoned report to the contact person who will inform the public prosecutor
at the competent court thereof, who will, in turn, file for a judicial liquidation.

Outofcourt reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Code of Business
Crisis and Insolvency

Outofcourt debt restructuring agreements are still based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di
_risanamento) prepared by a company to restructure its indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of its_
financial condition. According to Article 56, an independent expert appointed by the debtor has to certify
to the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data
provided by the debtor.

The recovery plan must: (i) have a certified date; (ii) be in written form; (iii) have an analytical content with
the specification, aimed at avoiding opportunistic or collusive conduct, that even unilateral acts or
executive contracts must be proven in writing and must have a certified date. At the debtor’s request the
plan can be published in the companies’ register (this would allow for certain tax benefits).

The content of the plan will also indicate, pursuant to Article 56, Paragraph 2, of the Code of Business
Crisis and Insolvency: (i) the economic and financial situation of the debtor and indication of such debtor’s
asset; (ii) the main causes of the crisis; (iii) intervention strategies and the time needed to ensure the
rebalancing of the financial situation; (iv) the creditors and the amount of claims for which a renegotiation
is proposed and the status of each negotiation as well as the list of the creditors excluded from the plan
and the resources to be utilized by the debtor to repay such external creditors; (v) new financial
contributions; (vi) the timing of the actions to be carried out, which make it possible to verify their
implementation, as well as the instruments to be adopted in case of any deviation between the objectives
and the current situation; and (vii) a business plan and evidence of its effects on the financial aspect of
the debtor.

The terms and conditions of these plans are still freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike courtsupervised
prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors and debt restructuring agreements, outofcourt


-----

reorganization plans, pursuant to Article 56 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, do not offer
the debtor any protection from enforcement proceedings or precautionary actions of thirdparty creditors.
Should these plans fail and the debtor subsequently be subject to judicial insolvency, Italian insolvency
laws provide that, subject to certain conditions, the payments or acts carried out to implement the
reorganization plan are not subject to clawback action (Article 166, Paragraph 3(d), of the Code of
Business Crisis and Insolvency) and are exempt from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions.

Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57
of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency

Outofcourt agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors representing at
least 60% of the debtor’s outstanding debts have not particularly changed with the introduction of the
Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. They still have to be sanctioned by the court and an independent
expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data
provided by the debtor. Moreover, such expert must also declare that the agreement is feasible and
ensure that the debts of nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within 120 days from: (i) the date
when the court sanctions the agreement, in the case of debts which are already due and payable to
nonparticipating creditors as of that date; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts is due, in case of
receivables which are not yet due and payable to nonparticipating creditors as of the date the court
sanctions the debt restructuring agreement (omologazione). Only a debtor who is in a state of crisis (i.e.,
facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) or insolvent can initiate this process
and request the court to sanction the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors
(omologazione).

If the debtor has so requested in the application referred to in Article 40 of the Code of Business Crisis
and Insolvency, from the date of its publication in the relevant companies’ register, creditors by reason of
previous preceding title or cause cannot, under penalty of voidance, begin or continue executive and
precautionary actions on the debtor’s assets. From the same date, the statute of limitations remains
suspended and the forfeitures (decadenze) do not occur. These protective measures may be required by
the debtor also during the negotiations and before the filing of the application for the sanction of the debt
restructuring agreements, by including the documentation referred to in Article 39 and the proposal for
an agreement accompanied by a statement from the independent expert certifying that the proposal is in
progress with creditors representing at least 60% of the total and that it, if accepted, is eligible for ensuring
the full payment of creditors with whom they are not in negotiations or have otherwise denied their own
willingness to negotiate.

The percentage referred to in Article 57 (60% of the debtor’s outstanding debt) will be reduced by half
when the debtor: (i) does not propose a moratorium on creditors who are not parties to the agreements;
and (ii) has not requested, and refrains from requesting, protective measures.

Aside from an indication of the elements of the business plan which enable it to be implemented, the
Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency does not include express provisions concerning the contents of
a debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either that the debtor or a third
party continue the business or that the business be sold to a third party, and may contain refinancing
agreements, moratoria, writeoffs or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for partial or deferred payment of certain taxes, pursuant to
Article 63 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency. Creditors and other interested parties may
oppose the agreement within 30 days from its publication in the companies’ register. The court will, after
having settled any oppositions, sanction the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed
(soggetta a reclamo), in accordance with Article 51 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, within
30 days of its publication.

Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, debtors are entitled to enter into
debt restructuring agreements by obtaining approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits
belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic
interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on dissenting creditors of the
same category (a socalled “cramdown”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that
dissenting creditors are not treated worse than under any other available alternative. The law also
mandates that (i) the agreement will be of a nonliquidating nature, (ii) the agreement will provide for the
continuation of the business activity directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84, Paragraph 2, of the Code
of Business Crisis and Insolvency, and (iii) that creditors are satisfied to a significant extent or mainly
from the proceeds of the continuation of the going concern. If these conditions are met, the remaining


-----

25% of nonparticipating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down;
however, crammeddown creditors can challenge the agreement and refuse to be forced into it.

A special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total
indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of
such creditors who have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend its effect to
nonparticipating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid
even if the creditors’ satisfaction does not come from the proceeds of the going concern.

Similarly, pursuant to Article 62 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, a standstill agreement
(convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same
class would also bind nonparticipating creditors, provided that an independent expert certifies the
homogeneity of the classes and that certain further conditions are met (e.g., there has to be a real
prospect that creditors in the same category who are not part of the agreement, but to whom the effects
of the agreement are extended, will be satisfied at the end of the agreement to no lesser extent than in
the case of judicial liquidation).

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Articles 61 and 62 of the Code of Business
Crisis and Insolvency may impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, and the
maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on third party
creditors.

Pursuant to Article 101 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, financing granted to the debtor
pursuant to an approved debt restructuring agreement (or a courtsupervised prejudicial liquidation
composition with creditors) enjoy priority status in a subsequent judicial liquidation (such status also
applies to shareholder financing, but only up to 80% of such financing). In the event of the debtor’s
subsequent admission to judicial liquidation, such financing does not benefit of the priority status where
the composition with creditors proceeding or the debt restructuring agreement is, on the basis of an
assessment to be made at the time of filing, based on false data or omission of relevant information or
the debtor has carried out acts in fraud of creditors and the receiver (curatore) proves that those who
granted the financing, at the date of disbursement, knew such circumstances.

Pursuant to Articles 99 and 100 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the court, after the
petition for a courtsupervised prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) or
for a debt restructuring agreement, may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur into new supersenior (socalled
_prededucibile) indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and certification by an independent_
expert that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; (ii) secure such indebtedness
via in rem securities (garanzie reali), provided that the independent expert appointed by the debtor,
having verified the overall financial needs of the debtor until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares
that the new financial indebtedness aims to achieve better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts
deriving from the supply of services or goods already payable and due at the date of the petition, provided
that the independent expert declares that such payment is essential to maintain the debtor’s activities
and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 99, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the
court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new supersenior (socalled prededucibile) indebtedness,
aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the debtor’s business. In this case, the certification
of the independent expert is not necessary. Pursuant to Article 99, Paragraph 2, of the Code of Business
Crisis and Insolvency, t he debtor, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify: (i) the
purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds; and (iii) that the
absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the debtor.

Courtsupervised prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount
to insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, to
compose its overall indebtedness or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency.
Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following
thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for
each of the three preceding financial years, (ii) has had revenues (in whatever way they are found to be)
in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding financial years, and
(iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can initially file a petition with the


-----

court for a concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, a restructuring plan and an independent expert
report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and
accounting data provided by the debtor). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the
debtor in the companies’ register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court
sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose
debt became due before the publication of the concordato preventivo petition in the companies’ register)
are stayed, if the debtor has made such a request with the petition. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding
the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are
ineffective against such preexisting creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring of
debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (including through non-recurring transactions, such as the
granting of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and
debt securities to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies); (ii) the transfer to a receiver
(assuntore) of the operations of the debtor making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors
into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (the socalled concordato in bianco), because the debtor, pursuant to
Article 44, Paragraph 1(a) of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, may ask the court to set a
period between 30 and 60 days, which may be extended upon request of the debtor in the presence of
justified reasons and in the absence of requests for the opening of judicial liquidation, by no more than
60 days, within which the debtor submits the proposal for a composition with creditors with the plan, the
attestation of truthfulness of the data and feasibility of the plan and the documentation referred to in
Article 39, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, or a debt restructuring
agreement.

If the court accepts such petition, it may appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to
overview the debtor, who will report to the court any act of fraud committed against creditors (as described
in Article 106 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), or any circumstance or conduct of the
debtor which could jeopardize the effective solution of the crisis, which, upon further verification, may
reject the petition for a concordato preventivo. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the
necessary documentation also contains the periodical information requirements (relating to (i) the
financial management of the debtor, (ii) the activities carried out for the purposes of filing the composition
proposal and the restructuring plan) that the debtor has to fulfil, under the supervision of the judicial
commissioner, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor
will also file, on a monthly basis, a document relating to the debtor’s financial position, which is published,
within the following day, in the companies’ register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the
relevant requirements are verified, a judicial liquidation proceeding will be opened.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the debtor may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to nonrecurring activities to the extent they are urgent. Claims
arising from acts lawfully carried out by the debtor during the insolvency procedures and new supersenior
indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement and court supervised prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors, are treated as
supersenior (socalled prededucibili) and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are
exempt from clawback pursuant to Article 166 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency.

The composition proposal may, in accordance with Article 87 of the Code of Business Crisis and
Insolvency, provide for: (i) the debtor’s business to continue to be run by the debtor as a going concern;
or (ii) the business to be transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer
necessary to run the business be liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the
petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a
consequence of continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary.

The independent experts must also certify that continuing the business is conducive to satisfying
creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented.


-----

The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for partial or deferred payment
of certain taxes pursuant to Article 88 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge to supervise the
procedure (giudice delegato) and one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali), and calls a
creditors’ vote. While the proposal is implemented, the debtor generally continues to be managed by its
board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who must authorize all
transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business).

The concordato preventivo may be voted telematically and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote, and, (b) in the event that
the plan provides for more classes of creditors, the majority of such classes. Secured creditors are not
entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their
security or if the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair
market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which
case they can vote only with respect to the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also
approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding one or more classes’ objection to it) if: (i) the majority
of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of dissenting creditors are
adequately safeguarded compared to other solutions. If 20% of the creditors entitled to vote or, in case
there are different classes of creditors, a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, file an objection
(opposizione) to the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo, the court may nevertheless sanction the
_concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater_
extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

Pursuant to Article 90 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, it is possible for creditors (except
for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least
10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan in prejudicial liquidation
composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in
particular, that the debtor’s proposal does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 30% of the unsecured claims
(crediti chirografari) or (ii) 20% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) where the debtor has
requested the opening of the alert procedure or has usefully initiated an assisted crisis resolution, in
accordance with Article 24 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency.

In addition, to strengthen the position of unsecured creditors, the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency
provides that a concordato liquidatorio (i.e., a prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors aiming to
transfer all assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial
commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid with respect to at least 20% of their
claims and increase their satisfaction by at least 10% in comparison with the alternative of the judicial
liquidation. This provision does not apply to prejudicial liquidation composition with creditors based on
the continuation of business (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may
grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate,
for instance by taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 91 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency provides that if a plan in prejudicial
liquidation composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) includes an offer to sell the debtor’s assets
or a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request the
court to open a competitive bidding process to the extent it is in the best interest of the creditors. After
approval by the creditors, the court, having settled any objections raised by dissenting creditors, sanctions
the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

If the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the delegated judge will immediately report to
the court, which will subsequently, upon request of those who an entitled entity and if all the requirements
are met, open the judicial liquidation pursuant to Article 49 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency.

Pursuant to Article 97 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the debtor may request the
competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements, except for certain agreements
which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements, residential real
estate preliminary sale agreements and real estate lease agreements), if they are not coherent with the
plan’s prosecution or not functional to its execution. Upon the debtor’s request, pending agreements can
also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable only once. In such
circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages


-----

suffered for the nonfulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid according to the
_concordato preventivo proposal._

Judicial liquidation

Under the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the term “bankruptcy” has been replaced with the
term “judicial liquidation”; however, its scope and objectives have not changed. A request to commence
this proceeding to liquidate the debtor’s assets may be filed, in accordance with Article 37 of the Code of
Business Crisis and Insolvency, by (i) the debtor itself, (ii) any of its creditors, (iii) the public prosecutor (in
accordance with Article 38 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), or (iv) the administrative
bodies and authorities responsible for the control and supervision of the debtor.

Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, occurs when a
debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Judicial
liquidation is declared by the competent court within each tribunal. Italian insolvency law is applicable
only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if one of the following thresholds is met: the
debtor (i) had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million during each of
the three preceding financial years; (ii) had gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount
exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding financial years; or (iii) has total indebtedness in
excess of €0.5 million.

On the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings:

(a) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may
enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims.
Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interests and
expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of
the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it
has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the
receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the
sale and sets forth the timing in its decision;

(b) a receiver (curatore) is appointed to administer the debtor and manage its assets;

(c) any act of the debtor done after a declaration of judicial liquidation (including payments made)
is ineffective against the creditors;

(d) continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the debtor, but only if continuation of the debtor’s business does not cause damage
to creditors; and

(e) the execution of certain contracts or transactions pending as of the date of declaration of judicial
liquidation is suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some
or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject
to specific rules under the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency.

Judicial liquidation proceedings are carried out and supervised by a courtappointed receiver, a deputy
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The receiver is not a representative of any one of the
creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the
creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory
priority rights. Liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where
the debtor’s assets include real estate. The applicable law provides for a priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the proceeding and costs related to
the receiver’s running of the debtor, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee
arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is granted under mandatory provisions of Italian law
(and, consequently, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly
provided in intercreditor agreements would be recognized by an Italian judicial liquidation’s estate, to the
extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law).

Composition with creditors during the judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)

A judicial liquidation proceeding can terminate prior to the decree giving effect to the liabilities account
(stato passivo) effective through a composition proposal with creditors. The relevant proposal can be


-----

filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, after the declaration of judicial liquidation. By contrast, the
debtor or its subsidiaries are only allowed to file such proposal after one year from such declaration, but
within two years following the decree giving effect to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Additionally,
the debtor’s proposal is only admissible if it provides for the contribution of resources that increase the
value of the assets by at least 10%.

Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale,
unless and to the extent they waive their entire or part of their security, or the concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only with
respect to the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment
among the classes), the restructuring of debts and satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. An
abstention is considered as a favorable vote. The concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale proposal must
be approved by the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by
a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court sanctioning is also required.

Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi
imprese in stato di insolvenza)

An extraordinary administration proceeding applies under Italian law to large industrial and commercial
enterprises (the Prodibis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious
recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200
employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least twothirds of its assets as
shown in its financial statements and twothirds of its income from sales and services during its last
financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to
commence an extraordinary administration proceeding. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary
administration proceedings.

The extraordinary administration proceeding is divided into two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an
“administrative phase”.

Judicial phase

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether
it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers
(commissiario giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a
business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and
within 10 days from such filing, the Ministry of the Economic Development (the “Ministry”) may release
an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration proceeding. The court
then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure
or to place it into bankruptcy.

Administrative phase

Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration proceeding, the administrative
phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The
extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as
a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a
reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless
extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with
creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the
company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within
30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition
and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing
which the company is declared bankrupt.


-----

Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in
stato di insolvenza)

Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the Marzano
procedure. It is complementary to the Prodibis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodibis procedure. For
example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the
filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at
least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt.
The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s
request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses
whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit
a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan
must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal
or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open
bankruptcy proceedings.

Compulsory administrative windingup (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)

A compulsory administrative windingup (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain
companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as statecontrolled companies, insurance
companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to
bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private
sector. A compulsory administrative windingup is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the
entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees
the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the
relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in
respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious
violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is
that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind
up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di
_sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other_
insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The
effect on creditors of the forced administrative windingup is largely the same as under bankruptcy
proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for
bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to
extraordinary administration proceedings.

Interim financing

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit
lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a
Prebankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with super-senior status (prededucibilità) in case of
subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the
relevant court, upon, inter alia, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed
and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The
court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the
judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a PreBankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing was functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing
was provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such
priority status.


-----

Under Article 99 of the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency, the petition must: (i) specify the use of
the financing; (ii) state that the debtor is not able to find financing otherwise; and (iii) indicate the reasons
why the absence of the financing would lead to a serious prejudice to the debtor’s activities or the
continuation of the procedure. The petition must be accompanied by a report from an independent
professional certifying that all the requirements set forth in Article 99 are met, as well as that the financing
should result in the better satisfaction of the creditors’ claims. The report is not necessary when the court
finds that there is an urgent need to take steps to avoid serious and irreparable damage to the debtor’s
business.

Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to one year
(six months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request
that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary
clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the collateral and
any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance
or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the noninsolvency avoidance or clawback
of transactions by the debtor made during the suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions
made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below
market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the
value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment
in kind) or new security granted with respect to preexisting debts not yet due at the time the security is
entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the noninsolvent creditor proves that it
had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security
granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to preexisting debts due and
payable, unless the noninsolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at
the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions
at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the
suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves
that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to
avoidance also include those contemplated by a notes guarantee or the granting of security interests
under the security documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully,
the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant security
documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent
estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited
exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective visàvis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the twoyear period prior to the insolvency declaration, and
(ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective visàvis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the
twoyear period prior to insolvency.

_Certain Considerations in Relation to Guarantees and Security Interests_

Maximum Guaranteed Amount

Under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued by an Italian guarantor to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such
maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the deed
of guarantee or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned
below, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit: in other
words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee deed and should be
proportionate to the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantors. It is uncertain, however,
whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determinations.


-----

In order to comply with Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code and corporate law requirements on, inter alia,
corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that an Italian guarantor may be required
to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under Indenture will be subject to limitations.

If and to the extent any Italian subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code
is legally permitted to and does guarantee the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, the
Notes and any related documents (the “Debt Documents”), the relevant deed of guarantee or the
Indenture shall contain limitations on the relevant Italian guarantor liability to the extent reasonably
necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance (and, in particular, the
guarantee provided by Italian guarantor shall exclude any portion of the debt that relates to the refinancing
of debt that was used to finance the (direct or indirect) acquisition of the corporate capital of such Italian
guarantors), corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable Italian law.

Creating guarantees of restricted financial activity

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively allowed to
banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Noncompliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking
Act may, inter alia, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Decree
No. 53 of April 2, 2015 issued by the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs and Finance (Ministero
_dell’Economia e delle Finanze), implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states_
that the issuance of guarantees by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the
same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling,
controlled and associated companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well
as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the abovedescribed rules,
subject to the guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same groups, the provision of the
guarantees would not qualify as a restricted financial activity.

Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Issues under Italian Law

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable
laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit,
corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a
guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing,
restructuring or recapitalisation, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must
receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided
by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation
and it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is
purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate
benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis, although upon
certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company
belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream security or
guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure or guarantee (as applicable) financial obligations
of directly or indirectly subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually selfevident, the validity and
effectiveness of upstream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to
secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor)
granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate
benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be
proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or
security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not
be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of an upstream
and crossstream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may
include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group (without duplication), while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions


-----

to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to
whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and
conflict of interest.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting
a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected
by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors
may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors
of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts
carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions
of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those
companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received
an advantage or profit from such improper control (including as a result of creation of guarantee or
security lacking adequate corporate benefit). Moreover, the security interest or guarantee granted by an
Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed
to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian
company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream, cross-stream and downstream
guarantees and security interests granted by Italian companies.

**_Financial Assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability
which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the
case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for
a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to
support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity
that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness
originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or
indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee
or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be
personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

**_Certain considerations in relation to security interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In
this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any
entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in
the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata)
will be subject to the so-called “equitable subordination” and therefore will be subordinated to all other
creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when,
taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the
borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation
requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower
with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be
returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars
generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial
support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above.
Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies
incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that
are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts
may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries
under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of
any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other
creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed


-----

subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity,
the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the
Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment
obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans
or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any
collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests
granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Italian government issued the so-called “Decreto Liquidità”
(i.e., Law Decree April 8, 2020, no. 23, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted
into law by the Italian parliament by Law June 5, 2020, no. 40, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on
June 6, 2020, the “Liquidity Decree”) according to which the provisions summarized above are
temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any
entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in
the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata)
during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of
the so-called “equitable subordination” rule.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially
in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary
goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for
the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses
as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness
or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance
or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
period”).

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply
and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the
holders of Notes could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general
may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

   - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors;

   - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

   - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer
to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

  - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze)
or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;


-----

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary
obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a
matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that
such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application
of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto or frode alla legge);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the
Italian Civil Code are satisfied as described above;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such
interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis as described above;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the
proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors
cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security
interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets
is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the
absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)
and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal
interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure
proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment
to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable
date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of
ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the
relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of
witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented
by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the
violation of mandatory provisions;


-----

  - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

  - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among
others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest
rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as
amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of
interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including
Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be
capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest
were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after
the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the
Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable;

  - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the
other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such
other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

   - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

   - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge;
and

  - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by
the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy
proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of
the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to
the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action
can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters
into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order
to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code
(which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security,
agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An
Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the
ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

   - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

   - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and,
if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated
in the fraudulent design.

**Mexico**

**_Guarantees_**

Two of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Mexico. Under Mexican law, there are no
limitations for Mexican companies to guarantee thirdparty obligations, including parents, subsidiaries or
affiliates, to the extent expressly permitted by its corporate bylaws and authorized by its competent
corporate bodies if necessary pursuant to its corporate bylaws.

**_Security Interest_**

At a minimum, security interests require a written agreement for perfection. In some cases, security
interests require formalization in a public instrument issued by a Mexican notary public or public attestor.
Also, in many cases, the documents evidencing the security interests are required to be recorded in a
private ledger or public registry in order to obtain priority visàvis third parties.


-----

**_Pledge_**

A pledge creates a lien on personal property, including account receivables and shares. Federal law
regulates pledges granted for commercial purposes. Commercial law provides generally for two types of
pledges: possessory, when the pledged asset is physically delivered to the pledgee or a person appointed
by the parties as agent of the pledgee, and nonpossessory (prenda sin transmisión de posesión), when
the possession of the pledged asset remains with the pledgor.

In the case of a possessory pledge, generally the pledge is perfected by delivery of the asset to the
pledgee or to a third party appointed by the parties as agent of the pledgee. Also, depending on the
nature of the pledged asset, notice to third parties may be required, as in the case of accounts receivables
(notice to the account borrower). Further formalities may be required in the case of negotiable
instruments, which may require the endorsement of the share certificate and its physical deliver in favor
of the pledgee and its annotation in the share registry book of the issuer entity of the shares. A pledgee
in a possessory pledge has the right, in case of default, to request the court to sell the assets and apply
the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the secured obligations up to the outstanding amount of the
latter.

**_Foreclosure_**

Court intervention is required in order to foreclose most security interests afforded by Mexican law.

**_Insolvency_**

The Mexican Insolvency Law (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles) contemplates a single proceeding for
insolvency (concurso mercantil) and bankruptcy (quiebra) with two successive stages: the first stage,
known as the “mediation” stage, is compulsory (except in the event in which the insolvent entity directly
requests to be declared bankrupt), and is designed to reorganize the insolvent entity, and the second
stage, known as the “bankruptcy” stage, provides for the bankruptcy and liquidation of the insolvent
entity. During these two phases, the creditors have to comply with different obligations to reach, either a
payment agreement, or foreclose on their collateral.

_General requirements to initiate insolvency proceedings_

In Mexico, a person will be declared insolvent when it generally fails to pay its obligations as and when
they become due. Insolvency of a person will be adjudicated upon the request of the insolvent entity, the
Mexican attorney general’s office or any creditor of the insolvent entity when, (a) the insolvent entity has
defaulted on its payment obligations with two or more creditors and (b) when, on the date of such request,
(i) 35% or more of such obligations have been delinquent for more than 30 days; and/or (ii) the insolvent
entity does not have sufficient liquid assets (namely, cash and cash equivalents, such as bank deposits
and other receivables with a maturity of no more than 90 days, or securities that may be sold within
30 days, in each case, from the date of filing of the insolvency request) to pay at least 80% of its due and
payable obligations on the date of filing of the insolvency request.

If the insolvency request is filed voluntarily by the insolvent entity, only one of the conditions described in
items (i) and (ii) of clause (b) above would have to be satisfied. If the insolvency request is filed by the
Mexican attorney general’s office or any creditor of the insolvent entity, both conditions described in items
(i) and (ii) of clause (b) above would have to be satisfied. An insolvency presumption will exist with
respect to any person or entity when, inter alia, its assets for attachment in aid of execution of a judgment
or claim are insufficient; it has failed to pay two or more creditors; or it has participated in fraudulent or
fictitious acts to avoid payment to creditors.

Upon the filing of a petition for a judgment declaring insolvency, the court will instruct the Federal Institute
of Insolvency Specialists (Instituto Federal de Especialistas de Concursos Mercantiles) to appoint an
inspector (visitador) to visit the entity presumed to be insolvent. The inspector will then issue an opinion
regarding the commercial entity’s insolvency, which will enable the court to issue a judicial resolution
declaring the legal insolvency of such person. Following the issuance of such insolvency judgment, the
Federal Institute of Insolvency Specialists will designate and appoint a mediator (conciliador) who will
facilitate the negotiations between the insolvent entity and its creditors in order to reach a creditors’
agreement.


-----

_“Mediation” Stage_

The issuance of the insolvency judgment and the appointment of the mediator will initiate the “mediation”
stage of the insolvency proceeding. The insolvency proceeding in Mexico is at all times court controlled
and, upon receipt of an insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures
(providencias precautorias) to secure the property of the insolvent entity.

During the “mediation” stage, the insolvent entity and those creditors that have been recognized within
the insolvency proceeding as creditors of the insolvent entity would negotiate an agreement with respect
to the payment of the outstanding obligations of the insolvent entity. In order for such creditors’ agreement
to become effective and binding, it must be entered into between the insolvent entity and those recognized
creditors holding title to more than 50% of the sum of (i) the amount of all unsecured claims of all
unsecured recognized creditors of the insolvent entity, and (ii) the amount of all secured claims of those
secured recognized creditors that enter into such creditors’ agreement. The creditors’ agreement would
then have to be approved by the insolvency court. A secured claim under the Mexican insolvency law is
considered to be a claim secured under a pledge or a mortgage or otherwise benefiting from any other
form of statutory privilege or priority of payment.

For purposes of determining whether the creditors’ agreement meets the above-mentioned required
majority of creditors, under the Mexican insolvency statute, such agreement would be deemed entered
into by an unsecured recognized creditor (whether or not such creditor actually enters into the agreement)
if the agreement expressly contemplates (a) the payment of all amounts due and payable to such creditor
on the date of the respective insolvency judgment converted into unidades de inversión (“UDIs”), which
are indexed inflation units, at the applicable official rate fixed by the Mexican Central Bank (Banco de
_México) on the date on which the conversion takes place, (b) the payment of all amounts that would_
become due and payable to such creditor from the date of the insolvency judgment until the date of
approval of the creditors’ agreement by the insolvency court, which would be converted into UDIs on the
date such amounts become due and payable and (c) the payment of all amounts that would become due
and payable to such creditor after the date of approval of the creditors’ agreement.

The creditors’ agreement could also provide, with respect to any unsecured recognized creditors that are
not a party to such agreement, (i) a stay of such creditors’ claim (with capitalization of ordinary interest),
but only to the extent that the term of such stay is at least equal to the shortest stay assumed by those
unsecured creditors that are a party to the creditors’ agreement and whose claims amount to 30% of all
aggregate recognized claims; (ii) a writeoff of such creditors’ claim, but only to the extent such writeoff is
at least equal to the lowest writeoff assumed by those unsecured creditors that are a party to the creditors’
agreement whose claims amount to 30% of all aggregate recognized claims; or (iii) a combination of a
stay and a writeoff of such creditors’ claim, to the extent it is identical to the combinations accepted by
those unsecured creditors that are a party to the creditors’ agreement whose claims amount to 30% of all
aggregate recognized claims.

Creditors’ agreements that meet such creditor-majority and content requirements (among others) would
be approved by the court and bind all unsecured creditors, regardless of whether they executed the
agreement or not. On the contrary, secured recognized creditors that do not become a party to the
creditors’ agreements will not be bound by them and may commence or continue foreclosure of their
respective collateral, unless the creditors’ agreement contemplates the payment of their respective claims
or the payment of the price of the properties constituting such collateral. In this case, any excess with
respect to the value of such properties would be deemed an unsecured claim for purposes of the
insolvency proceeding.

_“Bankruptcy” Stage_

The insolvency court will declare the borrower in bankruptcy if (i) the “mediation” phase expires without
the filing of an approved creditors’ agreement before the insolvency court within up to a year since the
beginning of the “mediation” stage, (ii) if requested by the insolvent entity, or (iii) at the request of the
mediator. The purpose of the bankruptcy phase is to liquidate the borrower’s assets in order to pay the
creditors.

Upon such declaration of bankruptcy, the insolvency court will instruct the Mexican Federal Institute of
Insolvency Specialists (Instituto Federal de Especialistas de Concursos Mercantiles) to appoint a receiver
(síndico) who would be charged with the management of the insolvent entity until its liquidation. The
receiver would carry out the liquidation of the insolvent entity through the sale of its assets, in accordance
with certain preset rules and conditions.


-----

Bankruptcy proceedings shall be terminated by the court if (i) all the assets of the borrower have been
sold, (ii) all creditors have been paid in full, or (iii) the insufficiency of the borrower’s assets to pay all
creditors has been proved.

_Effects of Bankruptcy on Transactions_

Under Mexican law, the guarantee under the Indenture provides a basis for a direct claim against each
Mexican Guarantor; however, it is possible that such guarantee may not be enforceable under Mexican
insolvency law. While Mexican law does not prohibit the giving of guarantees and as a result does not
prevent the Guarantee of the Notes from being valid, binding and enforceable against the Mexican
Guarantors, in the event that any of the Mexican Guarantors becomes subject to an insolvency
proceeding, the guarantee may be deemed to have been a fraudulent transfer and declared void. Certain
transactions, including transactions with related parties, are presumed to be fraudulent conveyances
_(actos en fraude de acreedores), unless the interested third party can prove that it acted in good faith._
Under the Mexican insolvency law, any act consummated by a Mexican Guarantor prior to the date of an
insolvency judgment will be deemed fraudulent when the Mexican Guarantor is knowingly defrauding its
creditors, and the third party participating in any such action had actual knowledge of such fraudulent
intent. If the action is gratuitous, the action will be deemed fraudulent even if the third party had no actual
knowledge of the fraudulent intent.

Under the applicable provisions of the Mexican Insolvency Law, transactions occurring within a period
_(periodo de retroaction), which generally comprises the nine months (270 calendar days) immediately_
prior to the date of the declaration of insolvency (concurso mercantil), but which can be extended up to
three years or reduced by the court pursuant to its sole discretion, may be subject to challenge on the
grounds of fraudulent conveyance. Any action consummated by the Mexican Guarantor at any time after
the date that is 270 calendar days (as the same may be extended) prior to the date of the applicable
insolvency judgment (i) will be deemed fraudulent when, inter alia, (a) the Mexican Guarantor receives no
consideration, or the consideration received or paid by the Mexican Guarantor, or the terms and conditions
of the transaction, are clearly or materially below market, or (b) the Mexican Guarantor makes a payment
of indebtedness not yet due, or forgives receivables owed to it, and (ii) will be presumed fraudulent,
unless the interested third party proves that it was acting in good faith, when (a) the Mexican Guarantor
grants or increases collateral that was not originally contemplated and (b) the Mexican Guarantor makes
any payments in kind that were not originally contemplated. In addition, certain transactions among
related parties will also be deemed fraudulent and may be set aside by the insolvency court.

In addition, the mediator may order the borrower to abstain from performing agreements which have not
been performed by the borrower at the time of the declaration of insolvency, if the mediator considers
that performance of such agreement would adversely affect the borrower’s estate, case in which the
agreement shall be rescinded.

The Mexican Insolvency Law also provides that all Mexican peso denominated unsecured obligations be
converted into UDIs, and foreign currency denominated unsecured obligations are to be converted to
Mexican pesos at the prevailing exchange rate in Mexico and published by the Mexican Central Bank
(Banco de México) on the date the insolvency judgment is rendered, and then converted into UDIs. With
this mechanism, although recognized unsecured creditors will not be entitled to collect interest during the
insolvency proceedings, the fact that the obligations will be denominated in UDIs, protects the value of
the debts from a loss of value resulting from inflation.

Those creditors with a perfected security interest (mortgage or pledge) will not suffer any currency or unit
conversion, and their debts will continue to accrue interest at the contractual (not default of penalty)
interest rate, up to the amount of the value of the mortgaged or pledged assets. Any amount not covered
by the value of the collateral will be converted into UDIs and subject to the general rules of the Mexican
Insolvency Law.

Therefore, upon issuance of an insolvency judgment (concurso mercantil) or bankruptcy (quiebra)
declaration against any of the Mexican Guarantors, the obligations of the applicable Mexican Guarantor
under the Notes (i) would be converted into Mexican pesos at the exchange rate prevailing in Mexico and
published by the Mexican Central Bank (Banco de México) at the time of the insolvency judgment and
then from Mexican pesos into UDIs, and would not be adjusted to take into account any devaluation of
the Mexican peso relative to any foreign legal currency occurring after such conversion; (ii) would be
subject to the outcome of, and priorities recognized in, the Mexican Insolvency Law; (iii) would cease to


-----

accrue interest from the date an insolvency proceeding is declared; and (iv) would be subject to certain
statutory preferences, including tax, social security and labor claims and claims of secured creditors.

_Ranking of creditors_

Recognized claims against a bankruptcy estate are classified in categories, according to the nature of
their claims. The proceeds obtained from the liquidation of the assets of the insolvent entity would be
applied by the receiver to make payments to creditors in the following order of priority:

(a) Claims against the bankruptcy estate, which are (i) payments of labor claims for salaries and
severance for the two calendar years preceding the insolvency judgment (concurso mercantil)
or bankruptcy (quiebra); (ii) payments of liabilities and obligations of the estate of the insolvent
entity (i.e., management costs, fees and expenses incurred after the insolvency judgment); and
(iii) payments of litigation costs and expenses, and fees and expenses of the inspector
(visitador), the mediator (conciliador) and any appointed receivers (síndico);

(b) Mortgagee’s and pledgee’s claims, which are payments to secured creditors (including the costs
and expenses relating to foreclosure and the enforcement of their respective rights), but only to
the extent of the value of their respective collateral;

(c) Common labor credits and tax credits different to the ones referred in paragraph (a)(i) above
which shall be paid once the creditors referred in paragraphs (a) and (b) above are satisfied and
with priority to the special privileged creditors provided in paragraph (d) hereafter and common
creditors;

(d) Special privileged claims, which are payments to other creditors that qualify as “privileged”
under Mexican commercial laws (e.g., creditors that are entitled to retain an asset until payment
is made), but only to the extent of the value of the respective privilege;

(e) Common claims, which are payments to unsecured creditors; and

(f) _Subordinated claims, which are those of creditors who have agreed to be subordinated with_
respect to the common claims or who are related parties of the insolvent entity.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Under Mexican law, there is no limitation with respect to the amount of the secured obligations nor the
corporate benefit received by the Mexican Guarantors. However, the grant of a guarantee or collateral by
the Mexican Guarantors must fall within the grantor’s corporate purpose and it must be authorized by its
competent corporate bodies if necessary pursuant to its corporate by laws, to the extent that, in case it is
not expressly allowed and authorized, if the latter is necessary, there is the risk that the grant of the
guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable.

No treaty is currently in effect between the United States and Mexico that covers the reciprocal
enforcement of judgments issued in the other country. Generally, Mexican courts would enforce final
judgments rendered in the United States if, among other things:

(a) such judgment is obtained in compliance with legal requirements of the jurisdiction of the court
rendering such judgment;

(b) all formalities set forth in treaties relating to foreign rogatory letters, to which Mexico is a party,
have been complied with;

(c) such judgment is not rendered in a real action (acción real);

(d) the court was competent to resolve the relevant matter in accordance with the rules of
international law compatible with those adopted by the Mexican Commerce Code (Código de
_Comercio);_

(e) service of process was made personally on the applicable party or on an appropriate process
agent thereof;

(f) such judgment is final in the jurisdiction where obtained and there is no recourse against it;


-----

(g) such judgment and the obligation enforced through such judgment do not contravene Mexican
public policy or laws;

(h) the action in respect to which such judgment is rendered is not the subject matter of a lawsuit
among the same parties pending before a Mexican court;

(i) the applicable procedure under the laws of Mexico with respect to the enforcement of foreign
judgments (including the issuance of a letter rogatory by the competent authority of such
jurisdiction requesting enforcement of such judgment and the certification of such judgment as
authentic by the corresponding authorities of such jurisdiction in accordance with the laws
thereof) is complied with; and

(j) the courts of such jurisdiction recognize the principles of reciprocity in connection with the
enforcement of foreign judgments in such jurisdiction.

Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability, in original actions in Mexican courts, of liabilities
predicated, in whole or in part, on U.S. federal securities laws and as to the enforceability in Mexican
courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S.
federal securities laws.

In the event that proceedings are brought in Mexico seeking enforcement of the Mexican Guarantors’
obligations in Mexico, pursuant to article 8 of the Mexican Monetary Law (Ley Montetaria de los Estados
_Unidos Mexicanos); the Mexican Guarantors may discharge their obligations by paying any sums due in_
a foreign currency, in Mexican pesos at the exchange rate for Mexican pesos applicable on the date on
which payment is made, as published by Mexico’s Central Bank (Banco de México). If the Mexican
Guarantors elect to make payments due on the Notes in Mexican pesos in accordance with the Mexican
Monetary Law, we can make no assurances that the amounts paid may be converted back by the payee
into U.S. dollars or euros at the same exchange rate or that, if converted, such amounts would be
sufficient to purchase U.S. dollars or euros equal to the amount of principal, interest or additional amounts
due on the Notes.

Mexican law provides that contractual obligations such as those assumed by Guarantors are considered
to be ancillary obligations (obligaciones accesorias) to the principal obligations that they secure and
therefore the same may only exist to the extent that the obligations of the principal obligor are valid.
Therefore, it should be noted that upon a finding of lack of genuineness, validity or enforceability of the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the ancillary obligations of the Mexican Guarantors pursuant to
their guarantees shall be equally affected and in such circumstances the obligations provided for under
the Notes might not be enforced in a proceeding before a Mexican court.

In addition, under Mexican law, the extension or the granting of grace periods to the principal obligor(s),
any modification of guaranteed obligations that would increase any obligation of the Mexican Guarantors
pursuant to their Guarantees, or the novation (novación) of the principal obligation, would require the
consent of the Mexican Guarantors. Therefore, it should be noted that the obligations of the Mexican
Guarantors might not be enforced by Mexican courts if the guaranteed obligations are extended,
increased or novated (novadas) without the consent of the Mexican Guarantors at that time.

**Poland**

The obligations under a Guarantee granted by the Polish Guarantor are subject to limitations resulting
from the application of the bankruptcy laws, as set out in the Polish Bankruptcy Act (Prawo Upadłościowe)
of February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1228, as amended) (the “Polish Bankruptcy Law”)
and the restructuring laws, as set out in the Polish Restructuring Act (Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of
May 15, 2015 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 814, as amended) (the “Polish Restructuring Law”).
Moreover, the obligations under a Guarantee granted by the Polish Guarantor are subject to limitations
resulting from provisions regarding protection of share capital as further described under the heading
“Other Issues Concerning the Limitations and Effectiveness of the Guarantee” below.

**_Insolvency and Insolvency Threat_**

If a Polish Guarantor’s COMI (about which see further the section “—European Union” above) is in
Poland, then pursuant to Polish Bankruptcy Law and EU Insolvency Regulation, bankruptcy proceedings
of the Polish Guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court. Consequently, in the event of the
insolvency of such Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings would be governed by Polish law. Similarly,


-----

in the event of such Polish Guarantor insolvency or its threat, restructuring proceedings would also be
subject to Polish law.

According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Polish Guarantor will be declared bankrupt if it is insolvent.
The Polish Guarantor as a debtor will be insolvent: (i) if it has lost its ability to fulfill its due pecuniary
liabilities (wymagalne zobowiązania pieniężne) (cash flow test) (presumed to arise, if the delay in fulfilling
pecuniary obligations exceeds three months), or (ii) its pecuniary liabilities (except for future liabilities
and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect, granted within five years
before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its assets (except for assets not
constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24 months (balance sheet
test). It is presumed that the pecuniary liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets if, according to the
balance sheet, its liabilities (except for reserves for liabilities and liabilities to affiliates) exceed the value
of its assets and such situation persists beyond 24 months.

Despite meeting the balance sheet test by the Polish Guarantor, the Polish Bankruptcy Law allows the
court dismissing an application for bankruptcy if there is no threat of losing ability by the Polish Guarantor
to fulfill its due pecuniary liabilities in near future.

Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantor (whether individually or jointly) is
obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from when the grounds
for declaration of bankruptcy above are met.

Under the Polish Act of March 2, 2020 on specific solutions related to prevention, counteracting and
eradication of COVID-19, other contagious diseases and related crisis situations, as amended (the “Anti**Crisis Act”) debtors whose insolvency has occurred between March 14, 2020 and the date on which the**
state of epidemiological threat or epidemic in Poland due to COVID-19 is to be cancelled, are temporarily
exempt from the obligation to file a petition for bankruptcy if their insolvency was due to COVID-19 (it is
presumed that the insolvency was a result of COVID-19 if it arose during the state of epidemiological
threat or epidemic). After cessation of the state of epidemiological threat or epidemic, the 30-day deadline
for filing a petition for bankruptcy shall run anew.

Additionally, the Polish Guarantor’s personal creditors may file for bankruptcy of the Polish Guarantor.

According to the Polish Restructuring Law, restructuring proceedings may be opened in respect of the
Polish Guarantor as debtor if it is insolvent or is threatened with insolvency, i.e., if its commercial position
shows that it may become insolvent within a short period of time.

If the Polish Guarantor is insolvent or threatened with insolvency, it may file a restructuring motion. If the
Polish Guarantor is insolvent, a restructuring motion to open remedial proceedings may be filed by the
Polish Guarantor personal creditors.

If a motion for declaration of bankruptcy and motion for opening restructuring proceedings have both
been filed, the court should first decide on the restructuring motion and hold the proceedings on the
motion for bankruptcy (unless putting them on hold would be against the interests of all creditors). The
debtor cannot be declared bankrupt during restructuring proceedings.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

The principal aim of bankruptcy proceedings is the satisfaction of the creditors from the proceeds
obtained from the sale of the debtor’s assets (bankruptcy proceedings would result in dissolution of the
debtor’s company unless otherwise permitted by law). In the event of bankruptcy proceedings, the court
appoints a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over the management of the bankrupt’s assets. From
this moment on, the management of a debtor—bankrupt entity is replaced by the bankruptcy receiver
who administers the bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt entity. The bankrupt entity’s
assets become bankruptcy assets which will be liquidated to pay off creditors. The composition of
bankruptcy assets is determined during preparation of the inventory list and creditors’ receivables list
which are prepared by the bankruptcy receiver. A motion for approval of the terms of sale of the debtor’s
enterprise or its organized part, or substantial part of its assets, may be appended to the petition to
commence bankruptcy proceedings (pre-packaged liquidation).

Upon the bankruptcy declaration all of the debtor’s debts become due and payable and non-pecuniary
debts are converted to pecuniary and become due and payable. Interest may be paid from the bankruptcy


-----

estate only for the period up to the date of the declaration of bankruptcy, unless they are secured by
mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, and satisfied from
the security assets’ proceeds.

The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of
declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and payable. A
set-off is not admissible if the bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or endorsement after
bankruptcy was declared or acquired it during the year preceding the date of declaration of bankruptcy,
while being aware that there were grounds for declaring bankruptcy. However, this limitation does not
apply (i) if the acquirer has become the bankrupt’s creditor as a result of repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for
which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and if the acquirer was not aware of the
existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy at the time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or
(ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The
set off is also not admissible if bankrupt’s creditor became bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration
of bankruptcy. The sum proposed to be set off on the part of the bankrupt is the total of the bankrupt’s
claim and on the part of the creditor it is the creditor’s principal claim only, along with interests accrued
until the date of declaring bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt without interest had not become due and
payable by the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be set-off is the amount due reduced by
statutory interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of declaration of bankruptcy until
the date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must
make a statement in this respect not later than when submitting the claim.

Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject to security, charged with a
pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers
may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of
such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for bankruptcy.

Provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party which explicitly stipulate that the
agreement is amended or terminated in the case its bankruptcy (or filing for it) are invalid. Also, provisions
of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the
bankruptcy proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy
estate. These specific provisions of Polish Bankruptcy Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that
are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would apply
to an entity that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings under the Polish Bankruptcy Law.

If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration in
any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. In particular, unless
separate statutory laws provide otherwise, proceedings initiated against the bankrupt before the date of
declaration of bankruptcy concerning a claim which was submitted within the bankruptcy proceedings,
may be continued only if such a claim has not been included in the list of claims (see below) once the list
was finalized. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the bankruptcy
receiver replaces the bankrupt entity. If enforcement proceedings regarding the claims which may be
filed within the bankruptcy proceedings were pending against the bankrupt entity on the day of bankruptcy
declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and proceeds
received, are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy
becomes final. If the arbitration proceedings were not commenced on the date of declaration of
bankruptcy, the bankruptcy receiver may with the consent of the judge—commissioner renounce the
arbitration clauses if the arbitration proceedings hinder the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. If the
bankruptcy receiver renounces the arbitration clause, it expires.

Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring
bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of
claims. If a claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. Under the Polish
Bankruptcy Law, any debt payable in a currency other than Polish złoty (such as euro), if being put on the
list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average
exchange rate on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and
regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not).

In the bankruptcy proceedings, creditors under the Guarantee will be satisfied from the proceeds obtained
from the sale of the Polish Guarantor’s assets if their claim under the Notes or the Guarantee is due and
payable, otherwise the proceeds of that sale will be deposited in the court deposit in their favor and
released once their claim under the Guarantee becomes due and payable and not satisfied.


-----

As a rule, Polish Guarantor’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose receivables are
ranked in a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher category have been fully
satisfied. The first category principally includes payments to the state or employees (remuneration, health
benefit payments and social security obligations, etc.) or related to the restructuring proceedings
(including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit, or other form of
financing stated in the arrangement concluded in the restructuring proceedings and provided in
connection with the arrangement’s performance). Most unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public
dues are listed in the second category. The third category encompasses interest on debts in the first and
second categories (in the order in which the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties,
donations etc. The fourth category concerns debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to
loans and legal acts of similar effect that were granted within five years prior to the declaration of
bankruptcy including interest accrued thereon. Within each category, creditors’ receivables are satisfied
_pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category. Before satisfying any claims, the_
bankruptcy receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and the liabilities of the bankruptcy
estate.

The Polish Bankruptcy Law does not require a bankruptcy receiver to give effect to intercreditor
arrangements such as subordination agreements. Although the law does not preclude creditors from
attempting to enforce such rights in separate proceedings based on their entitlements arising from
respective contracts, such proceedings are conducted outside of and following bankruptcy proceedings.
Therefore, the claims of all unsecured creditors may be paid on a pari passu basis in bankruptcy
proceedings.

If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (the Polish Guarantor) is encumbered with a mortgage, pledge,
registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage, then a creditor has a right to be satisfied from
that asset before other creditors (with a few exceptions such as, for instance, a certain portion of
employee salaries). Where an asset is encumbered by a number of mortgages and pledges, secured
receivables are repaid according to their priority. The pledgee under the registered pledge or financial
pledge may seize the pledged object if the relevant pledge agreement provides for such method of
satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, seizure is not allowed if such object is the part of bankrupt’s
enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial than its separate
sale.

In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and creditors can be
voted on and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the court, the provisions of the
arrangement determine the manner of satisfaction of creditors’ receivables. If the repayment of
receivables arising under the Guarantee is covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such
receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be
subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Bankruptcy Law).

A creditor who fails to satisfy his claim during bankruptcy proceedings may try to raise this claim directly
against persons acting on behalf of the Polish Guarantor being a limited liability company. Pursuant to
the Polish Commercial Partnerships and Companies Code (Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of
September 15, 2000 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1526, as amended) (the “Polish Commercial
Companies Code”) if enforcement against a company proves to be ineffective, members of the
management board of a limited liability company shall be jointly and severally liable for the company’s
liabilities. A member of the management board may be discharged from liability referred to above if he
proves that the bankruptcy petition was filed in a timely manner or in the appropriate time the decision on
the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the approval of the arrangement in the approval
arrangement proceedings were issued, or that a failure to file a bankruptcy petition occurred through no
fault on his part or that despite the failure to file a bankruptcy petition or to issue the decision on the
opening of the restructuring proceedings or the decision on the approval the arrangement in the approval
arrangement proceedings, the creditor suffered no additional damage.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings essentially aim to avoid the debtor’s bankruptcy through its debt restructuring
under an arrangement with creditors and, in the event of remedial proceedings (postępowanie
_sanacyjne), also through remedial steps, while securing the justified rights of creditors._

Restructuring proceedings may be initiated by a debtor’s motion if the debtor is insolvent or threatened
with insolvency, or, in case of remedial proceedings also on debtor’s personal creditor’s motion, if the


-----

debtor is insolvent. The court will refuse to open restructuring proceedings, if they are detrimental to
creditors, or, in case of arrangement proceedings (postępowanie układowe) and remedial proceedings if
the debtor’s ability to fund the costs of such proceedings and obligations arising after the date of opening
of these proceedings cannot be substantiated.

The debtor may request the opening of one of the four following restructuring proceedings: (i) approval
arrangement proceedings, (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings; (iii) arrangement proceedings and
(iv) remedial proceedings.

In addition, in relation to COVID-19, on June 24, 2020, a new simplified restructuring proceeding entered
into force and will be applicable until June 30, 2021.

In the case of approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor solicits votes from creditors on a proposed
arrangement without participation of the court. Once creditors have cast a sufficient number of votes, the
debtor may apply to the court for approval of the arrangement. This type of proceedings is available
when the sum of the disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims.

Accelerated arrangement proceedings are designed to allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with
the creditors following the preparation of a list of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge—
commissioner in simplified proceedings. The procedure may be applied provided that the sum of disputed
claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims. At the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings,
the debtor’s assets constitute the arrangement estate. The arrangement estate is administered by the
debtor, unless the court decides that an administrator should be appointed (e.g. if the debtor fails to
perform the instructions of the judge—commissioner or the court supervisor). From the opening of
accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor or administrator (if appointed) cannot satisfy any
creditors’ receivable which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement
proceedings concerning the claims to be covered by the arrangement are stayed by the operation of law.

In arrangement proceedings, an arrangement may be concluded following the preparation of the list of
creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge-commissioner in ordinary proceedings. This procedure
may be used when the sum of the disputed claims exceeds 15% of the total claims. As in accelerated
arrangement proceedings, the assets of the debtor form the arrangement estate, which is administered
by the debtor or administrator (if appointed). The debtor, or administrator (if appointed) also may not
satisfy any debt which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings
concerning the claims to be covered by the arrangement are also stayed by the operation of law.

Remedial proceedings allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with creditors and undertake various
remedial actions which aim to improve the economic situation of the debtor and restore the debtor’s
capacity to perform his obligations. At the opening of remedial proceedings, the debtor is deprived of its
right to administer its assets (from the opening of proceedings they constitute the remedial estate) and
the assets are administered by a court-appointed administrator (unless the court allows the debtor to
retain the right to administer the remedial estate). The administrator can undertake a number of
restructuring steps, including renouncing a not performed mutual agreement, or challenging the
effectiveness of certain acts undertaken by the debtor before filing the motion to open remedial
proceedings. Upon opening of the remedial proceedings, the debtor or administrator are legally prohibited
from making payments to satisfy claims which are covered by the arrangement. The enforcement
proceedings are also stayed by the operation of law.

The claim of the company which is subject to restructuring may be set off against a creditor’s claim if
both claims existed on the date of opening of restructuring proceedings (other than the approval
arrangement proceedings). However, the set-off is not admissible if (i) the creditor became a debtor or
the debtor after the opening of the restructuring proceedings or (ii) the debtor of the company subject to
restructuring acquired the claim against the company subject to restructuring by assignment or
endorsement after opening of the restructuring proceedings and such claim came into existence prior to
the opening of the restructuring proceedings. This limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become
the creditor of company subject to restructuring as a result of repaying such company’s debt, for which it
was liable personally or with certain property items, and (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year
before the date of opening of the restructuring proceedings. Similarly, the set-off is not permissible if the
creditor of the company subject to restructuring has become a debtor of such company after the opening
of the restructuring proceedings. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement
within 30 days from opening of the restructuring proceedings and if the grounds for the set-off arose
after that date, then within 30 days from arising of the ground for set off.


-----

Once the accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings or remedial proceedings are
opened, the entity’s assets may not be encumbered with security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge
or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to
establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had
been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for opening of the proceedings.

Additionally, provisions of an agreement, to which the debtor is a party, which explicitly stipulate that the
agreement is amended or terminated in the case of opening restructuring proceedings (or filing for it)
(except for approval arrangement proceedings) are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the
debtor is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the restructuring proceedings from being achieved will
be deemed ineffective in relation to the arrangement or remedial estate (as applicable). These specific
provisions of the Polish Restructuring Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that are subject to laws
other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is
subject to restructuring proceedings (other than approval arrangement proceedings) under the Polish
Restructuring Law.

If the arrangement proceedings or accelerated arrangement proceedings are opened with respect to the
Polish Guarantor, then certain actions in court proceedings against the Polish Guarantor will require court
supervisor’s consent. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables which are subject to
arrangement were pending against the Polish Guarantor on the day of the opening of such restructuring
proceedings, they are suspended with effect from the opening of such proceedings and proceeds
received are transferred to the arrangement estate after the issuance of decision on opening of the
restructuring proceedings. The creditor secured with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury
pledge and/or maritime mortgage can conduct the enforcement only with respect to the object of such
property right. The court may also stay the enforcement of the claim which is not subject to the
arrangement for the period of up to three months if such enforcement concerns the object which is
necessary to run the Polish Guarantor’s enterprise.

In the case of opening of the remedial proceedings against the Polish Guarantor, if proceedings were
pending in which the Polish Guarantor was the plaintiff, the administrator replaces the Polish Guarantor.
If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables were pending against the Polish Guarantor on the
day of opening of the remedial proceeding, they are suspended and proceeds received are transferred to
the remedial estate after the issuance of decision on the opening of the remedial proceedings.

If creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved by the court.
The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed against. An approved arrangement is
binding on (affects) all creditors, whose receivables are covered by the arrangement. Certain receivables
are not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include, among other things: (i) receivables secured
with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, however only
up to the value of the collateral (to the extent they can be satisfied from the security assets on which such
security was established); a creditor whose claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject
to arrangement, (ii) receivables under derivative or repo transactions, and (iii) receivables under
employment contracts.

The arrangement may also concern only certain types of receivables (partial arrangement). In such
case, the arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors who have receivables of such type. In a partial
arrangement, there are several exceptions to the general rule that receivables secured by mortgages,
pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages are not covered by the
arrangement, without the consent of the creditor, up to the value of the collateral. The consent of the
creditor is not required, if the arrangement’s initial proposals stipulate full satisfaction of the creditor
within the timeframe specified in the arrangement, or if they stipulate satisfaction to an extent not less
than may be expected from the collateral.

If the receivables arising under the Guarantee are covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that
such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be
subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Restructuring Law).

A simplified restructuring proceeding is a hybrid of solutions provided for in other restructuring
proceedings. It is for the most part extrajudicial and refers to the approval arrangement proceedings
regulated in the Polish Restructuring Law, but with significant modifications. A simplified restructuring
proceeding is opened automatically by publishing an announcement in the judicial and commercial journal
“Monitor Sądowy i Gospodarczy”, indicating the debtor’s details, the arrangement date, and the


-----

arrangement supervisor. Before making an announcement, the debtor prepares and submits to the
selected arrangement supervisor arrangement proposals, a list of claims, and a list of disputed claims.
As in the approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor, with the help of a restructuring adviser, presents
creditors with arrangement proposals, collects their votes and, only at the end, applies to the court for
approval of the arrangement, which has already been voted on. A creditors’ meeting to vote on the
arrangement may be conducted remotely using electronic communications. The application for approval
of the arrangement must be submitted to the court no later than four months after the announcement in
“Monitor Sądowy i Gospodarczy”. If no application for approval is filed within this period, the proceedings
will be discontinued by operation of law.

During the period from the date of making an announcement on opening the simplified restructuring
procedure to the date of completion or discontinuance, existing enforcement proceedings are suspended
by operation of law and no new proceedings may be instigated against the debtor. In addition, during the
period of simplified restructuring, it is prohibited to terminate key agreements concluded with the debtor,
including rental, tenancy, leasing or loan agreements, without the arrangement supervisor’s permission.
There is also a ban, known from the accelerated arrangement procedure, on payment of claims covered
by the arrangement by operation of law, as well as restrictions on the set-off. Another new feature is the
possibility to include in the arrangement a claim secured against the debtor’s assets without the in rem
creditor’s consent.

Any creditor may apply to the court for lifting in its entirety of the effects of the announcement of the
opening of a simplified restructuring proceeding, including the prohibition of enforcement against the
debtor’s assets. Creditors will also be entitled to pursue a claim for redress of damages if the debtor
made an announcement on the opening of proceedings in bad faith.

**Limitations and Effectiveness of the Guarantee in Bankruptcy or Restructuring Proceedings**

Pursuant to Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law, a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent
if its liabilities (zobowiązania) (excluding future liabilities and liabilities toward the shareholders under
loans or legal acts of similar effect, granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed
the value of its assets (property) (majątek) (except for assets which do not form part of the bankruptcy
estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24 months. Given certain legal controversies regarding
the application of this rule, and in order to mitigate the possibility that the Polish Guarantor could be
declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of any Polish Guarantor on account of payments under the
Guarantee shall be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish Guarantor’s assets (except for assets
which do not form part of the bankruptcy estate). This limitation of liability will no longer apply when the
Polish Guarantor becomes insolvent in the meaning of Article 11 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law or upon
acceleration of the receivables under the Guarantee (in spite of the previous application of that limitation
of liability).

Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Guarantee may be declared ineffective or deemed to be ineffective
in certain situations. In particular, the enforceability of the receivables arising under the Guarantee in the
insolvency proceedings depends on whether it was granted at least six months before the filing of the
motion for bankruptcy of the Polish Guarantor and, furthermore, whether the secured receivables are
due and payable. Pursuant to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, if: (i) the debt secured by the Guarantee is not
due (dług niewymagalny); and (ii) the Guarantee was granted within six months before the filing of the
motion for bankruptcy, then it will be deemed ineffective. However, in such case, the creditor may bring an
action or charge in order to seek the recognition of the Guarantee as effective if at the time when the
same was granted the creditor was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaration of bankruptcy of
the grantor.

Furthermore, if the Guarantee is granted within six months preceding the date of the filing of the motion
for bankruptcy, it will be assessed whether the Guarantee in this state of facts was granted by the bankrupt
entity to its partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their
partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in
the event of either being the controlling company. If so, the Guarantee will be declared ineffective towards
the bankruptcy estate, unless the other party is able to prove that it is not detrimental to other creditors.

The disposals made by the bankrupt in respect of its estate (czynności prawne, którymi upadły
_rozporządził swoim majątkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will be_
deemed ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the disposal significantly (rażąco)
exceeded consideration for the bankrupt, or there was no consideration for the bankrupt. It is not entirely


-----

clear under the Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions
since it is debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals.

Under the Polish Restructuring Law, the Guarantee may also be declared ineffective or deemed ineffective
in certain situations.

The disposals made by the debtor in respect of its estate (czynności prawne, którymi dłużnik rozporządził
_swoim majątkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for remedial proceedings will be deemed_
ineffective towards the remedial estate if the value of the disposal materially (istotnie) exceeded
consideration for the debtor or third party, or there was no consideration for the debtor. It is not entirely
clear under the Polish Restructuring Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions
since it is debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals.

Additionally, pursuant to the Polish Restructuring Law, if: (i) the Guarantee was granted within one year
before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings; and (ii) the Guarantee was not
granted directly in connection with consideration received by the Polish Guarantor, then the Guarantee
will be ineffective towards the remedial estate.

The Guarantee will be ineffective towards the remedial estate in the part in which it exceeds (as at the
date of granting the Guarantee) the value of the secured claim together with ancillary claims specified in
the document establishing the Guarantee by more than a half, and provided that the Guarantee was
granted within a year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

Under the Polish Civil Code of April 23, 1964 (Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1740, as amended, the
“Polish Civil Code”), a creditor (or, if the debtor is declared bankrupt, the bankruptcy receiver) may
request that the relevant Polish court declare a given legal act (such as the granting of a guarantee)
ineffective towards such creditor, and the court will do so if it finds that granting a guarantee constituted
a transaction effected by a debtor to the detriment of its creditors (i.e., where the debtor became insolvent
or became insolvent to a greater extent as a result of the transaction) while a third party has gained a
benefit, and provided that (i) the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment and (ii) the third
party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have known that the debtor was acting to the
detriment of its other creditors (and the third party’s knowledge that the debtor consciously acted to the
creditors’ detriment is presumed if the entrepreneur who received the benefit as a result of the transaction
with the debtor remained in a permanent economic relationship with such debtor) or gave no
consideration for the benefit obtained in such transaction.

In addition, if a Polish Guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially impossible
to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such an agreement
ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish Guarantor and the other party to the agreement knew
of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.

The creditor with respect to whom the company’s legal transaction was declared ineffective may, with
priority over the creditors of the third party, enforce the rights over assets which as a result of such legal
transaction, were removed from the company’s estate or did not become a part of the estate.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law
applied. Generally, however, the Polish Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its
debts as they became due. If a court decided that the Guarantee provided by the Polish Guarantor was
a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee or held it unenforceable for any other reason, a
holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of the Polish Guarantor and would be a
creditor solely of the Issuers and remaining Guarantors.

**_Application of Foreign Law_**

If any obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the Republic of Poland, it might not be
enforceable in the Republic of Poland, inter alia, to the extent that such performance would be illegal or
contrary to public policy under the laws of the other jurisdiction and a Polish court may take into account
the law of the place of performance when evaluating the manner of performance and the steps to be
taken in the event of defective performance.


-----

No law of any other jurisdiction will apply in the Republic of Poland if its application would have an effect
that is contrary to the basic principles of public order in the Republic of Poland (principles of social
co-existence).

**Other Issues Concerning the Limitations and Effectiveness of the Guarantee**

The Guarantee issued by the Polish Guarantor is subject to certain provisions of the Polish Commercial
Companies Code.

In accordance with Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, shareholders of a limited
liability company (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością) may not receive, on whatever account,
payments out of company’s assets which are necessary for the share capital to be fully paid up. A more
general Article 189 § 1 prohibits the return of contributions to share capital to such shareholders. In
relation to a Polish joint stock company (spółka akcyjna) Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial
Companies Code stipulates that no payments for shares may be reimbursed to a shareholder, either fully
or partially, except as allowed by the law for the duration of the company’s existence. In the Polish legal
doctrine opinions are expressed that in certain situations, for example, when the financial standing of a
company entering into a transaction is poor and the shareholder of such a company benefits from a
transaction, it may constitute in fact the return of share capital contribution to the shareholder. A breach
of these rules results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share
capital. Therefore, there is a risk that the Guarantee of the Polish Guarantor in such form will be affected,
or could be set aside, to the extent it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to cover in full its
share capital in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, a return of
contribution to share capital prohibited by Article 189 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, or
a payment prohibited by Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

Additionally, in respect of the joint stock companies, Article 345 of the Polish Commercial Companies
Code stipulates certain conditions for granting financial assistance by a joint stock company for the
acquisition of its shares. If these strict conditions are not met, then the financial assistance is unlawful
and all the payments are invalid. Moreover, financial assistance is understood broadly as providing by a
company, directly or indirectly, any financing for the purposes of the acquisition of shares issued by that
company, inter alia by granting of credit, loan, guarantee or security. Therefore, in case the Polish
Guarantor will have the form of a joint stock company, the Guarantee will state that it does not apply to
any liability of the Polish Guarantor to the extent that it would result in the Guarantee constituting unlawful
financial assistance within the meaning of Article 345 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

**_Maximum interest rate_**

According to Article 359§2(1) of the Polish Civil Code), the maximum rate of interest (odsetki
_maksymalne) cannot be higher than two times the statutory interest rate (equal to the reference rate of_
the National Bank of Poland (the “NBP”) plus 3.5 percentage points). Moreover, according to 481§2(1) of
the Polish Civil Code the maximum rate of default interest (odsetki maksymalne za opóźnienie) cannot
be higher than two times the default statutory interest rate (equal to the reference rate of the NBP plus
5.5 percentage points). As of the date hereof the maximum interest rate resulting from a legal transaction
is equal to 7.2% p.a. and the maximum default interest rate is equal to 11.2% p.a.

Regulation on the maximum interest rates applies irrespectively of the law governing the agreement.
Consequence of breach of the provisions on maximum interest rates is an automatic application of the
maximum interests stipulated in Polish law as opposed to the agreed higher rate and, therefore, there is
a risk that Polish courts may refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment for the payment of
interest or default interest if the rate of interest or default interest is higher than the relevant Polish
maximum rate.

**Spain**

Under Spanish law, the guarantees and the security interests must guarantee or secure a primary
obligation and therefore, they have an ancillary nature. Due to this, they would be declared null, void
and/or terminated if the principal obligation is declared null, void and/or terminated. Any transfer of the
principal obligation carries along with it the transfer of the security interest. Additionally, the transfer of
the security interest itself cannot be done independently from the principal obligation due to its accessory
nature. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are not existing and
valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the relevant guarantee or


-----

security are not enforceable because the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant
guarantee or security agreement are not existing and valid obligations. In addition, a guarantee or security
interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable)
the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any
amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the underlying agreements
governing the guaranteed or secured obligations. Therefore, the primary obligation must be clearly
identified in the guarantee or security agreement and they should be amended in parallel to any
amendment of the primary obligation to clearly reflect the scope of the guaranteed and secured
obligations and the identity of the guaranteed or secured parties.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default
were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of
acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on
objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by
Article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

A Spanish company must have a corporate interest in granting a guarantee or a security interest. It is
difficult to determine whether or not a corporate benefit is obtained when granting the socalled upstream
security interests. Some factors may be considered, such as the receipt by the Spanish company of the
funds (even indirectly) or the actual benefit that the Spanish company receives from the financing. The
absence of a corporate interest may lead to the creditors of the Spanish company to contest, on the
grounds of Article 1,111 of the Spanish Civil Code, acts carried out by the Spanish company implying
fraud of the creditors’ rights. In addition, directors’ liability may be triggered. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—The insolvency laws of applicable_
_jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you are_
_familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance or corporate assistance_
_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability”._

In particular, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes. Recent
Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that
risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to
guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable
and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under
the corporate interest of such company. Therefore, as stated in section “Insolvency laws” below,
guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor of other group companies may be challenged on the
basis that such guarantees have no consideration unless evidence could be provided that there was a
tangible and identifiable economic interest for the Spanish companies (beyond an abstract group interest).
Whether there is a specific consideration in favor of the guarantor for the granting of the guarantee, is a
factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis. The lack of proof in that regard, may
entail, if the guarantee is challenged, that a judge declares the guarantee null and/or void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity
of upstream guarantees.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas)
in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company,
and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the
acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore,
guarantees or security interests granted by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain (for the
purpose of this section, each a “Spanish guarantor”) shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred
by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish guarantor/Spanish subsidiary or
the shares or its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the
extent that such guarantee or security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the
meaning of Articles 150 and 143 of the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2
_de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish_
**Companies Act”). This limitation would also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt although this is**
widely debated between academics. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, any guarantee
or security interest granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are
not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes.

For the purposes of the previous paragraph, a reference to a “parent company” of the Spanish guarantor
shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such
Spanish guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish guarantor. It shall be presumed


-----

that a company has a dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in
section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met.

In addition, a reference to the “group” of each Spanish guarantor shall mean the group of companies that
have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above).

In accordance with the abovementioned, the Guarantees and any security interests granted by Spanish
companies belonging to the Group, shall not guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed,
would constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in accordance with Articles 143.2
and/or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act.

In addition, and whilst this remains debatable, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish
Guarantors relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital
preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee. Such limitation,
_inter alia, may be referred to the net equity, net assets or share capital of the Spanish Guarantors or even_
the portion of the proceeds of the Notes used directly or indirectly to pay or refinance obligations of the
Spanish Guarantor.

**_First demand guarantee_**

The structure of first demand guarantees is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code but their
validity and effectiveness have been reviewed in several judgments and defined by the Spanish Supreme
Court (Tribunal Supremo) as autonomous guarantees, detached from the underlying agreement whose
obligations are being guaranteed. These judgments acknowledge the validity of provisions pursuant to
which guarantors waive the ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those stated under the
guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with
certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or
abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the event where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a
fraudulent manner or in bad faith. Certain case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay
enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of
proof), usually through a motion for declaratory relief filed by the guarantor.

_Enforcement Proceedings in Spain_

Creditors are entitled to initiate actions under the following three types of proceedings: (i) the socalled
declarative proceeding (juicio declarativo) provided for under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000, of
January 7, 2000 (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil); (ii) the executive proceeding (juicio
_ejecutivo) provided for under the same Spanish regulation; and (iii) the procedure managed by notaries_
to enforce guarantees under Article 1,872 of the Spanish Civil Code, which must be jointly interpreted
with the Notary Public Law of 28 May 1862 (the “Notarial Law”) that establishes the requisites to be met
by the mentioned notary public auction system regulated in the Spanish Civil Code. The aforementioned
procedures are aimed at selling the relevant asset in a public auction monitored either by a Court or by a
notary public if the debtor does not verify payment of the amount due prior to the public auction. As for
first demand guarantees, either declarative proceedings or executive proceedings (if the guarantee is
granted in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000) could be used to enforce payment
from the guarantor.

_Insolvency laws_

Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015
on insolvency proceedings and the Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of May 5, by virtue of
which the Restated Spanish Insolvency Act is approved (the “Spanish Insolvency Act”), where a
Spanish company conducts business in another country, the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts may be
limited if the company’s center of main interest is found to be in a country other than the Kingdom of
Spain. This “centre of main interests” is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties.

Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “centre of main interests” are considered “the
principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party
worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the
“centre of main interests” is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain,
Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency
**proceedings”).**


-----

As a general rule, in the event of an insolvency of the a Spanish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings
(bankruptcy) may be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law (provided that the “centre of main
interests” of the Spanish Guarantor is considered to be located in Spain) in accordance with the Spanish
Insolvency Act.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Spanish Insolvency Act and of various
extraordinary resolutions including, Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of March 17, of urgent extraordinary
measures to mitigate the economic and social impact of COVID-19 (Real Decreto-ley 8/2020, de 17 de
_marzo, de medidas urgentes extraordinarias para hacer frente al impacto económico y social del_
_COVID-19), Royal Decree-Law 16/2020, of April 28, of procedural and organizational measures against_
COVID-19 in the field of the Department of Justice (Real Decreto-ley 16/2020, de 28 de abril, de medidas
_procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia),_
which was repealed by and its relevant provisions incorporated in Act 3/2020, of September 18, of
procedural and organizational measures against COVID-19 in the field of the Department of Justice (Ley
_3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en_
_el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Act 3/2020”) and Royal Decree-Law 34/2020, of_
November 17, of urgent measures to support corporate solvency and the energy sector, and on tax
matters (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia
_empresarial y al sector energético, y en materia tributaria) (altogether the “COVID-19 Regulations”)._
These resolutions have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact
preinsolvency and insolvency proceedings. Among other measures related to debtors which have already
filed for insolvency or subject to opened insolvency proceedings or which have entered into composition
agreements or refinancing scheme agreements before the enactment of the COVID-19 Regulations, the
main measures related to insolvency law introduced by the COVID-19 Regulations summarily include:

1. Insolvency moratorium: the COVID-19 Regulations entailed the introduction and subsequent
extensions of an exemption for directors in relation to their duty to file for insolvency irrespective of
whether they have notified the Court of the initiation of negotiations for debt restructuring with
creditors until December 31, 2021.

2. New money provided by specially related persons: the COVID-19 Regulations set forth that
as regards insolvency proceedings declared within two years of the declaration of the state of alarm
(estado de alarma) in Spain, i.e. March 14, 2020, new money provided by specially related persons
and any claims in which such specially related person is subrogated after such date will have the
consideration of ordinary claims, thus not subordinated.

3. Insolvency proceedings and liquidation plans: the COVID-19 Regulations introduced
different measures to accelerate insolvency proceedings. In relation to those insolvency proceedings
opened within two years of the declaration of the state of alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain, i.e.
March 14, 2020, challenges against the list of creditors or assets (inventario) will need to be
sustained on documentary or expert evidence (prueba pericial). In relation to those insolvency
proceedings already opened at the date of declaration of the state of alarm (estado de alarma) or
those opened in the following year, and subject to certain exceptions, all auctions shall be out of
court auctions (subastas extrajudiciales). Finally, as a general measure, the approval of liquidation
plans has been expedited.

The Spanish Insolvency Act regulates insolvency proceedings, as opposed to outofcourt liquidation
(which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law, is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet
its liabilities).

The Spanish fullblown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de
_acreedores” applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the_
Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the
implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (composition agreement) or to the
liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

Both the debtor and creditors may initiate the insolvency proceeding. Bankruptcy is considered voluntary
(concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor and involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a thirdparty
creditor.

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the insolvency petition upon inability to
regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for
such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due.


-----

It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the
circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor
fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors
may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the insolvency is declared
and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action
(including, inter alia, the possibility of submitting a prearranged settlement proposal); and (iii) the directors
may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the debtor
be liquidated and insolvency be classified as “guilty”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as stated above,
pursuant to article 6.1 of Act 3/2020, until 14 March 2021 (inclusive), or later if this term is extended,
debtors that are insolvent will not have the duty to file for insolvency proceedings, whether or not they
have notified the judge that negotiations have been opened with creditors to reach a refinancing
agreement, an outofcourt payment agreement (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) or adherences to a
debtor’s voluntary arrangement (propuesta anticipada de convenio). Moreover, pursuant to article 6.2 of
Act 3/2020, until 14 March 2021 (inclusive) the courts will not accept mandatory insolvency filings filed
after the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain on 14 March 2020.

The general obligation to file for insolvency within two months from the date of being in a situation of
current insolvency (insolvencia actual) does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it
has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain accessions to a prearranged anticipated composition
agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or to reach an outofcourt refinancing agreement set out
in Articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (“notice of negotiation with creditors”) and Articles
597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Effectively, by means of the notice of negotiation with creditors
of the Articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the debtor gains a threemonth period to achieve
an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one
further month to file for insolvency, if after the above mentioned period of three months has elapsed
without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time,
creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and enforcement will be prevented: (i) by
creditors, other than public, over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business
activities; and (ii) by financial creditors over any asset, provided financial creditors holding at least 51% of
the total financial indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence
negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or continue
enforcement proceedings against the debtor pursuant to Article 590 of the Spanish Insolvency Act.
Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced
before the filing for a preinsolvency moratorium will be suspended.

Creditors may file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor but must provide evidence of its actual
and not just its imminent insolvency. To this end, creditors must prove to the court: (i) a generalized
default on payments by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the
debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale”, hasty, lossmaking or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s
assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the
applicable statutory period (i.e. three months) prior to the filing of the relevant insolvency request, (v) that
the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed, or (vi) there is a
final previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency. However, creditors having acquired debt
by means of inter vivos acts and by a singular title after becoming due and payable may not file for the
declaration of insolvency of the debtor within six months of the date of the debt acquisition.

Creditors must communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal) within one
month from the publication of the judicial resolution declaring the insolvency of the debtor in the Official
Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. In
addition, the insolvency trustee is obliged to include all creditors appearing in the corporate
documentation of the debtor in the list of creditors to be attached to the insolvency trustee’s report, even
if such creditors did not communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee.

The sole declaration of insolvency does not imply the automatic suspension of the business activities of
the debtor. The insolvency court can either determine that the debtor continues to be managed by its
management body under the supervision of the insolvency trustee, or that the management body loses
control over the debtor, in which case the insolvency trustee will take over the full management of the
debtor.

The debtor may not carry out any management activity or enter into any new transactions concerning the
disposal of its assets, unless approved by either the insolvency trustee or the management body with the


-----

authorization of the insolvency trustee. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required
supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void.

Neither private nor governmentallyled foreclosure proceedings can be initiated or continued against the
debtor’s assets after its declaration of insolvency. See the previous section “—Enforcement Proceedings
_in Spain” for any details on the exceptions to the foregoing._

Setoff is not allowed under the Spanish Insolvency Act once a debtor has been declared insolvent, but
where the operating requirements of setoff are met before the declaration of insolvency, setoff can still
apply. However, setoff may be exercised by a determined creditor visàvis the insolvent company if the
law governing the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it during insolvency
proceedings. Accrual of both legal and contractual interest is suspended from the declaration of the
insolvency except for those credits secured with in rem security up to the maximum amount covered by
the relevant security.

The general rule is the maintenance of all contracts entered into by the debtor from which obligations
derive for both parties that are still outstanding, regardless of the declaration of insolvency or the
existence of an early termination for insolvency clause in the relevant contract (which shall be deemed as
not included within the agreement). Contracts can be terminated if one of the parties breaches its
contractual obligations, although the court, even existing a termination cause, may force the fulfillment of
the contract if it is in the interest of the debtor’s estate. Contracts can also be terminated if the insolvency
trustees deem it convenient for the debtor’s estate upon approval of the insolvency court. In addition, the
insolvency trustees and, under certain circumstances, other creditors may seek the termination of certain
acts and contracts harmful to the debtor’s estate by initiating a clawback action (see further details
below). There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which
are dealt with by the insolvency court.

The judge’s insolvency resolution contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to
them within a onemonth period, by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. Based on
such documentation provided by the creditors and that held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws
up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law,
which are as follows: (i) claims benefiting from special privileges, (ii) claims benefitting from general
privileges, (iii) ordinary claims and (iv) subordinated claims.

(a) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in
_rem security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain_
assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such
security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the
reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in
the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of
their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims may entail
separate proceedings, and are subject to certain restrictions related to a mandatory waiting
period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish
Insolvency Act, provided that the relevant asset is necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s
business. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain
suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the
relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors
are not subject to composition agreements (convenios), unless they give their express support
by voting in favor of the arrangement or, in case they do not give such express support, if
creditors holding security which represent at least 65% (or 80% depending on the conditions of
the composition agreement) of the total value of the specially privileged secured claims of the
same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the
first to collect payment against the secured assets.

(c) Claims benefiting from general privileges including, among others, certain labor debts and
certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding
to tax debts and social security obligations are recognized as privileged for half of their amount,
and so is 50% of the amount of the claims held by the creditor applying for the corresponding
insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved. New funds under a
refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Articles
596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the
insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The holders


-----

of general privileges are not to be affected by the restructuring (if under a composition
agreement) except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the composition
agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims
benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the
conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general
privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not agree
to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the
order established by law) and with the exception of secured assets, from which payments will
be collected first by the relevant creditors holding claims with a special privilege.

(d) Ordinary claims (nonsubordinated and nonprivileged claims) will be paid on a prorated basis
from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former prededuction of estate
claims and generally privileged claims.

(e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by
virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with
the debtor. In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives. In the case of a legal entity,
this includes directors (whether duly appointed or “de facto” acting as such—administradores
_de hecho) and those holding general powers of attorney (including those that have held those_
positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration); group companies and their
common shareholders, and any shareholders holding over 5% (for listed companies) or 10%
(for nonlisted companies) of the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who
have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant
to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Articles 596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special
relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing
granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this
paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the
acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared
open. Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest unless and to the extent they are secured
by an in rem right are also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are secondlevel creditors; they
may not vote on a composition agreement (convenio) and in the event of liquidation collect
payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act (once ordinary
creditors have been paid in full). Exceptionally, Article 7 of Act 3/2020 establishes that credits
deriving from “cash receipts from loans, credits or other analogous transactions” granted to the
debtor after the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain (i.e. 14 March 2020) by “specially
related parties” will rank as ordinary claims if the debtor’s insolvency is declared before 14
March 2022. Likewise, ordinary and privileged credits of third parties upon which specially
related persons have been subrogated as a consequence of the payment of those debts in the
name and representation of the debtor as from 14 March 2020 will also rank as ordinary claims
(and will keep any privilege of the credits, if applicable) in the debtor’s insolvency is declared
before 14 March 2022.

Notwithstanding the above, some claims are considered credits against the debtor’s estate and will be
generally payable when due according to their own terms. Debts against the insolvency estate, include,
among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency
proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal
contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after the insolvency of the debtor is declared
(including the amounts payable as a consequence of the voluntary termination or breach of contract by
the insolvent debtor if such breach or termination takes place after the declaration of its insolvency),
(iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw back actions within the insolvency proceedings of acts
performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in
cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from noncontractual
liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain
debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency, (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit
rights granted to the debtor under a viability plan (plan de viabilidad) (“VP”) in accordance with Article 672
of the Spanish Insolvency Act, excluding claims granted by “specially related parties” to the debtor
through a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose (Article 4.3 of Act 3/2020 provides
an exception of this limitation in relation to “specially related parties” in case there is a default of a VP
approved or modified between 14 March 2020 and 14 March 2022, as long as the new VP, or the amended


-----

one, identifies the obligor and the maximum amount of the financing to be granted or the guarantee to be
perfected), and (viii) in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the funds lent in compliance with a
refinancing arrangement in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 596 et seq. of the
Spanish Insolvency Act (except for new funds granted by persons specially related to the debtor through
a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose).

Once the insolvency proceeding is instituted, the harmful actions to the debtor’s estate carried out by the
debtor within two years prior to the date of declaration of the insolvency proceeding may be declared
rescinded (rescindido) or clawed back. Some transactions are presumed detrimental to the debtor’s
estate without the parties being able to provide evidence to the contrary, nonrebuttable presumptions,
(e.g., disposal of assets without consideration and payment of nonmatured unsecured obligations). In
some cases, the prejudice is presumed although such presumption can be challenged (rebuttable
presumption) as in the case of (i) disposal acts in favor of speciallyrelated persons to the debtor; (ii) the
granting of in rem rights as security for preexisting obligations (or new obligations in substitution of the
preexisting obligations); or (iii) early repayment of secured obligations. In the remaining cases, detriment
would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s
ordinary course of the business, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii) actions
contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, setoff or liquidation of values and
derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of the
labor authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the transaction can
prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to; and (v) transactions
that are a result of the implementation of resolutions measures upon credit entities and investment
services entities.

The Spanish Insolvency Act excludes as well certain types of refinancing agreements from the scope of
clawback actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted in execution of such agreements
as explained in the “—Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain” section below.

On top of clawback actions, acts and contracts entered into by the debtor in fraud of creditors within the
last four years may be judicially challenged (through the socalled “actio pauliana”).

If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction,
together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to
the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the
assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been
conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages
suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction
was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the
restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts.

The foreclosure of a security interest under the different proceedings set forth in the Spanish Civil
Procedure Law (e.g., judicial or notarial auction) does not guarantee at least in practice that the proceeds
to be obtained as a result of the enforcement proceeding are equivalent to the amount secured by such
asset or even to the value on the asset.

Enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in
excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under condition less favorable than those applicable
to the principal debtor.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other
group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security
interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show
that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or
security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of
companies or the socalled “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or
security by the guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be
proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees.


-----

_Conclusion of insolvency_

_Settlement_

Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages
creditors to reach a composition agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. Such an
agreement may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors whose credits exceed a fifth of all
claims (masa pasiva), and shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once
executed, the composition agreement must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors.

The composition agreement must contain proposals for writeoffs and stays for a shorter period than
10 years. Articles 317 and 327 of Spanish Insolvency Act provide that it may also contain alternative or
additional proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including
conversion of credits into shares, into profitsharing credits, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or
any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all
assets or of certain assets related to the debtor’s business activity to a specific person with a commitment
from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the composition
agreement.

The proposals in the composition agreement shall include a payment schedule in accordance with
Article 331 of Spanish Insolvency Act.

In order for a composition agreement to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities
shall be met at the creditors’ meeting:

(a) In case the composition agreement contains writeoffs equal to or less than 50% of the amount
of the claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for
a period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the
public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating
loans (préstamos participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of the ordinary claims have
voted in favor of such composition agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will
suffice when the composition agreement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary claims within a
period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary claims
applying a write off of less than 20%.

(b) In case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, it will be
required that at least the 65% of the ordinary credits should have voted for the composition
agreement.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor
are not entitled to vote.

Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved composition agreement (unless
they have expressly voted in its favor or adhered thereto), the effects of an approved composition
agreement can be extended to privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition agreement has
been approved by the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors,
public law creditors, financial creditors or others):

(a) In case the composition agreement contains the full payment of ordinary claims within a period
not exceeding three years or the immediate payment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a
write off of less than 20%, a writeoff (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the
amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into profit
participating loans, also for a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors
have voted in favor; and

(b) In case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, at least
75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor.

_Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain_

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements (outofcourt workouts) can also be
judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual
insolvency proceedings of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into
such refinancing agreements, provided that, among other requirements, (i) they entail a significant

enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either granting a longer term or
replacing previous claims with new ones, all these in accordance with a viability plan enabling the
continuity of the debtor business activity in the short and medium term; (ii) they have been subscribed by
creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether
or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish Insolvency Act excludes public creditors,
labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds
are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate
acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, the
majority refers both individually to each company and to the Group as a whole where the intercompany
claims are not taken into account); and (iv) the refinancing agreement and the documents sustaining
performance of conditions (i) to (iii) above are formalized in a notarial deed. Such judicially sanctioned
refinancing agreements may not be subject to a clawback action, but may be challenged in certain cases
pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law (i.e., in case of breach of formalities or in case they
impose disproportionate sacrifices on dissenting creditors—see below).

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an
interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement (for the
purposes of petitioning protection against clawback) if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the
liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on dissenting
or nonparticipating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that
part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, provided they achieve the thresholds
mentioned below:

(a) Pursuant to Article 623 of Spanish Insolvency Act, if the judicially sanctioned refinancing
agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities,
stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt converted into socalled profit
participation loans (préstamos participativos) of duration up to five years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of the specially privileged secured claims
of nonparticipating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by
financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all
specially privileged secured claims of the debtor pursuant to Article 626 of Spanish Insolvency
Act.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75%
of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) uncapped haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such
refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they
oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement;
or (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium)
of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence
of the relevant debt for equity swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a
ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt
(datio pro soluto).

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of the specially privileged secured claims
of nonparticipating or dissenting creditors in the amount covered by their security interest
(valued in accordance with the rules set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act), when the agreement
has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least
80% of the value of all the specially privileged secured claims of the debtor.


-----

_Liquidation_

Failure to obtain the approval of a composition agreement or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to
liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a composition agreement has been
approved, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations
undertaken after the approval of such composition agreement. Additionally, in such case, if the debtor
does not file a petition for liquidation while the composition agreement is in force, any creditor may file
such petition based on Article 407.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Therefore, the company will be aimed
at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due
and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits.

The insolvency trustee will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the
insolvency court. The insolvency trustee is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one
year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a different
insolvency trustee pursuant to Article 427 of Spanish Insolvency Act.

_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_

Article 465.6 of the Spanish Insolvency Act also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at
any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied
by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations
regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that Article 465.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act foresees the termination of the
insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay postinsolvency debt, as long as no
future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment
of the proceeding as guilty.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to insolvency claw back action, the insolvency administrator and any
creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the
debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is
performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in
any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following
requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

   - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place
after such debt was created;

   - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

  - such act was fraudulent;

  - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

  - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw back actions where the
subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil
Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers
for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or
whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered
fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (i.e. it cannot be
rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption
(i.e. it is a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor (or any other
debts that may be owed to other creditors). Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the
actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor.


-----

If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the
third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages if it is proved that such third party incurred in
willful misconduct when entering into the fraudulent agreement with the debtor. In any other case (i.e. if it
is proved that the third party acted in good faith and was not aware of the debtor’s fraudulent intention) it
will be the person who has actually and consciously caused the damage to the creditor who will have to
reimburse the corresponding amount.

The deadline to file a rescission action expires after four years as from the date when the claim could
have been filed.

**_Limitation on validity and enforcement of guarantees granted by any Spanish subsidiary._**

Under Spanish law, personal claims may become time-barred (5 years since the obligation becomes
enforceable being the general term established for obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the
Spanish Civil Code) or may be or become subject to the defense of setoff or counterclaim. In addition,
article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor
without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the
original term, although case law has established exceptions where the extension benefits both the debtor
and the guarantor).

A guarantee such as the guarantee granted by the Spanish Guarantors will be null if the obligations it
secures are declared null. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be
required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that
are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor.

The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of
a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be
enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts
will in any event be subject to:

   - the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

   - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions);

  - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), setoff (unless validly waived),
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, statute of limitations, undue
influence, fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim; and

  - the obligations under guarantees granted by the Spanish Guarantor in the form of a sociedad
_anónima shall (i) not extend to any obligation incurred by any company of the group for the_
purposes of (a) acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or
shares representing the share capital of the holding company of such Spanish Guarantor (or, in
case of private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), also shares
representing the share capital of any entity of its group); or (b) refinancing a previous debt incurred
by any company of the group for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such
Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of the holding company of such
Spanish Guarantor (or, in case of private limited liability companies (sociedades de
responsabilidad limitada), also shares representing the share capital of any entity of its group),
and shall (ii) be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by a Spanish Guarantor to the extent
that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 (for
Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for the Spanish private
limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada) of the Spanish Companies
Act, and, in no case, can any of the Guarantees or security interests given by a Spanish Guarantor
secure repayment of the above-mentioned funds.

For the purposes of the paragraph above, a reference to a “holding company” of a Spanish Guarantor
shall mean the company which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish
Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that
one company has a dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in section
1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) are met.


-----

**United States**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States, have their registered offices
in the United States or currently have, or may in the future have, property located in the United States
(each such Guarantor, a “U.S. Provider”). Insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in respect
of one or more of the U.S. Providers in the United States. U.S. law would then govern those proceedings.
A voluntary bankruptcy case may be commenced by us in respect of a U.S. Provider, or an involuntary
bankruptcy case could be commenced by certain unsecured creditors of a U.S. Provider, in each case as
provided under title 11 of the United States Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”). The Issuers and direct
or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuers that are not U.S. Providers may also be eligible to be debtors in
cases under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code where, among other things, they have now or later acquired
property located in the United States.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, under certain
circumstances:

(i) the issuance of the Note Guarantees by the U.S. Providers could be avoided or set aside;

(ii) the holders of the Notes could be required to repay certain amounts received in connection with
a Note Guarantee;

(iii) claims in respect of such obligations or liens could be subordinated to some or all of the other
debts and other liabilities of a U.S. Provider; and

(iv) the right of a security trustee to repossess and dispose of collateral, if any, of a U.S. Provider
upon an event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes will be governed by U.S.
bankruptcy law if such U.S. Provider commences U.S. bankruptcy proceedings before such
repossession or disposal occurs.

_Federal and State Insolvency Proceedings_

U.S. Providers may be subject to federal bankruptcy laws under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or applicable
state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a
debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code
provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating
to: (a) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of “adequate protection” to secured
creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of property, standards for obtaining credit
and the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (b) creditors and claims, including filing proofs of
claim, priority and allowance of claims, rights of secured creditors and subordination of claims;
(c) provisions relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the
estate and turnover and avoidance actions; and (d) liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code; reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and ancillary and crossborder
insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the
debtor’s assets by a trustee. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to
rehabilitate their businesses and work out their obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor in
a chapter 11 case typically remains in control of its assets and continues to operate its business during
the course of the bankruptcy case. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases are a frequently utilized
alternative to chapter 7 liquidations, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a
case under chapter 7 might prove prohibitively expensive or in an instance when a debtor expects to sell
all or substantially all of its assets. Because bankruptcy proceedings tend to be fact specific and vary
case by case and because U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers,
a detailed summary of all of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or of potential outcomes in a
U.S. bankruptcy case that could impact the Notes, collateral (if any) or the Notes Guarantees is not
contained herein.

With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit
of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms and/or dissolution mechanisms), the
effects and extent of these proceedings are factspecific, vary from state to state and require an
examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein. To the
extent more information is required, potential investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency
professional familiar with U.S. and the applicable state insolvency laws.

_Delay and risks associated in a federal bankruptcy proceeding_

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against any
U.S. Provider, it is likely that delays would occur in enforcing the Notes Guarantees or any collateral
granted by the bankrupt U.S. Provider, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying
general principles of equity. Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could
result in the impairment of rights include, but are not limited to:

   - the “automatic stay” (i.e. creditor moratorium);

   - avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtorinpossession;

   - substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities;

   - limitations on collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees;

  - avoidance of fraudulent transfers by a trustee or debtorinpossession; and

   - forced restructuring of the obligations of bankrupt company including obligations under the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and
extension of maturity dates, over the objections of holders of the Notes.

As an initial matter, the commencement of a bankruptcy case creates an automatic stay, applicable to all
creditors, of all litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims, enforce existing liens
or impose new liens, subject to limited exceptions. The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11
debtor time to reorganize and the chapter 7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly
fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a
debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts. Among other things, the automatic stay prohibits
(a) all collection efforts by creditors, (b) the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or
property of the estate, (c) any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and
(d) the setoff of prepetition debts owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic
stay ordinarily does not bar suits against nondebtor guarantors or coobligors, nor does it enjoin payment
under a letter of credit issued by a bank in favor of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Applicable federal
bankruptcy laws generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for
unsecured or “undersecured” claims.

_Fraudulent transfer issues_

Under Section 544 and/or 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or voidable transactions laws (collectively, “U.S. Fraudulent Transfer
**Laws”), the incurrence of obligations under the Note Guarantees or grant of security interests in the**
Collateral by any U.S. Provider could be avoided if, among other things, a court determined that at the
time the U.S. Provider entered into the Note Guarantees (or, in some jurisdictions, when payment
becomes due under a relevant Note Guarantee) or granted the security interests in Collateral, such U.S.
Provider (i) incurred the obligations under the Note Guarantee or granted security interests in collateral (if
any) with actual intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for incurring such obligations or such security interests, in
the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

   - such U.S. Provider was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of obligation
under the Note Guarantee or the grant of security interests in collateral;

   - the incurrence of obligations under the Note Guarantee or grant of security interests in collateral
left such U.S. Provider with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on our or its business;
or

   - such U.S. Provider intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as they mature.

A U.S. court would likely find that a U.S. Provider did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the incurrence of obligations under a Note Guarantee or the grant of security interests
in Collateral if such U.S. Provider did not benefit directly or indirectly from the same. Given that the Note
Guarantees furnished by the U.S. Providers are upstream guarantees, there is a risk that a U.S. court
may determine that one or more of the U.S. Providers did not receive reasonably equivalent value in
return for entering into the Note Guarantees and granting security interests in collateral.


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the
law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Provider would be
considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including probable contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable
value of all its assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency
determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. In an
evidentiary ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered
insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the transferor
knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities
that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of
the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the
principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is
solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be
a fraudulent transfer.

If the Note Guarantees were avoided or limited under U.S. Fraudulent Transfer Laws or other laws, any
claim you may make against the relevant U.S. Provider in relation to amounts payable in connection with
the Notes, the Note Guarantees, or any collateral would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance
or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by U.S. Provider
in connection with any such avoidance or limitation.

By their terms, the Note Guarantees of each U.S. Provider will limit that U.S. Provider’s liability under the
relevant Note Guarantee to the maximum amount it can pay without the Note Guarantee being deemed
a fraudulent transfer. However, these provisions contained in the Note Guarantees may not be effective to
protect the guarantees from being avoided under U.S. Fraudulent Transfer Laws, or may reduce a U.S.
Provider’s payment obligations to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee of the Notes issued
hereby worthless.

In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy, claims in respect of liens
or obligations evidenced by the Note Guarantees or any collateral may, in certain circumstances, be
subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_Preference issues_

Any payment made or pledge of collateral to a creditor on account of preexisting debt in favor of only
certain creditors might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in
bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is
insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge allows the pledgee to receive a greater recovery than it
would otherwise receive in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of
the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer
period.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement dated June 29, 2021, the Issuer
has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
the Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time
to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to
withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has agreed, subject to
certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided
under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer that are substantially
similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the
date that is 45 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
sold within the United States except in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in
this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Purchase Agreement, it will not offer or sell
the Notes as part of their distribution at any time within the United States, and it will have sent to each
dealer to which it sells Notes a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and
sales of the Notes within the United States. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to
them by Regulation S.

The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that they have:

  - only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

   - complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by them in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We intend to list the Notes
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit them for trading on the Euro MTF
Market thereof; however, we cannot assure that such listing will be maintained.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A Distributor
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without
prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in accordance with MiFID II, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID


-----

II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.
This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes described herein
in any Member State will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
_Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No_
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes described herein in the UK will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available, and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available, in Belgium to “consumers” (consumenten/consommateurs) within the
meaning of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit
_économique), as amended from time to time._

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Issuer and each
Guarantor has also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities
or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those
liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure that any market for the Notes will
develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time
or at a price which will be favorable to you.

The Stabilizing Manager, on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing
transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a
selling concession from a broker or dealer when Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are
purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging,
fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering,

creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in marketmaking transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or
maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The
Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Group’s Indebtedness, the Notes and Guarantees—There is no_
_established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to_
_sell them”._

These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after
the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are
commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and
60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-thecounter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, investment banking, financial advisory, M&A advisory, investment
management, principal investment, commercial lending (including but not limited to supplier financing or
letters of credit), hedging, real estate assets valuation, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided or are currently providing,
and may in the future provide, commercial lending (including but not limited to supplier financing or letters
of credit), investment banking, hedging, consulting, M&A advisory and financial advisory services to the
Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates for which the Initial Purchasers have received, and in the future
may receive, customary fees and expenses. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers (or their
affiliates) are lenders to (including, the borrowings under the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities and/or
the Existing Bilateral Facility Agreement) and/or have outstanding hedging agreements with companies
in our Group, and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering as a result of repayment of
existing debt as described in “Use of Proceeds”. Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or their affiliates) are
mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders to the Issuer under the New Syndicated Facilities Agreement
and may receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or
their affiliates) may also enter into new hedging agreements with us in connection with the Offering.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. In the ordinary course
of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and
such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its
subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in
such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the
Notes.

 STATUTORY AUDITOR’S REPORT ON REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2021

Ontex Group NV
Korte Keppestraat 23
9230 EREMBODEGEM

**To the Board of Directors**

**Review Report of the Statutory Auditor on Interim Financial Information**

_Introduction_

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Ontex Group NV
and its subsidiaries as of 31 March 2021 and the related consolidated income statement, the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the 3 month period then ended, as well as the
explanatory notes. The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the
condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the
European Union. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Interim Financial Information based on
our review.

_Scope of Review_

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements
2410 “Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity” (ISRE
2410). A review on interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
As such our review does not provide the assurance that we will identify all significant matters that we
might have discovered during an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

_Conclusion_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the attached
accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have not been prepared, in all
material respects in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial reporting as adopted by the European
Union.

###### 6. NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 6.1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Ontex Group NV (the ‘Group’ or ‘Ontex’) for the first three months
ended March 31, 2021 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board on [●].

**6.1.1.** **Legal status**

Ontex Group is a limited-liability company incorporated in the form of a naamloze vennootschap under Belgian law. Ontex Group
has its registered office at Korte Keppestraat 21, 9320 Erembodegem (Aalst), Belgium. The shares of Ontex Group are listed on
the regulated market of Euronext Brussels.

###### 6.2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

**6.2.1.** **Basis of preparation**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the first three months ended March 31, 2021 have been
prepared in accordance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted by the European Union. They do not include all the
information required for the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 of Ontex Group NV, that can be found on
the website: http://www.ontexglobal.com.

The amounts in this document are presented in € millions, unless noted otherwise. In most of the tables of this report, amounts
are shown in € million for reasons of transparency. This may give rise to rounding differences in the tables presented in the report.

This report has been prepared in Dutch and translated into English. In the case of discrepancies between the two versions, the
Dutch version will prevail.

A summary of the significant accounting policies can be found in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2020 of Ontex Group NV that can be found in the Integrated Annual Report 2020 on the website
(http://www.ontexglobal.com), from page 109 through page 118. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the
periods presented.

The accounting policies used to prepare the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period from January 1,
2021 to March 31, 2021 are consistent with those applied in the audited consolidated financial statement for the year ended
December 31, 2020 of Ontex Group NV.

**IFRS accounting standards to be adopted as from 2021**

The following relevant new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the first
time for the financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021:

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (effective January 1,
2021). These amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting after the reform of an interest rate benchmark,
including its replacement with alternative benchmark rates.

Amendments to IFRS 16 – Covid 19-Related Rent Concessions (effective June 1, 2020): If certain conditions are met, the
amendments would permit lessees, as a practical expedient, not to assess whether particular covid-19-related rent concessions
are lease modifications. Instead, lessees that apply the practical expedient would account for those rent concessions as if they
were not lease modifications.

The above-mentioned standards did not have an impact on the financial statements.


-----

**Relevant IFRS accounting pronouncements to be adopted as from 2021 onwards**

A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and annual improvement cycles have been published and are
mandatory for the first time for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and have not been early adopted. Those
which may be the most relevant to the Ontex Group’s consolidated financial statements are set out below.

Amendments to IFRS 16 – _Covid 19-Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021_ (effective April 1, 2021, but not yet
endorsed in EU): If certain conditions are met, the amendments would permit lessees, as a practical expedient, not to assess
whether particular covid-19-related rent concessions are lease modifications. Instead, lessees that apply the practical expedient
would account for those rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications.

Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (effective January 1, 2023, but not yet endorsed in
EU): The amendments provide a more general approach to the classification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the contractual
arrangements in place at the reporting date.

Amendments to IAS 1 and Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective January 1, 2023, but not yet
endorsed in EU). The amendments provide more guidelines on which accounting policies to disclose in the financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective January 1, 2023, but not yet endorsed in EU). The
amendments clarify the distinction between accounting policies and accounting estimates.

Amendments to IAS 16 – Proceeds before Intended Use (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments
prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while
bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Amendments to IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in
EU): The amendments clarify the costs a company should include as the cost of fulfilling a contract when assessing whether a
contract is onerous.

Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in EU): The annual improvements package
includes the following minor amendments: Subsidiary as a First-time Adopter (Amendment to IFRS 1); Fees in the ‘10 per cent’
Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities (Amendment to IFRS 9); Lease Incentives (Amendment to Illustrative Example 13
of IFRS 16); Taxation in Fair Value Measurements (Amendment to IAS 41).

**6.2.2.** **Measurement in the consolidated financial statements**

Revenues and costs that are incurred unevenly during the financial year are anticipated or deferred in the interim report only if it
would be also appropriate to anticipate or defer such revenues and costs at the end of the financial year.

Income tax expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate
expected for the full financial year.

**6.2.3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The preparation of interim financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in
applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

###### 6.3. OPERATING SEGMENTS

According to IFRS 8, reportable operating segments are identified based on the “management approach”. This approach stipulates
external segment reporting based on the Group’s internal organizational and management structure and on internal financial
reporting to the chief operating decision maker. The Group’s activities are in one segment, “Hygienic Disposable Products”. There
are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate. The chief operating decision maker, the Board of
Directors, reviews the operating results and operating plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis.
Therefore, the Group operates as one segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about product sales and geographic areas are
presented below:

**6.3.1.** **Information by Division**

**First 3 months**
**in € million** **2021** **2020**
Europe 191.7 250.1
AMEAA 178.9 213.5
Healthcare 109.1 110.6
**Total revenue** **479.7** **574.2**

**6.3.2.** **Information by product group**

The key product categories are:

 - Babycare products, principally baby diapers, baby pants and, to a lesser extent, wet wipes;

 - Feminine care products, such as sanitary towels, panty liners and tampons;

 - Adult incontinence products, such as adult pants, adult diapers, incontinence towels and bed protection.

**First 3 months**
**in € million** **2021** **2020**
Babycare 254.1 328.3
Adult Incontinence 169.8 177.1
Femcare 47.3 62.0
Other 8.5 6.8
**Total revenue** **479.7** **574.2**

**6.3.3.** **Information by geographic area**

The organizational structure of the Group and its system of internal information indicates that the main source of geographical
risks results from the location of its customers (destination of its sales) and not the physical location of its assets (origin of its
sales). The location of Group’s customers is accordingly the geographical segmentation criterion and is defined as below:

 - Western Europe

 - Eastern Europe

 - Americas

 - Rest of the World

**First 3 months**
**in € million** **2021** **2020**
Western Europe 223.0 274.8
Americas 138.4 160.1
Rest of the World 60.8 76.0
Eastern Europe 57.5 63.3
**Total revenue** **479.7** **574.2**

The activity of Ontex Group is not subject to significant seasonality throughout the year. Therefore, the additional disclosure of
financial information for the 12-month period ended on the interim reporting date, encouraged in IAS 34.21, is not provided.


-----

###### 6.4. GOODWILL

The movement in goodwill relates to exchange differences (loss of € 2.1 million).

The Group identifies the following cash-generating units:

    - Europe

    - Healthcare

    - MEAA (Middle East, Africa and Asia)

    - Americas

Annual impairment reviews are performed during the fourth quarter of each year for all CGUs. These reviews compare the carrying
value of each CGU with the recoverable amount of the CGU’s assets calculated using a discounted cash flow model. If the
recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the income
statement.

Due to the current economic circumstances and the COVID-pandemic, the Group has performed an updated impairment test as
per March 31, 2021. The outcome of these goodwill impairment tests did not result in any impairment loss.

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, demand and competition in the
markets where we operate, product offerings, product mix and pricing, raw materials availability and cost, direct and indirect
expenses, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditure and working capital, etc. as reflected in Ontex’ financial budgets
and strategic plans, as well as discount rates. The discount rates used are summarized here below:

**In %** **March 31, 2021** **December 31, 2020**
**Pre-tax discount rate**
Europe 7.0% 5.7%
Healthcare 6.2% 5.3%
Middle East, Africa and Asia 11.3% 11.2%
Americas 8.0% 7.4%

A sensitivity analysis indicates that the recoverable amount of Europe, Healthcare, Middle East Africa and Asia (MEAA) and
Americas would be equal to their carrying amount if the pre-tax discount rates of the CGUs were 7.8%, 21.4%, 14.5% and 9.3%,
respectively and all other variables kept constant.

Cash flows beyond the period of the strategic plan are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.0% for Europe, 1.5% for
Healthcare, 3.0% for MEAA and 3.6% for Americas. These same percentages are used as perpetual growth rates. The growth
rates have been determined by management but do not exceed the current market expectations in which the four CGUs are
currently operating. Should the growth rate for any of the CGUs decrease by 30%, no impairment would need to be recognized.

Should the estimated operating margins decrease by 10%, no impairment would be recognized.

###### 6.5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The Group acquired intangible assets for a total amount of € 2.1 million, mainly relating to IT implementation costs (2020: € 2.4
million relating to IT implementation costs) and capitalized development costs.

The amortization charge for the period amounts to € 2.7 million (2020: € 2.4 million).

Most significant movement of the period relates to exchange differences (loss of € 2.3 million).

###### 6.6. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Separate additions to property, plant and equipment represent mainly investments in capacity extension, investments in
innovation, investments to improve the efficiency and IT investments for a total amount of € 11.1 million (2020: € 15.3 million).

Furthermore, property, plant and equipment were disposed of for a carrying amount of € 0.1 million (2020: € 0.2 million).

The depreciation charge for the period amounts to € 12.7 million (2020: € 12.7 million). No impairment losses have been
recognized in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021.

The Group has contracted expenditures for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment at March 31, 2021 of € 9.7 million.


-----

###### 6.7. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS

**6.7.1.** **Right-of-use assets**

The Group entered into new lease contracts for a total amount of € 2.4 million, mainly relating to furniture and vehicles (2020: €
1.4 million).

Furthermore, modifications to lease contracts have an impact of € 1.1 million.

The depreciation expense for the period amounts to € 6.4 million (2020: € 6.9 million).

Remaining movement of the period relates to exchange differences.

**6.7.2.** **Lease liabilities**

The lease liabilities are included in the interest-bearing debts and amount to € 109.4 million under non-current liabilities and €
21.3 million under current liabilities (2020: € 111.0 million as non-current and € 21.7 million as current).

###### 6.8. NET DEBT 

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt position. The Group’s net debt position is calculated by adding all short
and long-term interest-bearing debts and by deducting the available short-term liquidity.

The net debt positions of the Group for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are as follows:

**December 31,**
**in € million** **March 31, 2021**

**2020**
Non-current interest-bearing debts 863.6 911.4
Current interest-bearing debts 209.2 366.3
Cash and cash equivalents (227.4) (430.1)
**Total net debt position** **845.4** **847.6**
LTM Adjusted EBITDA 219.1 235.6
**Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio** **3.86** **3.60**

In the first quarter of 2021, the Company has reimbursed the syndicated revolving credit facility of € 210 million which was drawn
down to provide financial flexibility in the context of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-crisis.

###### 6.9. PROVISIONS

**6.9.1.** **Restructuring**

In 2021, the Group has recognized additional restructuring provisions in the context of the redistribution/re-allocation of production
capabilities and the strategic review of the geographical footprint of the Group, launched at year-end 2020. As such, the Company
decided to downsize some production capacity which has been announced to the relevant stakeholders and resulted in the
recognition of a additional restructuring provision (€ 3.7 million). The provision mainly includes termination benefits. The additional
provisions have been recognized in ‘Non-recurring income and expenses’, under the heading ‘Restructuring’.

**6.9.2.** **Legal claims**

The Group is involved in a number of environmental, contractual, product liability, intellectual property, employment and other
claims and disputes incidental to our business.

On September 2, 2014, Ontex received a notification that the Spanish Competition Authorities (CNMC) opened infringement
proceedings against 15 companies in the sector (including three subsidiaries of the Company: Ontex Es Holdco, S.A., Ontex
Peninsular, S.A.U. and Ontex ID, S.A.U.) with respect to alleged conduct of fixing prices and other commercial conditions in the
Spanish market for heavy adult incontinence products. On May 26, 2016, following the investigation, the CNMC issued its decision.
In its decision it has found eight companies, including Ontex' Spanish subsidiaries guilty of being part of a cartel. For its
involvement from 1999 to 2014, Ontex was fined € 5.2 million. Ontex initiated an appeal against the decision and this appeal is
pending. As per December 31, 2016, a provision amounting to € 5.2 million has been accounted for. The provision has not been
adjusted per March 31, 2021.

COFECE, the Mexican antitrust authority, is conducting an investigation in our industry. To the best of the Group’s knowledge,
the facts under investigation relate to periods prior to its acquisition of Grupo PI Mabe, S.A. de C.V. (“Mabe”). Ontex and Mabe
have been proactively and fully cooperating with COFECE in the investigation and intend to continue to do so.


-----

Based on the facts and circumstances known to it and in light of the contractual terms of the Mabe acquisition, the Group does
not expect the investigation to result in a net financial cost to it.

The Group currently believes that the disposition of all other claims and disputes, individually or in the aggregate, should not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

###### 6.10. NON-RECURRING INCOME AND EXPENSES

**First 3 months**
**in € million** **2021** **2020**
Restructuring (5.6) (5.3)
Acquisition-related expenses (1.0) (0.0)
**Income and expenses related to changes to Group structure** **(6.6)** **(5.3)**
Impairment of assets (1.3) Litigation and legal claims (0.4) (1.3)
Other 0.9 0.1
**Income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations** **(0.8)** **(1.3)**
**Total non-recurring income and expenses** **(7.4)** **(6.6)**

Items classified under the heading non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are considered by management not
to relate to items in the ordinary course of activities of the Company. The Group has adopted this classification to allow a better
understanding of its recurring financial performance.

These items are presented as follows in the consolidated income statement as follows:

 - income and expenses related to changes to Group structure; and

 - income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations

**6.10.1. Income and expenses related to changes to Group structure**

**Restructuring**

In 2021, the cost relates to the restructuring expenses in the context of the redistribution/re-allocation of production capabilities
and the strategic review of the geographical footprint of the Group. As such, the Company decided to downsize some production
capacity which has been announced to the relevant stakeholders and resulted in the recognition of a restructuring provision (€ 3.7
million).

The expenses recognized in 2020 related to the Group reorganization and comprehensive transformation plan, Transform2Grow
(T2G), announced in May 2019, which aimed to step-change the operational efficiency and commercial practices. The costs
recognized in 2020 relate to in-depth assessments of the different processes and the start of the implementation of different
projects to increase the operational efficiency. Total expenses related to the execution of the projects amounted to € 4.9 million
in 2020.

**6.10.2. Income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations**

**Impairment of assets**

The impairment loss is a non-cash item and relates in 2021 mainly to the impairment recognized on some intangible assets..

**Litigations**

The expenses recognized relate to costs incurred in the context of various on-going litigations.

###### 6.11. EARNINGS PER SHARE

In accordance with IAS 33, the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to
ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The number
of shares used for 2020 was 80,756,824, which is the weighted average number of shares for 2020. The number of shares used
for 2021 was 80,839,869, which is the weighted average number of shares for 2021.

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent
(after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.


-----

In case of Ontex Group NV, no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders. The table below reflects
the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

**First 3 months**
**in € million** **2021** **2020**
**Basic earnings**

Profit from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent 7.7 24.1
Adjustment dilution - **Profit from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent, after dilution effect** **7.7** **24.1**

**First 3 months**
**Number of Shares** **2021** **2020**
Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period 80,839,869 80,756,824
Dilution 156,125 161,215

**First 3 months**
**Earnings per share (€)** **2021** **2020**
Basic earnings per share 0.10 0.30
Diluted earnings per share 0.10 0.30

A weighted average number of 2,258,360 options were not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share as they
were out-of-the-money at the end of the first quarter of 2021 (2020: 1,031,068 options).

###### 6.12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

**6.12.1. Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost**

For all financial instruments not measured at fair value in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31,
2021, the fair value of those financial instruments is not significantly different from the ones published in Note 7.5 of the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

As mentioned in Note 6.8 above, the Company has reimbursed the syndicated revolving credit facility of € 210 million in the first
quarter of 2021 for which the fair value approximated the carrying amount per December 31, 2020.

**6.12.2. Financial instruments measured at fair value**

The financial instruments measured at fair value in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position are the derivative
instruments, such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. These are presented in the consolidated
statement of financial position under the headings “Derivative financial assets” and “Derivative financial liabilities”.

The fair value of the derivatives is based on level 2 inputs as defined under IFRS 7.27, meaning inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices), which is consistent with the measurement in
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

###### 6.13. CONTINGENCIES

The Group is involved in a number of environmental, contractual, product liability, intellectual property, employment and other
claims and disputes incidental to our business.

The Group currently believes that the disposition of the claims and disputes, individually or in aggregate, should not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

###### 6.14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

There are no substantial related party transactions during the first quarter of 2021.

The remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and key management is determined on an annual basis, for which
reason no further details are included in this interim report.


-----

###### 6.15. EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD 

No significant events occurred after the end of the reporting date which would affect the information mentioned in these
consolidated financial statements.

###### 6.16. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Alternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in the financial communication of the Group since management believes
that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of
performance and liquidity. The alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results, our performance or our liquidity under IFRS.

**6.16.1. Non-recurring income and expenses**

Income and expenses classified under the heading “non-recurring income and expenses” are those items that are considered by
management not to relate to transactions, projects and adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities taking place in the ordinary
course of activities of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses are presented separately, due to their size or nature, so
as to allow users of the consolidated financial statements of the Company to get a better understanding of the normalized
performance of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses relate to:

 - acquisition-related expenses;

 - changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context of business combinations;

 - changes to the Group structure, business restructuring costs, including costs related to the liquidation of subsidiaries and the
closure, opening or relocations of factories;

 - impairment of assets and major litigations.

Non-recurring income and expenses of the Group for the three first months ended March 31 are composed of the following items
presented in the consolidated income statement and can be reconciled in note 6.9.:

 - income/(expenses) related to changes to Group structure; and

 - income/(expenses) related to impairments and major litigations.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

**ONTEX GROUP NV**
**April 22[nd] 2021**

**STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF ONTEX GROUP NV ON THE**
**CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated accounts of Ontex Group
NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”, “Ontex”). This report includes our report on the consolidated accounts,
as well as the other legal and regulatory requirements. This forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 25 May 2020, following the proposal formulated by the
board of directors and following the recommendation by the audit committee Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022. We have performed the statutory
audit of the Company’s consolidated accounts for 7 consecutive years.

###### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

**Unqualified opinion**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2020, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information,
and which is characterised by a consolidated statement of financial position total of EUR 3,067.0 million and a profit for the year
of EUR 54.0 million.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and consolidated financial position as
at 31 December 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

**Basis for unqualified opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium. Furthermore, we
have applied the International Standards on Auditing as approved by the IAASB which are applicable to the year-end and which
are not yet approved at the national level. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory
_auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts”_ section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium,
including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information necessary for performing
our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**(1) Impairment of goodwill**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex carries a significant value of goodwill on the balance sheet amounting to EUR 1,106.7 million as detailed in disclosure 7.9.
Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the
amount of goodwill for impairment at least annually. We consider this matter to be of most significance because of the complexity
of the assessment process and significant judgments in respect of assumptions about the future results of the business and the
discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. The most important assumptions relate to the discount rate, growth rates of
revenue and operating margin. We focused on the goodwill of the Cash Generating Units (further CGU) Americas and Europe
because they are most sensitive to changes in key assumptions.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged if the goodwill impairment test was performed at the lowest CGU level at which the goodwill is monitored. We
challenged the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We found
that the projected cash flow for 2021 were consistent with the Board approved budgets, which were subject to timely oversight


-----

and challenge by the Directors. We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of
business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the cash flows after 2021 we
critically assessed and checked the assumptions related to the long-term growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts
and historical growth rates. We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the
Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the calculation method used and
the accuracy thereof. We compared operating margin, working capital- and CAPEX percentage with past actuals. We challenged
the adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these
assumptions would need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered. We discussed the likelihood of such a
movement with management. We included valuation specialists in our team to assist us with these procedures. We also assessed
the adequacy of the disclosures (Note 7.9 and Note 7.4.4) in the financial statements.

**Our results**

From our sensitivity analysis, we found the likelihood of changes resulting in impairment losses to be unlikely.

**(2) Valuation of deferred taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to tax**
**losses carried forward**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex has recognised a deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability of respectively EUR 24.9 million and EUR 29.2 million. EUR
123.8 million deferred tax asset position was not recognised, as disclosed in Note 7.19. In 2020 Ontex wrote-off EUR 4.2 million
deferred tax assets on previously recognised tax losses and EUR 7.3 million deferred tax asset positions on tax losses of 2020
were not recognised as disclosed in Note 7.27. The valuation of the deferred tax positions at Ontex involved significant judgement,
more specifically in the determination of the recognition of deferred tax assets related to tax losses carried forward. The estimation
of the future taxable basis is highly judgemental as well as the assessment of the impact of tax laws and regulations, tax planning
action and strategies, rulings and transfer pricing. Because of all the aforementioned reasons, we found this key audit matter to
be of most significance for our audit.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged the assumptions made to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to tax losses carried forward and
the timing of the reversal of deferred tax positions. During our procedures, we used amongst others budgets, forecasts and tax
laws and in addition we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s assumptions. An important management judgement
was the period over which taxable profits can be reliably estimated and consequently, no deferred tax assets are recognised for
tax losses used in any period beyond. We verified that the deferred tax position was calculated at the enacted tax rate for the year
in which the deferred tax position is expected to reverse.

We also assessed the adequacy and completeness of the Company’s disclosure included in Note 7.4.2, 7.19 and 7.27 in respect
of deferred taxes.

**Our results**

We found management’s judgements in respect of the Group’s deferred tax positions to be consistent and in line with our
expectations.

**(3) Accounting for accruals for sales incentives and purchase related incentives**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Trade discounts and volume rebates related to both sales and purchases are subject to judgmental estimates and assessments
of the impact of commercial negotiations which take place after year-end. The impact of commercial negotiations is material and
hence of most significance for our audit. Ontex calculates an estimate of final incentives based on the information available until
the financial statements are established. Incentives related to sales are reported as deduction of Group’s revenue. Purchase
discounts are recorded as a deduction of the initial purchase.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We have agreed the discount percentages or lump sum payments to underlying customer agreements, we recalculated the accrual
and challenged the estimated impact of commercial negotiations taking into account the results. For a sample of supplier rebates,
we obtained external confirmations of the bonus to be received. We also performed back-testing on the accruals per 31 December
2019. We reviewed credit notes and other adjustments to trade receivables and trade payables after 31 December 2020 as part
of our work around subsequent events.

**Our results**

Our work did not identify findings that are significant for the financial statements as a whole.

**Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and fair view in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements
applicable in Belgium, and for such internal control as the board of directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


-----

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the board of directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the audit of the consolidated
accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or
effectiveness of the board of directors’ current or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of
the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the board of directors’ are described below.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout
the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and

perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the

circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control;

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related

disclosures made by the board of directors;

Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit

evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether

the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within

the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit
of the consolidated accounts of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

###### OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

**Responsibilities of the board of directors**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts, the
separate report on non-financial information and the other information included in the annual report on the consolidated accounts.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities**

In the context of our engagement and in accordance with the Belgian standard which is complementary to the International
Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the directors’ report

In 2010, Ontex was acquired by funds managed by GSCP and TPG. In 2011, Ontex opened two additional production facilities,
one in Australia and one in Russia, and acquired Lille Healthcare, a company operating in the adult incontinence market in France.
In 2013, Ontex acquired Serenity, a company operating in the adult incontinence market in Italy, and opened a production facility
in Pakistan.

the needs of African families.

In February 2019, Ontex opened a new production plant in Radomsko, Poland to support its Central European business.

###### 7. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 7.1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

**7.1.1. Introduction**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the period from January 1, 2020 to December
31, 2020 are consistent with those applied in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019
of Ontex Group NV. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.

**7.1.2. Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of the Ontex Group NV for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared in
compliance with IFRS (“International Financial Reporting Standards”) as adopted by the European Union. These include all IFRS
standards and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective as at December 31, 2020. The new standards, amendments to standards
and interpretations that are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning January 1, 2020, did not have a significant
impact. No new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations were early adopted.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial
instruments for which fair value is used (such as derivative instruments).

These financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and on the assumption that the entity is in going concern and will
continue in operation in the foreseeable future.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Group accounting policies. The areas involving a higher
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in note 7.4.

**IFRS accounting standards to be adopted as from 2020 and onwards**

The following relevant new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and endorsed by the European
Union and are mandatory for the first time for the financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020:

Amendments to IFRS 3 – _Definition of a Business (effective January 1, 2020): The amendments aim to assist companies to_
determine whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets.

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material (effective January 1, 2020): The amendments clarify the definition of
“material” and to align the definition used in the Conceptual Framework and the standards.

The above-mentioned standards did not have an impact on the financial statements.

**Relevant IFRS accounting pronouncements to be adopted as from 2021 onwards**

A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and annual improvement cycles have been published and are
mandatory for the first time for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and have not been early adopted. Those
which may be the most relevant to the Ontex Group’s consolidated financial statements are set out below, but are expected not
to have a significant impact on the Ontex’ consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (effective 01/01/2021).
These amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting after the reform of an interest rate benchmark, including
its replacement with alternative benchmark rates. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2021, with earlier application permitted.

Amendments to IFRS 16 – _Covid 19-Related Rent Concessions_ (effective June 1, 2020): If certain conditions are met, the
amendments would permit lessees, as a practical expedient, not to assess whether particular covid-19-related rent concessions
are lease modifications. Instead, lessees that apply the practical expedient would account for those rent concessions as if they
were not lease modifications.

Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (effective January 1, 2023, but not yet endorsed in
EU): The amendments provide a more general approach to the classification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the contractual
arrangements in place at the reporting date.

Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting policies
(effective January 1, 2023, but not yet endorsed in EU).

Amendments to IAS 16 – Proceeds before Intended Use (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments
prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while
bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Amendments to IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in
EU): The amendments clarify the costs a company should include as the cost of fulfilling a contract when assessing whether a
contract is onerous.


-----

Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (effective January 1, 2022, but not yet endorsed in EU): The annual improvements package
includes the following minor amendments: Subsidiary as a First-time Adopter (Amendment to IFRS 1); Fees in the ‘10 per cent’
Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities (Amendment to IFRS 9); Lease Incentives (Amendment to Illustrative Example 13
of IFRS 16); Taxation in Fair Value Measurements (Amendment to IAS 41).

**7.1.3. Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is established when the Group is exposed, or has the rights,
to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity
interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration agreement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at acquisition
date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.

The excess of the consideration of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.

**Transactions with non-controlling interests**

The Group treats the transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases
from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value
of the net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses on disposal to non-controlling interests are also recorded
in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value,
with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income
are reclassified to profit or loss.

**7.1.4. Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Separately recognized goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

The goodwill recognized in the statement of financial position is allocated to four Cash Generating Units (CGUs). These CGUs
are Europe, Healthcare, Middle East, Africa and Asia and Americas. They represent the lowest level within the entity at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

**7.1.5. Foreign currencies**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro,
which is the Group’s presentation currency.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income
statement.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to interest-bearing debts and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within ‘Net finance cost’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement
within ‘Other operating income/(expenses), net’.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. Items of income and expense are translated at the monthly average
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions), and equity


-----

items are translated at historical rates. The resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

The principal exchange rates that have been used are as follows:

**December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**

**Currency** **Closing Rate** **Av Rate Year** **Closing Rate** **Av Rate Year**
AUD 1.5896 1.6554 1.5995 1.6106

BRL 6.3735 5.8900 4.5157 4.4135

CZK 26.2420 26.4554 25.4080 25.6697

GBP 0.8990 0.8892 0.8508 0.8773

MXN 24.4160 24.5118 21.2202 21.5573

PLN 4.5597 4.4432 4.2568 4.2975

RUB 91.4671 82.6454 69.9563 72.4593

TRY 9.1131 8.0436 6.6843 6.3573

USD 1.2271 1.1413 1.1234 1.1196

**7.1.6. Intangible assets**

An intangible asset is recognized on the statement of financial position when the following conditions are met: (1) the asset is
identifiable, i.e. either separable (if it can be sold, transferred, licensed) or it results from contractual or legal rights; (2) it is probable
that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; (3) the Group can control the
resource; and (4) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets are carried at acquisition cost (including the costs directly attributable to the transaction) less any accumulated
amortizations and less any accumulated impairment losses.

Within the Group, internally generated intangibles represent IT projects and product/process development projects.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique projects controlled by the
Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

 it is technically feasible to complete the project so that it will be available for use

 management intends to complete the project and use or sell it

 there is an ability to use or sell the project

 it can be demonstrated how the project will generate probable future economic benefits

 adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the project are available,

and

 the expenditure attributable to the project during its development can be reliably measured.

The Group’s systems allow a reliable measure of expenses directly attributable to the different IT and product/process
development projects.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria above are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.

Externally acquired software is carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated amortization and less any accumulated
impairment loss.

Maintenance costs as well as the costs of minor upgrades whose objective is to maintain (rather than increase) the level of
performance of the asset are expensed as incurred.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and or production of a qualifying intangible asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.


-----

Intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life, using the straight-line method. The applicable useful
lives are:

**Intangible assets**
Brands 20 years

IT implementation costs 5 years

Capitalized development costs 3 to 5 years

Licenses 3 to 5 years

Acquired concessions, patents, know-how, and other similar rights 5 years

Amortization commences only when the asset is available for use.

**7.1.7. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment loss. Acquisition cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended
use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and/or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

Expenditure on repair and maintenance which serve only to maintain, but not increase, the value of fixed assets is charged to the
income statement. However, expenditure on major repair and major maintenance, which increases the future economic benefits
that will be generated by the fixed asset, is identified as a separate element of the acquisition cost. The cost of property, plant and
equipment is broken down into major components. These major components, which are replaced at regular intervals and
consequently have a useful life that is different from that of the fixed asset in which they are incorporated, are depreciated over
their specific useful lives. In the event of replacement, the component is replaced and removed from the statement of financial
position, and the new asset is depreciated up until the next major repair or maintenance.

The depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset, using the straight-line method. The
depreciable amount is the acquisition cost, less residual value, if any. The applicable useful lives are:

**Property, plant and equipment**
Land N/A
Land improvements and buildings 30 years
Plants, machinery and equipment 10 to 15 years
Furniture and vehicles 4 to 8 years
Other tangible assets 5 years
IT equipment 3 to 5 years

The useful life of the machines is reviewed regularly. Each time a significant upgrade is performed, such upgrade extends the
useful life of the machine. The cost of the upgrade is added to the carrying amount of the machine and the new carrying amount
is depreciated prospectively over the remaining estimated useful life of the machine.

**7.1.8. Leases**

The Group leases several properties, machinery, vehicles and IT equipment. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and
corresponding liability at the date of which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present
value of the following lease payments:

 fixed payments (less any lease incentives),

 variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate,

 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and

 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined, or the
Group’s incremental borrowing rate, i.e. the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with
a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included
in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease
liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.


-----

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the remaining
balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received,

 any initial direct costs, and

 an estimate of the costs related to the dismantling and removal of the underlying asset.

If it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the asset shall be depreciated on a straight-line basis
over its useful life (see property, plant and equipment above). In all other circumstances the asset is depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value items (mainly IT equipment and small office furniture)
to which the Group applies the recognition exemptions available in IFRS 16, lease payments are recognized on a straight-line
basis as an expense over the lease term.

Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to the use of the property (mainly warehouses). Variable
lease payments that depend on the use are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those
payments occurs.

**7.1.9. Impairment of non-financial assets, other than goodwill**

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization, but are
tested annually for impairment.

Other assets which are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value
in use.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the production costs, like raw materials, direct labor, and also the
indirect production costs (production overheads based on normal operating capacity). Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.

Spare parts held by the Group are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are expected to be used in more than one
period and if they are specific to a single machine. If they are not expected to be used in more than one period or if they can be
used on several machines, they are classified as inventory. For the spare parts classified as inventory, the Group uses write-down
rules based on the economic use of these spare parts.

**7.1.11. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For a sale to be highly probable, management
should be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan
should be initiated, the asset (or disposal group) should be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its current
fair value, the sale should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and actions required to
complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.

A disposal group is a group of assets to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, together as a group in a single transaction, and
liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The group includes goodwill acquired in
a business combination if the group is a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, or if it is an operation within
such a cash-generating unit.

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a noncontrolling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. Any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell is recognized as an


-----

impairment loss. Depreciation of such assets is discontinued as from their classification as held for sale. Prior period consolidated
statements of financial position are not restated to reflect the new classification of a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held
for sale.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which the Group has disposed of or which is classified as held for sale,
and which:

 represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

 is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

**7.1.12. Revenue recognition**

Ontex Group’s core activity is the sale of goods with as only performance obligation the delivery of goods. As such, the Group
recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.
The Group sells its products to its customers directly, through distributors or agents. This can result in a different moment to
recognize revenue. Following delivery to distributors, the distributor has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to
sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to
the goods.

Next to the sale of goods, distinct services – mainly customer training or customer assistance services – are rendered
predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer. Transportation (shipping) is not be
considered as a separate performance obligation as control over the goods is only transferred to the customer after the shipment.

Payment terms can differ depending on the customer, based on the credit risk and prior payment behavior of the customer. In
addition, the geographical location of the company and the customer have an effect on the payment terms. There are no significant
financing components in the transaction prices and the considerations are paid in cash.

Customer contracts include trade discounts or volume rebates, which are granted to the customer if the delivered quantities
exceed a certain threshold. In these cases, the transaction price includes a variable consideration. The effect of the variable
consideration on the transaction price is taken into account in revenue recognition by estimating the probability of the realization
of the discount or rebate for each contract. Furthermore, the estimated variable consideration is included in the transaction price
only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved (constraining the variable consideration).
Furthermore, the Group considers all payments made to customers and whether these are related to the revenue generated from
the customer.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because
only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

**7.1.13. Financial assets**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value and financial assets at amortized
cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the
cash flows. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell an asset.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of
financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets (such as loans, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents) are subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment if they are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all
fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on
initial recognition.

Trade and other receivables after and within one year are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized
cost, i.e. at the net present value of the receivable amount, using the effective interest rate method, less allowances for impairment.

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized
cost. For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

The amount of the allowance is deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the income statement within
‘Sales and marketing expenses’.


-----

Trade receivables are no longer recognized when (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the trade receivables have expired, (2)
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards related to the receivables.

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset,
the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the
financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity is recognized in profit or loss.

On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to repurchase part of a
transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to
recognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts
on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the
sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognized and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been
recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in
other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is no longer
recognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

**7.1.14. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of
financial position.

**7.1.15. Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (treasury
shares), the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the company until the shares are cancelled or
reissued. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.

Financial instruments, such as the Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs), are either classified as financial liabilities
or equity. The financial instrument is included in equity if, and only if, the instrument does not include a contractual obligation to
deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or liabilities under conditions that are potentially unfavorable
to the Group, and if the instrument will or may be settled in a fixed number of the Group’s own equity instruments.

**7.1.16. Government grants**

Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the assets to which they
relate and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

**7.1.17. Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are recorded as an expense in the income statement in the period in which the services have been
rendered. Any unpaid compensation is included in ‘Employee benefit liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.

**Post-employment benefits**

Group companies operate various pension schemes. Most of the schemes are unfunded. Some schemes are funded through
payments to insurance companies or pension funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined
benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit
plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit
that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.


-----

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. The net interest cost relating to the defined benefit plans is recognized
within financial expenses.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

**Long-term employee benefits**

Unfunded obligations arising from long-term benefits are provided for using the projected unit credit method.

**Termination benefits**

Early termination obligations are recognized as a liability when the Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ to terminating the
employment before the normal retirement date. The Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ when, and only when, it has a detailed
formal plan for the early termination without realistic possibility of withdrawal. Where such benefits are long term, they are
discounted using the same rate as above for defined benefit obligations.

**7.1.18. Share-based payments**

The Group operates an equity settled share-based compensation plan, consisting of stock options (hereafter ‘options’), restricted
stock units (‘RSU’) and performance stock units (‘PSU’). For grants of options, RSU’s and PSU’s, the fair value of the employee
services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted on the date of the grant. The Group
recognizes the fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the options as an expense and a corresponding
increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the options granted is determined using option
pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the share price at date of grant of the option, the risk-free
interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Vesting conditions
included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value except where those terms relate to market
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of shares or options included in the
measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately the amount recognized in the income statement reflects the
number of vested shares or options.

At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable
and recognizes the impact of revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to
equity over the remaining vesting period.

When the instruments are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share
capital (nominal value) and share premium.

The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the instruments is considered an integral part of the grant
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.

**7.1.19. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when (1) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (2) it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (3) the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
considering the class of obligations as a whole.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in
the provision due to passage of time is recognized as finance cost.

If the Group has an onerous contract, it will be recognized as a provision. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination
penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

A provision for restructuring is only recorded if the Group demonstrates a constructive obligation to restructure at the balance
sheet date. The constructive obligation should be demonstrated by: (a) a detailed formal plan identifying the main features of the
restructuring; and (b) raising a valid expectation to those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement
the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.

**7.1.20. Income taxes**

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the
reporting period in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. In line with paragraph 46
of IAS 12 Income taxes, management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts
expected to be paid to the tax authorities. This evaluation is made for tax periods open for audit by the competent authorities.


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements.

However, the deferred tax is not recognized for:

 the initial recognition of goodwill; and

 the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction

affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for taxable temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for tax losses and tax attributes to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred taxes are calculated at the level of each fiscal entity in the Group. The Group is able to offset deferred tax assets and
liabilities only if the deferred tax balances relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

**7.1.21. Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are classified as at amortized cost, except for derivative
instruments (see 7.1.22 below).

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting
period.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including
all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums
or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount
on initial recognition.

When a financial liability measured at amortized cost is modified without this resulting in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash
flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

A limited part of trade payable is subject to reverse factoring. As the main risk and rewards of the trade payable remain with the
Group, the financial liability is not de-recognized from trade payables.

**7.1.22. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate
and commodity price risks and equity price risks associated with share-based payments, including foreign exchange forward
contracts, commodity hedging contracts and interest rate CAP’s and SWAP’s and a total return swap.

Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument,
in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

The fair values of various derivative instruments are disclosed in note 7.5 ‘Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management’.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is
more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

If no hedge accounting is applied, the Group recognizes all gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives in
the consolidated income statement within Other operating income/expense to the extent that they relate to operating activities
and within Net finance cost to the extent that they relate to the financing activities of the Group (e.g. interest rate swaps relating
to the floating rate borrowings).

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.


-----

**7.1.23. Hedge accounting**

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk and commodities,
as cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized
in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss and is included in the ‘other operating income/(expense)' line item.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the
periods when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated income statement as the
recognized hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction
is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated
in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.24. Operating segments**

The Group’s activities are in one segment. There are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate.
The chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors, reviews the operating results (defined as EBITDA) and operating
plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis; therefore, the Group operates as one segment.

**7.1.25. Statement of cash flows**

The cash flows of the Group are presented using the indirect method. This method reconciles the movement in cash for the
reporting period by adjusting net profit of the year for any non-cash items and changes in working capital, and identifying investing
and financing cash flows for the reporting period.

###### 7.2. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Alternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in the financial communication of the Group since management believes
that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of
performance and liquidity. The alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results, our performance or our liquidity under IFRS.

**7.2.1. Non-recurring income and expenses**

Income and expenses classified under the heading “non-recurring income and expenses” are those items that are considered by
management not to relate to transactions, projects and adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities taking place in the ordinary
course of activities of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses are presented separately, due to their size or nature, so
as to allow users of the consolidated financial statements of the Company to get a better understanding of the normalized
performance of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses relate to:

 acquisition-related expenses;

 changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context of business combinations;

 changes to the Group structure, business restructuring costs, including costs related to the liquidation of subsidiaries and the

closure, opening or relocations of factories;

 impairment of assets and major litigations.

Non-recurring income and expenses of the Group for the years ended December 31 are composed of the following items
presented in the consolidated income statement and can be reconciled in note 7.24:

 income/(expenses) related to changes to Group structure; and

 income/(expenses) related to impairments and major litigations.

**7.2.2. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance cost, income taxes, depreciations and amortizations. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**Full Year**

**in € million** **2020** **2019**

**Operating profit** **110.9** **87.2**
Depreciation and amortization 86.8 87.6

**EBITDA** **197.7** **174.8**

Non-recurring income and expenses 37.9 70.3
**Adjusted EBITDA** **235.6** **245.1**

**7.2.3. Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio (Leverage)**

Net financial debt is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and deducting cash and cash equivalents.

LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses for the last twelve months (LTM).

Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of the Group for the years ended December 31 are presented in note 7.3 ‘Capital
Management’.


-----

**7.2.4. Free Cash Flow**

Free cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operating activities (as presented in the consolidated cash flow statement,
i.e. including income taxes paid) less capital expenditures (Capex, defined as purchases of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets), less repayment of lease liabilities and including cash (used in)/from disposal.

Free Cash Flow of the Group for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

**Full Year**

**in € million** **2020** **2019**

**Operating profit** **110.9** **87.2**
Depreciation and amortization 86.8 87.6

**Free cash flow** **59.5** **109.7**

**7.2.5. Adjusted Basic Earnings and Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share**

Adjusted Basic Earnings (or Adjusted Profit) are defined as profit for the period plus non-recurring income and expenses and tax
effect on non-recurring income and expenses, attributable to the owners of the parent. Adjusted Basic Earnings per share are
defined as Adjusted Basic Earnings divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share for the years ended December 31 are presented in note 7.16 ‘Earnings per share’.

**7.2.6. Working Capital**

The components of our working capital are inventories, trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other receivables plus trade
payables and accrued expenses and other payables.

**7.2.7. Alternative Performance Measures included in the Press releases and other Regulated**

**information**

**Pro-forma revenue at constant currency**

Pro-forma revenue at constant currency is defined as revenue for the 12 months period ending on the reporting date at prior year
foreign exchange rates and inclusive of impact of mergers and acquisitions.

**Like-for-Like (LFL) revenue**

Like-for-like revenue is defined as revenue at constant currency excluding change in scope of consolidation or M&A.

###### 7.3. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide benefits for shareholders.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt position. The Group’s net debt position is calculated by adding all short
and long-term interest-bearing debts and by deducting the available short-term liquidity.

The net debt positions of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Non-current interest-bearing debts 911.4 919.5

Current interest-bearing debts 366.3 69.6

Cash and cash equivalents (430.1) (127.8)

**Total net debt position** **847.6** **861.3**

LTM Adjusted EBITDA 235.6 245.1

**Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio** **3.60** **3.51**

The Group is subject to covenants, which are further disclosed in note 7.17.

###### 7.4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements involve the use of estimates and assumptions about the future.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual amounts may differ from
these estimates. The estimates and assumptions that could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are discussed
below.

**7.4.1. COVID-19**

As disclosed in the Integrated Annual Report, infectious diseases of epidemic and pandemic potential are considered a significant
risk to economic activity and consequently one faced by the Group. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which has been
visible since early 2020 until today is a clear example of such risk.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken to contain the virus and minimize its consequences (government
lockdowns in most countries), have had and are expected to continue to have adverse effects on the activities and financial results
of the Group, including market demand, operating profitability (EBITDA), financial position and cash flows.

Our entire organization is concentrating its efforts on ensuring safe working conditions and ensuring supply of essential hygiene
products to our customers in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The health and safety of all Ontex colleagues is our paramount priority. Since the spread of the COVID-19 virus to countries where
we have operations, we have followed all the guidelines provided by the relevant authorities. Where remote working is not possible,
we are taking additional steps beyond the guidelines to provide a safe working environment for employees.

We are committed to serving consumers and customers who rely on an uninterrupted supply of critical, daily-use personal hygiene
products. All our production and supply chain operations are functioning thanks to our constantly-updated business continuity
plans, which include working tirelessly with governments, customers and suppliers whose support has been critical.

We continue to provide support to the many communities where we live and work through donations of our products and indemand safety equipment such as safety gloves from third parties to hospitals, nursing homes and social support organization.

The Group has a solid financial position and liquidity. As a matter of caution due to the current level of economic uncertainty, we
decided to fully draw down the € 300 million of the syndicated revolving credit facility (maturing in November 2022) to provide
financial flexibility if necessary.

The Group complied with all requirements of the loan covenants on its available credit facilities throughout the reporting period.

As described above, our business, financial condition, cash flows and operating results have been and may continue to be
negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Group’s solid finance and liquidity structure should however be more than
sufficient to ensure the going concern of the Company.

**7.4.2. Income taxes**

The Group has tax losses and other tax incentives usable to offset future taxable profits, mainly in Belgium, Brazil, France and
Spain, amounting to € 557.3 million at December 31, 2020 (€ 583.0 million at December 31, 2019).

The European Commission challenged Belgium’s excess profit ruling (EPR) system, characterizing this system as illegal state
aid. Ontex, through its Belgian subsidiary Ontex BV, had an EPR covering the years 2011-2015. Ontex has lodged an appeal
against this EC decision. The General Court has handed down its judgment on February 14, 2019 in the joint case of Belgium vs
Commission and Magnetrol International vs Commission. The General Court has annulled the Commission’s Decision for the


-----

reason that the Commission erroneously considered that the excess profit exemption system constituted an aid scheme. The
European Commission has appealed the decision of the General Court to the European Court of Justice and we await the
outcome.

Furthermore, the European Commission opened individual investigations in September 2019 into each of the individual EPRs
including that of Ontex, as it believes that each EPR grants illegal state aid, even if the EPR system does not. The formal
investigation into the Ontex EPR continues and it is unclear when a final decision can be expected. Ontex will have the right to
appeal against any decision that concludes the Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid. Any such appeal will take some time to be
heard.

Ontex had fully taken into account the impact of the Commission’s appeal that the EPR system is illegal state aid being successful,
and the Commission concluding that the Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid in its tax position. Since the outcome of both challenges
is not yet final, Ontex will not release the relevant provisions at this stage.

The Group has only recognized deferred tax assets on € 124.1 million of tax losses and other tax incentives out of the € 557.3
million mentioned above. The measurement of these deferred tax assets depends on a number of judgmental assumptions
regarding the future probable taxable profits of different Group subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. These estimates are made
prudently to the extent of the best current knowledge.

The Group applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. Since the Group operates in a
complex multinational environment, it assesses whether certain uncertain tax provisions should be recognized in its consolidated
financial statements (based on the requirements of IFRIC 23).

**7.4.3. Business combinations**

For business combinations, the Group must make assumptions and estimates to determine the purchase price allocation of the
business being acquired. To do so, the Group must determine the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and estimates have an impact on the asset and liability amounts recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on the acquisition date. In addition, the estimated useful lives of the acquired
property, plant and equipment, the identification of other intangible assets and the determination of the indefinite or finite useful
lives of other intangible assets acquired requires significant judgments and will have an impact on the Group’s profit or loss.

**7.4.4. Impairment**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note
7.1.4 “Goodwill”. The outcome of these goodwill impairment tests in 2020 did not result in an impairment loss (2019: nil).

The Group identifies the following cash-generating units:

 Europe

 Healthcare

 MEAA (Middle East, Africa and Asia)

 Americas

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, demand and competition in the
markets where we operate, product offerings, product mix and pricing, raw materials availability and cost, direct and indirect
expenses, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditure and working capital, etc. as reflected in Ontex’ financial budgets
and strategic plans, as well as discount rates. For more details on the impairment test performed, we refer to note 7.9 ‘Goodwill
and intangible assets’. The discount rates used are summarized here below:

**Full Year**
**in %** **2020** **2019**

**Pre-tax discount rate**
Europe 5.7% 6.1%
Healthcare 5.3% 6.4%
Middle East, Africa and Asia 11.2% 9.1%
Americas 7.4% 6.8%

A sensitivity analysis indicates that the recoverable amount of Europe, Healthcare, Middle East Africa and Asia (MEAA) and
Americas would be equal to their carrying amount if the pre-tax discount rates of the CGUs were 7.9%, 23.3%, 19.0% and 8.7%,
respectively and all other variables kept constant.

As indicated in note 7.9, cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.0% for
Europe, 1.5% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MEAA and 3.6% for Americas. These same percentages are used as perpetual growth
rates. The growth rates have been determined by management but do not exceed the current market expectations in which the
four CGUs are currently operating. Should the growth rate for any of the CGUs decrease by 40%, no impairment would need to
be recognized.

Should the estimated operating margins decrease by 20%, no impairment would be recognized.


-----

Future cash flows are estimates that are likely to be revised in future periods as underlying assumptions change. Key assumptions
in supporting the value of goodwill include long-term interest rates and other market data. Should the assumptions vary adversely
in the future, the value in use of goodwill may reduce below their carrying amounts. Based on current valuations, headroom
appears to be sufficient to absorb a normal variation in the underlying assumptions.

**7.4.5. Expected useful lives**

The expected useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets must be estimated. The determination of the
useful lives of the assets is based on management’s judgment and it is reviewed at least at each financial year-end, pursuant to
IAS 16 and IAS 38.

**7.4.6. Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments**

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions
that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. All derivative financial instruments are, in
accordance with IFRS 7, level 2. This means valuation methods are used for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the
recorded fair value are observable in the market, either directly or indirectly.

**7.4.7. Employee benefits**

The carrying amount of the Group’s employee benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions.
One particularly sensitive assumption used for determining the net cost of the benefits granted is the discount rate. Any change
to this assumption will affect the carrying amount of those obligations.

The discount rate depends on the duration of the benefit, i.e. the average duration of the engagements, weighted with the present
value of the costs linked to those engagements. According to IAS 19, the discount rate should correspond to the rate of highquality corporate bonds of similar term to the benefits valued and in the same currency.

**7.4.8. Revenue recognition**

For the accrual for volume discounts (to customers and from suppliers) important judgements are made on the impact of
commercial decisions that will influence the final discount to be received or to be granted.

In the context of the Group’s financial risk management, the Group uses derivative instruments to cover specific risks, such as
foreign currency exposure, interest rate exposure and commodity price exposure. The following table presents an overview of the
derivative instruments outstanding at reporting date:


-----

**Fair value** **Nominal amounts**
**December 31,** **December 31,** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**in € million** **2020** **2019** **2020** **2019**

**Derivative financial assets** **18.7** **1.4** **134.2** **67.3**
_Cross-Currency Interest rate swap_ _15.0_ _1.3_ _47.0_ _47.0_
_Forward foreign exchange contracts_ _1.0_ _0.1_ _60.3_ _20.3_
_Commodity hedging contracts_ _2.7_ _-_ _26.9_ _-_
**Derivative financial liabilities** **14.0** **11.9** **734.7** **625.5**
_Interest rate swap_ _7.1_ _8.9_ _510.0_ _510.0_
_Forward foreign exchange contracts_ _6.9_ _2.5_ _224.7_ _106.9_
_Commodity hedging contracts_ _0.5_ _8.5_

The derivative instruments presented in the tables above are all designated in a cash flow hedge relationship (see below in notes
7.5.3 to 7.5.5).

The fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is exceeding
12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

The fair value of the derivatives is based on level 2 inputs as defined under IFRS 7.27, meaning inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The above table provides an analysis of financial instruments grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair
value (recognized on the statement of financial position or disclosed in the notes) is observable:

 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or

liabilities.

 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are

observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that

are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on mathematical models that use market observable data and
are determined as follows:

 The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid

markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed redeemable notes).

 The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted

cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives,
and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward
exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps
are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived
from quoted interest rates.

 The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding those described above) are determined in

accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.

 Level 3 liabilities: the amount has been determined based on contractual agreements.

The Group has derivative financial instruments which are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and
similar agreements. No offsetting needed to be done per December 31, 2020 (nor 2019).

The counterparties of the outstanding derivative instruments have an A-credit rating.

**7.5.2. Financial risk factors**

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity
price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the risk management department since last year-end or in any risk management policies.

**7.5.3. Foreign exchange risk**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily
with respect to the British pound (GBP), the Turkish lira (TRY), the Polish zloty (PLN), the Australian dollar (AUD), the Mexican
peso (MXN), the Brazilian real (BRL) and Russian ruble (RUB) in relation to sales, and the US dollar (USD), the Czech koruna
(CZK), the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Brazilian real (BRL) in relation to procurement. Foreign exchange risk arises from future
commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Group also has exposures to the Turkish lira (TRY), Algerian
dinar (DZD), Russian ruble (RUB), Czech koruna (CZK), Australian dollar (AUD) Pakistani rupee (PKR), Mexican peso (MXN)
and Brazilian real (BRL) due to their net investments in foreign operations.


-----

The carrying amounts of the Group's main foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of
the reporting period are as follows:

**Assets** **Liabilities**

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**

EUR 2,630.6 1,895.8 4,156.8 2,589.2
BRL 44.7 53.1 87.5 90.7
USD 129.0 95.6 160.7 160.0
MXN 45.5 56.3 48.8 36.7
PLN 101.6 107.8 54.0 61.7
DZD 31.4 34.7 0.0 8.0
RUB 23.2 26.9 2.3 1.2

GBP 85.4 66.9 52.5 44.5

TRY 15.7 18.7 7.5 6.5

AUD 26.3 29.6 14.0 17.1

The Group monitors its foreign exchange exposure closely and will enter into hedging transactions if deemed appropriate to
minimize exposure throughout the Group to foreign exchange fluctuations. All hedging decisions are subject to approval of the
Board of Directors. The strategy regarding FX hedges was maintained.

To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, the Group
uses forward exchange contracts. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions, recognized assets and
liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Group treasury is responsible for optimizing
the net position in each foreign currency when possible and appropriate. The Group applies hedge accounting for the hedge
related transactions, the impact of the revaluation is recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Group has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in 2020 maturing at the latest in April 2022 in order to limit volatility
in the business resulting from exposures to sales in British pound, Polish zloty, Australian dollar as well as purchases in US dollar
and Czech crown during 2021. Based on the hedge strategy, the foreign exchange forward contracts hedge the following
forecasted exposures until December 31, 2021: for British pound (GBP) 60.4 million, for Polish zloty (PLN) 299.7 million, for
Australian dollar (AUD) 23.9 million, for Czech crown (CZK) 645.7 million, for US dollar (USD) 66.8 million versus EUR, US dollar
(USD) 12.5 million versus Mexican peso (MXN), US dollar (USD) 18.7 million versus Brazilian real (BRL), US dollar (USD) 13.1
million versus Czech crown (CZK), for Brazilian real (BRL) 6.4 million and for Mexican peso (MXN) 3.8 million.

The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the highly probable forecast
transactions. The Group applies hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts. At inception, these instruments were
designated as cash flow hedges. At the moment the forecast transactions materialize, the foreign exchange forward contracts
become fair value hedges. As the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable
forecast transactions, there is no hedge ineffectiveness to be recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, an unrealized loss of € 2.2 million (Australian dollar, Polish zloty, US dollar) has been
recognized in other comprehensive income.

As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the derivative financial asset for the foreign exchange contracts amounted to € 1.0
million (2019: € 0.1 million) and of the derivative financial liability amounted to € 6.9 million (2019: € 2.5 million).

The following table sets forth the impact on pre-tax profit and equity for the year of a 10% weakening/strengthening of the Euro
against the reported currency with all other variables held constant. The impact is mainly as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of foreign currency denominated trade receivables and payables and related derivative positions as at

**7.5.4. Interest rate risk**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash
flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rate expose the Group to
fair value interest rate risk. These risks are managed centrally by Group treasury taking into account the expectations of the Group
with respect to the evolutions of the market rates. The Group has used interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps
to manage these risks.

Considering that the floating rate borrowings (EURIBOR + margin) are hedged through interest rate swaps, the interest expense
recognized in the consolidated income statement is not subject to interest rate volatility and therefore no sensitivity analysis has
been prepared.

_Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to loans: at December 31, 2020, if EURIBOR interest rates_
had been 10bps higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have
been negligible. At December 31, 2019, if EURIBOR interest rates had been 10bps higher/lower with all other variables held
constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively € 0.2 million lower / € 0.3 million higher.

Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.50%.
Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan B due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.30%. Floating Rate
Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.40%. The notional principal
amounts of the outstanding fixed payer interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2020
are € 557.0 million as per below table:

**Duration** **Fixed interest rate %** **Amount in € million**
2 Year 0.3890% 85.0
2 Year 0.4950% 50.0
2 Year 0.6250% 75.0
2 Year 0.6290% 75.0
2 Year 0.6220% 75.0
2 Year 2.4100% 33.1
2 Year 2.4700% 4.5
2 Year 2.5950% 9.4
4 Year 0.5950% 150.0

**Total** **557.0**

**7.5.5. Price risk (commodity)**
The Group has some exposure to the price of oil because certain of the raw materials used in production are manufactured from
oil derivatives. These include glues, polyethylene, propylene and polypropylene.

In relation to our fluff exposure, the Group has arrangements with certain of their fluff suppliers that reduce our exposure to
volatility in fluff prices. The Group also decided to hedge a portion of the propylene, polypropylene and polyethylene exposure
that is not covered by such arrangements for 2020.

Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to commodities: at December 31, 2020 if there would be a
shift of the commodity forward curve by 10% increase/decrease with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other
comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively € 2.5 million higher / € 2.5 million lower (2019: impact was €
1.1 million higher / € 0.5 million lower).

**7.5.6. Equity price risk**

Following the issuance of options and RSU’s as share-based payment arrangements under the different LTIP programs (refer to
note 7.28 for details of these programs), the Group is exposed to variations in the Group share price. The Board of Directors of
the Group has decided on June 1, 2015 to implement a full hedging program through a total return swap. The purpose of this
financial instrument is to effectively hedge the risk that a price increase of the Ontex shares would negatively impact future cash
flows related to the share-based payments.

The Group entered into a total return swap (‘TRS’) agreement with a financial institution to manage its exposure to price volatility
related to the shares subject to the stock option, RSU and PSU plans as disclosed in note 7.28. Under the total return swap
agreement, the Company will pay interest to the financial institution. At the settlement of the TRS, the Group will receive the
underlying shares which will be granted to the beneficiaries of the stock options, RSU’s or PSU’s upon exercise. As such, the
Group hedges the risk that the share price would increase when shares have to be issued upon exercise by the beneficiaries of
their Options/RSU’s/PSU’s. The shares bought in this context are recognized in deduction of Group equity at the strike price at
the moment of entering into the TRS. As the Group takes physical delivery of the shares upon settlement of the TRS (no net
settlement), the TRS does not meet the scope of financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 / IFRS 9. As such, the TRS
should not be remeasured at fair value at each closing date.

As a result, the Group recognized treasury shares for an amount of € 38.8 million (represented by 1,445,113 shares) and a related
financial liability for an amount of € 31.2 million (see note 7.15). These amounts do not require to be remeasured during the
contract time and consequently, all volatility has been eliminated.


-----

**7.5.7. Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to corporate customers, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions. The Group assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial
position, past experience and other factors based on which individual risk limits are set in accordance with the limits set by
business managers. Historical default rates have been below 1% for 2020 and 2019. Trade receivables are spread over different
countries and counterparties and there is no large concentration with one or a few counterparties.

We refer to note 7.13 for the aging of the receivables and the doubtful receivables.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount as presented in the table above in the note
7.5.1.

**7.5.8. Liquidity risk**

Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 7.17 Interest-bearing debts) at
all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on its borrowing facilities.

The table below analyzes the Group’s financial liabilities (including interest payments) into relevant maturity groupings based on
the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

**Less than** **Between 1** **Between 2**

###### 7.6. OPERATING SEGMENTS

According to IFRS 8, reportable operating segments are identified based on the “management approach”. This approach stipulates
external segment reporting based on the Group’s internal organizational and management structure and on internal financial
reporting to the chief operating decision maker. The Group’s activities are in one segment, “Hygienic Disposable Products”. There
are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate. The chief operating decision maker, the Board of
Directors, reviews the operating results and operating plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis.
Therefore, the Group operates as one segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about product sales, geographic areas and revenue
from major customers are presented below:

**7.6.1.** **Information by Division**

The Company’s commercial activities are now organized in three Divisions in order to seize opportunities arising from our
geographic expansion with the establishment of new growth platforms in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, improve execution
and bolster focus on our competitive differentiators:

 Europe, which is predominantly focused on retail brands

 Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia (AMEAA), which is predominantly focused on local brands

 Healthcare, which continues to focus on the institutional markets and dedicated incontinence brands


**Full Year**


**in € million** **2020** **2019**

Europe 872.2 956.9

AMEAA 774.1 882.9

Healthcare 440.5 441.6

**Total revenue** **2,086.8** **2,281.3**

2019 revenue in AMEAA and Healthcare has been adjusted due to a shift of customer responsibility between these Divisions
effective January 1, 2020, which has no impact on total Ontex revenue.

**7.6.2. Information by product group**

The key product categories are:

 Babycare products, principally baby diapers, baby pants and, to a lesser extent, wet wipes;

 Feminine care products, such as sanitary towels, panty liners and tampons;

 Adult incontinence products, such as adult pants, adult diapers, incontinence towels and bed protection.


**Full Year**


**in € million** **2020** **2019**

Babycare 1,162.5 1,345.7

Adult Incontinence 679.5 692.0

Other 32.6 30.9

**Total revenue** **2,086.8** **2,281.3**


-----

**7.6.3. Information by geographic area**

The organizational structure of the Group and its system of internal information indicates that the main source of geographical
risks results from the location of its customers (destination of its sales) and not the physical location of its assets (origin of its
sales). The location of Group’s customers is accordingly the geographical segmentation criterion and is defined as below:

 Western Europe

 Eastern Europe

 Americas

 Rest of the World


**Full Year**


**in € million** **2020** **2019**

Western Europe 983.0 1,027.5

**Total revenue** **2,086.8** **2,281.3**

The sales in the country of domicile of Ontex Group NV (Belgium) represent less than 3% of Ontex Group NV Revenue. Sales to
countries in our top four markets are presented in the table below. The sales in all other individual countries represent less than
10% of the Group’s revenue.


**Full Year**

The following table presents an overview of the non-current assets (property, plant and equipment (PP&E), right to use assets
and intangible assets) located in the main countries. The non-current assets in all other individual countries represent less than
10% of the Group’s total non-current assets (excluding financial instruments, deferred tax assets and goodwill). Goodwill is not
included in the below table as this not monitored on a country-basis, but at the divisional level.

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**

###### 7.8. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

**7.8.1. Acquisitions**

On July 1, 2020, Ontex completed the acquisition of the feminine hygiene business of Albaad in Rockingham County, consisting
of the production lines and related equipment as well as a license for all corresponding inventory and intellectual property. The
production lines produce feminine hygiene pads. Ontex will benefit from an experienced team of new colleagues who join the
Ontex Group and operate the acquired equipment. This acquisition strengthens Ontex’ growing feminine hygiene business in
North America, providing more robust supply capabilities and options for current and prospective customers.

Upon closing, the Group has paid a consideration of USD 8.4 million (i.e. € 7.5 million) in cash.

The net assets acquired amount to € 7.5 million. As a consequence, the Group recognized no goodwill in the statement of financial
position. The purchase price allocation is still on-going and hence the determination of the goodwill is provisional and will be
completed within 12 months from the acquisition date.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date:

**Goodwill**

_History_

At the end of 2010, Ontex was acquired from Candover by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and TPG Capital, both holding 50%
of the shares of the new Ontex top-holding company. At the time of the acquisition, the net assets of Ontex were negative which
resulted in the generation of goodwill of € 841.5 million.

In 2013, Ontex acquired Serenity, a company operating in the adult incontinence market in Italy. This acquisition resulted tin the
recognition of a goodwill of € 18.6 million.

In February 2016, Ontex acquired Grupo Mabe, a leading Mexican manufacturer of disposable personal hygiene products. This
major acquisition resulted in the recognition of a goodwill for € 236.1 million, which was denominated in Mexican peso and US
dollars.

In March 2017, Ontex has completed the acquisition of the personal hygiene business of Hypermarcas (renamed to “Ontex
Brazil”). This resulted in a goodwill of € 128.3 million, which was denominated in Brazilian real.

_Goodwill impairment_

The Group identifies the following cash-generating units:

 Europe

 Healthcare

 MEAA (Middle East, Africa and Asia)

 Americas

Annual impairment reviews are performed during the fourth quarter of each year for all CGUs. These reviews compare the carrying
value of each CGU with the recoverable amount of the CGU’s assets calculated using a discounted cash flow model. If the
recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the income
statement.

The judgments and estimates considered in the context of the impairment tests are disclosed in note 7.4.4.

Goodwill allocated to the CGUs as at December 31 was as follows:

**in € million** **2020** **2019**
Europe 757.7 757.7
Healthcare 60.4 60.4
MEAA 27.9 38.1
Americas 260.7 315.0
**Goodwill allocated to the CGU's** **1,106.7** **1,171.2**

The change in carrying amount of the goodwill is entirely due to exchange differences.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by means of value-in-use calculations. These calculations are based on pre-tax
cash flow projections (prepared in euros) using key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by Ontex’ Board
of Directors and the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2023. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an
estimated growth rate of 1.0% for Europe, 1.5% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MEAA and 3.6% for Americas. The growth rate does not
exceed the current market expectations in which the four CGUs are currently operating.

The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations used to determine the recoverable amount are those regarding the discount
rates, estimated changes to selling prices, product offerings, direct costs, operating margins and terminal growth rates.

The discount rate is a measure based on industry average weighted cost of capital and risk-free rates weighted for the different
regions in which the CGU’s are operating.

Changes in selling practices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The
calculation uses cash flow projections based on key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by the Board of
Directors, the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2023, and pre-tax discount rates for each CGU as described in note 7.4.4 Impairment
based on current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Group.


-----

The development of the financial budget and Strategic Plan relies on a number of assumptions, including:

 The market growth, the evolution of the Group’s market share, competitive landscape and innovation trends in the different

markets as well as strategic initiatives.

 The product mix.

 The expected evolution of various direct and indirect expenses.

 The estimated future capital expenditure.

The assumptions were derived mainly from:

 Available historic data.

 External market research.

 Internal market expectations based on trend reports, etc.

The key assumptions used are reviewed and updated on a yearly basis by the Group’s management. Taking into account the
excess of the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount over its carrying amount, and based on sensitivity testing performed,
management is of the opinion that any reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is
based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount at December 31, 2020.

The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis by reducing the risk-adjusted cash flow projections and by increasing the pre-tax
discount rate as disclosed in note 7.4.4 Impairment.

-----

The consolidated income statement presents the following amounts relating to leases:

**in € million** **2020** **2019**
Cost of Sales 8.5 10.1

Distribution expenses 10.3 11.6

Sales and marketing expenses 2.6 2.3

General administrative expenses 4.7 4.7
**Total depreciation expense** **26.1** **28.6**
Interest expense 5.8 6.9
Expense relating to short-term leases 12.0 10.5
Expense relating to leases of low-value assets 1.5 3.2
Expense relating to variable lease payments 3.0 4.3

The Group leases mainly plants and warehouses (lease terms between 3 and 25 years), machinery (lease terms of 5 years on
average) and company cars (lease terms between 4 and 5 years).

For the lease of land and buildings, the Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an
index, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index
or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used
to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group’s operations. As at December 31, 2020,
potential future cash outflows of € 21.4 million (undiscounted) have not been included in the lease liability because it is not
reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated) (2019: € 21.4 million).

The lease liabilities are detailed in note 7.17.

###### 7.12. INVENTORIES

Inventories can be split as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**

Other 5.6 5.1
Write-down on inventories (16.9) (16.6)

**Inventories** **319.1** **318.8**

The Group mainly uses fluff, super-absorbers and non-woven fabrics. Other raw materials used by the Group for its production
include polyethylene, adhesives and tapes as basic raw materials. The finished products are baby diapers, baby pants, towels,
tampons, panty liners, incontinence products and trade goods.

The cost of inventories recognized as an expense and included under ‘Cost of sales’ amounted to € 1,477.7 million in 2020 (€
1,661.3 million in 2019).


-----

###### 7.13. TRADE RECEIVABLES, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

The non-current other receivables include mainly non-current recoverable VAT.

The current trade and other receivables are detailed below:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Trade receivables 294.5 331.5
Less: allowance for impairment of trade receivables (8.2) (7.3)

Other amounts receivable 50.8 41.4

**Prepaid expenses and other receivables** **57.0** **49.1**
**Trade and other receivables - Current** **343.4** **373.3**

Other amounts receivable include recoverable VAT for an amount of € 45.4 million for 2020 (2019: € 34.3 million). The fair value
of the current receivables approximates their carrying amounts.

The aging of the trade receivables (net) at December 31 is as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Not due 246.3 284.7
0 to 30 days 22.0 20.5
31 to 60 days 6.1 5.7
61 to 90 days 3.8 4.0
Over 90 days 8.1 9.3

**Total** **286.3** **324.2**

The Group doesn’t apply systematically external credit rating. An impairment analysis of trade receivables is done based on
expected losses, next to individual assessments, but there are no significant impairments.

The carrying amount of the Group’s trade receivables (net) are denominated in the following currencies:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
EUR 80.2 92.9
BRL 31.1 42.1
PLN 38.7 42.7
MXN 30.6 44.0
USD 28.4 21.0
RUB 10.2 13.1
TRY 12.6 10.6
GBP 21.8 19.7
AUD 8.3 8.2
Other 24.4 29.9

**Total** **286.3** **324.2**

During the year, the payment terms for the receivables have neither deteriorated nor been renegotiated. The maximum credit risk
exposure at the end of the reporting period is the carrying value of each caption of receivables mentioned above. The Group does
not hold any collateral as security.

Movements on the Group allowance for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
**Opening Balance** **7.3** **6.8**
Allowance for receivable impairment 3.7 1.4
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible (1.0) (0.9)
Unused amounts reversed (0.9) (0.1)
Foreign exchange differences (0.9) 0.1
**At December 31** **8.2** **7.3**


-----

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract
assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The creation and the release of the allowance for impaired receivables have been included in ‘Sales and marketing expense’ in
the income statement.

The Group has entered into a Group non-recourse syndicate factoring agreement with BNP Paribas Fortis Factor and KBC
Commercial Finance. The Agreement provides us with a maximum credit facility of up to € 200 million and up to 95% of the amount
of the approved outstanding receivables on all debtors that we transfer to the Factor. The remaining 5% of the relevant receivables
is paid by the Factor to us upon receipt of payment from the relevant debtor, upon which also the remaining balance of the
receivable is derecognized. Financing per debtor is capped at 10% of the aggregate amount of all approved outstanding
receivables transferred to the Factor. Any financing within the credit limit is non-recourse to us. This factoring agreement is an offbalance sheet arrangement.

Next to the above-mentioned Group factoring agreement, Serenity (Italian subsidiary) entered into a bilateral factoring agreements
with Ifitalia and Banca Sistema. Furthermore, also Ontex Russia has entered into a bilateral factoring agreement with Rosbank,
Ontex Brazil has entered into a bilateral factoring agreements with Banco Safra and Banco Industrial and Ontex Mexico has
entered into a bilateral factoring agreement with HSBC. All these agreements are non-recourse agreements.

As at December 31, 2020, € 143.2 million of financing was obtained through the factoring programs (€ 149.1 million in 2019), this
is in addition to € 12.8 million of financing was obtained through the use of supply chain financing programs offered by our
customers. The late payment risk related to the factoring has been assessed as immaterial at closing 2020 and 2019.

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments, all non-recourse trade receivables, included in these factoring programs, are
derecognized for the non-continuing involvement part.

###### 7.14. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The net cash position as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows:

###### 7.16. EARNINGS PER SHARE

In accordance with IAS 33, the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to
ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The number
of shares used for 2020 was 80,851,227, which is the weighted average number of shares for 2020 (2019: 80,804,164 shares).

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent
(after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.


-----

In case of Ontex Group NV, no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders. The table below reflects
the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

**Full Year**

**in € million** **2020** **2019**

**Basic earnings**

Adjusted basic earnings per share 1.01 1.07
Adjusted diluted earnings per share 1.01 1.07

A weighted average number of 1,280,472 options were not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share as they
were out-of-the-money at year-end 2020 (2019: 831,989 options).

All borrowings are denominated in € as of December 31, 2020, except for local borrowings in Mexico in MXN (€ 8.7 million
equivalent), Pakistan in PKR (€ 5.7 million equivalent) and export financing in Brazil in BRL (€ 2.6 million equivalent) (2019: all in
€, except for borrowings in Mexico in MXN (€ 15.3 million equivalent).

On September 26, 2017, the Group entered into a syndicate credit facilities agreement (Syndicated Term Loan A) in an amount
of € 600.0 million, and a revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Facility B) in an amount of up to € 300.0 million. The Syndicated
Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.50%. The Senior Revolving
Facility B due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.30%, which was fully used at closing 2020.

Furthermore, the Group has also closed a Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months
+ margin of 1.40%. This agreement also includes an accordion option of € 100 million, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR
3 months + margin of 1.40%.

As a matter of caution due to the current level of economic uncertainty, the Senior Revolving Facility (maturing in September
2022) of € 300 million has been drawn down to provide financial flexibility if necessary (2019: undrawn).

On July 29, 2015, a full hedging program (total return swap) for the share-based payment arrangements (LTIP) was implemented.
For more information we refer to note 7.5.6 and 7.28. This program was renewed in 2020. Total return swap remained stable at
an amount of € 31.2 million (2019: € 31.2 million).

###### 7.18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES 

The Group grants its working and retired personnel post-employment benefits, long-term benefits, and termination benefits. These
benefits have been valued in conformity with IAS 19. The related IAS 19 liability recognized in the statement of financial position
can be analyzed as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Post-employment benefits 23.9 24.2
Long-term benefits 2.8 2.7

**Employee benefit liabilities** **26.6** **26.9**
Short-term employee benefit liabilities 52.5 55.1
**Net liability** **79.1** **82.0**

The calculation of the liability is based on actuarial assumptions that have been determined on the various balance sheet dates.
They are based not only on macro-economic factors valid for the dates in question but also on the specific characteristics of the
various schemes evaluated. They represent the Group’s best estimate for the future. They are periodically reviewed in accordance
with the evolution of the markets and available statistics.

**Post-employment benefits**

Ontex makes payments on a defined contribution basis to both state and private pension arrangements across our operations. In
addition, Ontex operates a defined benefit insurance scheme in Belgium and Ontex also has an obligation to make severance
payments to employees upon their retirement in France and Turkey.

Ontex also operates several unfunded pension arrangements in respect of our German operations. The German operations do
not fund the pension arrangements but reflect pension scheme liabilities in company accounts on an IAS 19 basis. The pension
benefits are paid by the relevant company as they fall due.

The Group operates a couple of defined contribution (DC) plans which receive fixed contributions. The Group’s legal or
constructive obligation for these plans is limited to the contributions. The expense recognized in the current period in relation to
these contributions amounts to € 4.9 million (see also note 7.22 below; 2019: € 4.0 million).

In Belgium, the defined contribution (DC) plans are subject to a minimum guaranteed rate of return by law and are hence treated
as defined benefit (DB) plans. In practice, this guarantee is mainly covered by insurance companies. As there is no deficit as per
December 31, 2020, no liability has been recognized (2019: nil). The accumulated reserves of these plans are equal to the assets.
There are no risks to which the plan exposes the entity, focusing on any unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and of any
significant concentrations of risk.

###### 7.19. DEFERRED TAXES AND CURRENT TAXES

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and when the deferred taxes relate
to the same fiscal authority. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

**December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
**Deferred tax** **Deferred tax** **Deferred tax** **Deferred tax**

**in € million** **asset** **liability** **asset** **liability**

**Deferred tax assets & liabilities - Net** **24.9** **(29.2)** **29.3** **(34.7)**


Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differences, tax attributes carried forward and tax losses carried forward to the
extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.

The tax losses carried forward mainly relate to France, Belgium, Brazil, Spain and the US. In Belgium, France and US, deferred
tax assets have been recognized on tax losses carried forward considering the expected taxable profits in the foreseeable future.

The Group did not recognize deferred tax assets of € 123.8 million (2019: € 124.1 million) on the tax losses carried forward. Tax
losses can in principle be carried forward indefinitely.

The Group did not recognize deferred taxes associated with investments in subsidiaries. There is currently no policy or detailed
plan in relation to the payment of dividends within the Group.

**in € million** **December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Current tax assets 18.8 15.8
Current tax liabilities (31.8) (39.4)

The current tax assets mainly relate to the excess of pre-payments made compared to the actual income tax payable for the year.
The current tax liabilities include an amount of € 17.8 million actual corporate taxes payable (2019: € 33.3 million) and € 14.0

launched at year-end 2020. The provision mainly includes termination benefits. The additional provisions have been recognized
in ‘Non-recurring income and expenses’, under the heading ‘Restructuring’.

The Group recognizes a provision for certain legal claims filed against the Group by customers, suppliers or former employees.

On September 2, 2014, Ontex received a notification that the Spanish Competition Authorities (CNMC) opened infringement
proceedings against 15 companies in the sector (including three subsidiaries of the Company: Ontex Es Holdco, S.A., Ontex
Peninsular, S.A.U. and Ontex ID, S.A.U.) with respect to alleged conduct of fixing prices and other commercial conditions in the
Spanish market for heavy adult incontinence products. On May 26, 2016, following the investigation, the CNMC issued its decision.
In its decision it has found eight companies, including Ontex' Spanish subsidiaries guilty of being part of a cartel. For its
involvement from 1999 to 2014, Ontex was fined € 5.2 million. Ontex initiated an appeal against the decision and this appeal is
pending. As per December 31, 2016, a provision amounting to € 5.2 million has been accounted for. The provision has not been
adjusted per December 31, 2020.

 income and expenses related to changes to Group structure; and

**7.24.1. Income and expenses related to changes to Group structure**

**Restructuring**

In 2020, the cost relates to the restructuring expenses in the context of the redistribution/re-allocation of production capabilities
and the strategic review of the geographical footprint of the Group. As such, the Company decided to downsize some production
capacity which has been announced to the relevant stakeholders and resulted in the recognition of a restructuring provision at
year-end 2020 (€ 5.0 million).

The Group announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 an in-depth review of the Group’s overhead cost structure. The costs incurred
in 2020 mainly relate to the start of this review (€ 12.7 million).

On March 7, 2019, Ontex informed its employees at the Yangzhou (China) plant of its intention to cease production by mid-2019.
This plant primarily manufactures feminine care products for the Western European market, and this production will be re-allocated
to other Ontex plants. The costs recognized in 2019, € 1.5 million relates mainly to the restructuring expenses.

The expenses recognized in 2019 related to the Group reorganization and comprehensive transformation plan, Transform2Grow
(T2G), announced in May 2019 which aimed to step-change the operational efficiency and commercial practices. The costs
recognized in 2019 relate to in-depth assessments of the different processes and the start of the implementation of different
projects to increase the operational efficiency. Total expenses related to the execution of the projects amounted to € 0.5 million
in 2020 and € 54.7 million in 2019.

**Acquisition-related items**

Acquisition-related items include the expenses incurred in the context of the acquisition of the feminine hygiene business of Albaad
in Rockingham County (see note 7.8.1; 2020: € 0.5 million).

Also, in the context of a strategic review of our operations, the Group reviewed external opportunities on the market to accelerate
its progress in its operational development. The costs incurred relate to due diligence expenses (2020: € 5.0 million).

**7.24.2. Income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations**

**Impairment of assets**

The impairment loss is a non-cash item and relates in 2020 to impairment losses recognized on idle machinery.

In 2019, this relates mainly to the impairment of assets as a result of the transfer of the manufacturing operation in Aparecida de
Goiânia in Brazil to its manufacturing site in Senador Canedo.

**Litigation and claims**

The Company incurred specific legal fees in the context of certain on-going or potential litigation matters which are expected to
result in a potential benefit for the Company or in the avoidance of potential future expenses.

###### 7.28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Since September 2014 the Company implemented yearly Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIP’), which are based on a combination
of stock options (further ‘Options’) and restricted stock units (further ‘RSU’s’). In 2019 the long-term incentive plan changed in a
combination of RSU’s, Options and Performance Stock Units (further ‘PSU’s’), each representing one third of the total long-term
incentive grant value. The Options, RSU’s and PSU’s are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments. The Options,
RSU’s and PSU’s can only vest and Options giving the right to receive shares of the Company (further ‘Shares’) or any other
rights to acquire Shares can only be exercisable as from three years after the grant. The RSU’s, PSU’s and Options will vest
subject to the condition that the participant remains in service. The share price is considered to be the relevant performance
indicator and the vesting of the award will not be subject to additional specific performance conditions, except for PSU’s. For the
vesting of the PSU’s, the Board has set targets for the next 3-year performance period in terms of specific targets (both finance
and non-finance KPI’s). The Articles of Association authorize the Company to deviate from such rule, as allowed under the Belgian
Companies Code.

The exercise price of the Options will be equal to the last closing rating of the Share immediately preceding the option grant date.
For the Options, the exercise period will start on the vesting date.

The Shares underlying the RSU’s and PSU’s will be granted for free as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the RSU’s
and the PSU’s.

Upon vesting of RSU’s and PSU’s, the Shares underlying the RSU’s and PSU’s are transferred to the participants, while upon
vesting, Options may be exercised until their expiry date (eight years from the date of grant).

On or about September 26, 2014, a total of 242,642 stock options and 49,040 RSU’s were granted, 104,001 options and 49,040
RSU’s have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2020. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable

have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2020. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable between

1 The average exercise price mentioned in the table above relates only to the stock options, as the RSU's and PSU’s do not have an exercise price.

² The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2020 was € 14.22 (2019: € 16.48).

The fair value of the stock options has been determined based on the Black and Scholes model. The expected volatility used in
the model is based on the historical volatility of the Company.

Below is an overview of all the parameters used in this model:

**LTIP 2014** **LTIP 2015** **LTIP 2016** **LTIP 2017** **LTIP 2018** **LTIP 2019** **LTIP 2020**

The fair value of the RSU’s and PSU’s has been determined by deducting from the exercise price the expected and discounted
dividend flow, based on the same parameters as above.

Social charges related to the LTIP are accrued for over the vesting period.

###### 7.29. CONTINGENCIES

The Group is involved in a number of environmental, contractual, product liability, intellectual property, employment and other
claims and disputes incidental to our business.

COFECE, the Mexican antitrust authority, is conducting an investigation in our industry. To the best of the Group’s knowledge,
the facts under investigation relate to periods prior to its acquisition of Grupo PI Mabe, S.A. de C.V. (“Mabe”). Ontex and Mabe
have been proactively and fully cooperating with COFECE in the investigation and intend to continue to do so. Based on the facts
and circumstances known to it and in light of the contractual terms of the Mabe acquisition, the Group does not expect the
investigation to result in a net financial cost to it.

The Group currently believes that the disposition of the claims and disputes, individually or in aggregate, should not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

 STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF THE COMPANY ONTEX GROUP NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019   

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated accounts of Ontex Group
NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”, “Ontex”). This report includes our report on the consolidated accounts,
as well as the other legal and regulatory requirements. This report forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 24 May 2017, following the proposal formulated by the
board of directors and following the recommendation by the audit committee. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019. We have performed the statutory
audit of the consolidated accounts of Ontex Group NV for 6 consecutive years.

###### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

**Unqualified opinion**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2019, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information,
and which is characterised by a consolidated statement of financial position total of EUR 2,884.9 million and a profit for the year
of EUR 37.3 million.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and consolidated financial position as
at 31 December 2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

**Basis for unqualified opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium. Furthermore, we
have applied the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as approved by the IAASB for the year-end and which are not yet
approved at the national level. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts” section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium, including the
requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information necessary for performing
our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### EMPHASIS OF MATTER - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

As far as the outbreak of COVID 19 is concerned, we draw your attention to page 65 of the directors' report and section 7.32
("Subsequent events") of the consolidated financial statements in which the board of directors expresses their view that, although
the consequences thereof may have a significant impact on the Group's operations in 2020, such consequences do not have a
material impact on the Group's financial position for the year ended 31 December 2019. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of
this matter.

###### KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**1. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex carries a significant value of goodwill on the balance sheet amounting to EUR 1,171.2 million as detailed in disclosure 7.9.
Under the International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the
amount of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets for impairment at least annually. We consider this matter to be of
most significance because of the complexity of the assessment process and significant judgments in respect of assumptions about
the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. The most important assumptions
relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and operating margin. We focused on the goodwill, intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment of the Cash Generating Unit (further CGU) Americas because it is most sensitive to changes in key
assumptions.


-----

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged if the goodwill impairment test was performed at the lowest CGU level at which the goodwill is monitored. We
challenged the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We found
that the projected cash flow for 2020 were consistent with the Board approved budgets, which were subject to timely oversight
and challenge by the Directors. We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of
business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the Group’s actual performance. For the cash flows after 2020 we
critically assessed and checked the assumptions related to the long-term growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts
and historical growth rates. We compared the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) to the cost of capital and debt of the
Group and comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the calculation method used and
the accuracy thereof. We compared operating margin, working capital- and CAPEX percentage with past actuals. We challenged
the adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these
assumptions would need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered. We discussed the likelihood of such a
movement with management. We included valuation specialists in our team to assist us with these procedures. We also assessed
the adequacy of the disclosures (Note 7.9 and Note 7.4.3) in the financial statements.

**Our results**

From our sensitivity analysis, we found the likelihood of changes resulting in impairment losses to be unlikely.

**2. Valuation of deferred taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to tax**

**losses carried forward**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex has recognised a deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability of respectively EUR 29.3 million and EUR 34.7 million. EUR
124.1 million deferred tax asset position was not recognised, as disclosed in Note 7.19. Ontex recognised in 2019 EUR 0.2 million
deferred tax assets on previously unrecognised tax losses, while EUR 12,1 million deferred tax asset positions on tax losses of
2019 were not recognised as disclosed in Note 7.27. The valuation of the deferred tax positions at Ontex involved significant
judgement, more specifically in the determination of the recognition of deferred tax assets related to tax losses carried forward.
The estimation of the future taxable basis is highly judgemental as well as the assessment of the impact of tax laws and
regulations, tax planning action and strategies, rulings and transfer pricing. Because of all the aforementioned reasons, we found
this key audit matter to be of most significance for our audit.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged the assumptions made to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to tax losses carried forward and
the timing of the reversal of deferred tax positions. During our procedures, we used amongst others budgets, forecasts and tax
laws and in addition we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s assumptions. We involved tax specialists in our audit.
An important management judgement was the period over which taxable profits can be reliably estimated and consequently, no
deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses used in any period beyond. We verified that the deferred tax position was
calculated at the enacted tax rate for the year in which the deferred tax position is expected to reverse.

We also assessed the adequacy and completeness of the Company’s disclosure included in

Note 7.4.1, 7.19 and 7.27 in respect of deferred taxes.

**Our results**

We found management’s judgements in respect of the Group’s deferred tax positions to be consistent and in line with our
expectations.

**3. Accounting for accruals for sales incentives and purchase related incentives**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Trade discounts and volume rebates related to both sales and purchases are subject to judgmental estimates and assessments
of the impact of commercial negotiations which take place after year-end. The impact of commercial negotiations is material and
hence of most significance for our audit. Ontex calculates an estimate of final incentives based on the information available until
the financial statements are established. Incentives related to sales are reported as deduction of Group’s revenue. Purchase
discounts are recorded as a deduction of the initial purchase.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We have agreed the discount percentages or lump sum payments to underlying customer and purchase agreements, we
recalculated the accrual and challenged the estimated impact of commercial negotiations taking into account the results. We also
performed back-testing on the accruals per 31 December 2018. We also reviewed credit notes and other adjustments to trade
receivables and trade payables after 31 December 2019 as part of our work around subsequent events. Finally we have audited
manual journal entries related to discounts in order to confirm that sufficient documentation and suitable attestations exist for
these entries.

**Our results**

Our work did not identify findings that are significant for the financial statements as a whole.


-----

**Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and fair view in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements
applicable in Belgium, and for such internal control as the board of directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the board of directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the audit of the consolidated
accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any certainty as to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or
effectiveness of the Board of Directors’ current and future business management.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout
the audit. We also:

  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.

  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the board of directors.

  Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our statutory auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue
as a going concern.

  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and
whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

  Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors and with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

We also provide the board of directors and the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the board of directors and with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the directors’ report on the
consolidated financial statements, the separate report on non-financial information and the other information included in the report
on the consolidated financial statements and to report on these matters.*

**Aspects related to the directors’ report on the consolidated financial statements and to the other**
**information included in the annual report on the consolidated financial statements**

statements, this report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements for the year under audit, and it is prepared in
accordance with article 3:32 of the Companies’ and Associations’ Code.

In the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we are also responsible for considering, in particular based on
the knowledge acquired resulting from the audit, whether the directors’ report is materially misstated or contains information which
is inadequately disclosed or otherwise misleading. In light of the procedures we have performed, there are no material
misstatements we have to report to you.

The non-financial information required by virtue of article 3:32, §2 of the Companies’ and Associations’ Code is included in the
directors’ report on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has prepared the non-financial information, based on

we do not express an opinion as to whether the non-financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Global
Reporting Initiative Standards as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

**Statement related to independence**

  Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the statutory audit of the
consolidated financial statements, and our registered audit firm remained independent of the Group in the course of our
mandate.

  The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements
referred to in article 3:65 of the Companies’ and Associations’ Code are correctly disclosed and itemized in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements.

**Other statements**

This report is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the Regulation (EU)
N° 537/2014.

###### 7. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 7.1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

**7.1.1. Introduction**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the period from January 1, 2019 to December
31, 2019 are consistent with those applied in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018
of Ontex Group NV, except for the introduction of the new requirements applied to lease agreements as a result of the application
of IFRS 16 – Leases (see below). The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.

**7.1.2. Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of the Ontex Group NV for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared in
compliance with IFRS (“International Financial Reporting Standards”) as adopted by the European Union. These include all IFRS
standards and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective as at December 31, 2019. The new standards, amendments to standards
and interpretations that are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning January 1, 2019, did not have a significant
impact, except for IFRS 16. No new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations were early adopted, except for the
amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 related to the IBOR Reform.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial
instruments for which fair value is used (such as derivative instruments).

These financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and on the assumption that the entity is in going concern and will
continue in operation in the foreseeable future.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Group accounting policies. The areas involving a higher
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in note 7.4.

**IFRS accounting standards to be adopted as from 2019 and onwards**

The following relevant new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and endorsed by the European
Union and are mandatory for the first time for the financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019:

IFRS 16 – Leases (effective January 1, 2019): IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 – Leases and related interpretations. For lessees,
IFRS 16 requires most leases to be recognized on-balance (under a single model), eliminating the distinction between operating
and finance leases. In accordance with the new standard, the lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and
obligations created by leases. The standard increases interest-bearing liabilities and non-current assets (new class “Right-of-use
assets”) in the consolidated financial statements of the Ontex Group. In addition, the rental expenses recognized in profit or loss
will decrease and depreciation and amortization as well as interest expenses will increase. As a result of these impacts, EBITDA
will be impacted significantly. However, operating result and net result (profit of the period) will only be impacted to a limited extent.

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (effective January 1, 2020, but early adopted):
The amendments deal with issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of an existing interest rate
benchmark with an alternative interest rate and address the implications for specific hedge accounting requirements.

Amendments to IAS 19 – _Employee Benefits (effective January 1, 2019): The amendments clarify that if a plan amendment,_
curtailment or settlement occurs, it is now mandatory that the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the
remeasurement are determined using the assumptions used for the remeasurement.

Annual improvements 2015-2017 (effective January 1, 2019): The Improvements contain amendments to four standards as a
result of the IASB's annual improvements project. Amendments to IFRS 3 – _Business Combinations and IFRS 11 –_ _Joint_
_Arrangements clarify the definition of a business and the accounting for previously held interests. The amendment to IAS 12 –_
_Income Taxes clarify that all income tax consequences of dividends (i.e. distribution of profits) should be recognized in profit or_
loss, regardless of how the tax arises and finally, the amendment to IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs clarify the accounting for specific
borrowings which remain outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale.

IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective January 1, 2019): This Interpretation sets out how to determine
the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Group has performed an assessment of its
uncertain tax positions and the application of IFRIC 23 is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the future consolidated
financial statements. The Group applies these new guidelines retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the
interpretation recognized on January 1, 2019 (modified retrospective approach) in accordance with the transition requirements of
IFRIC 23. As such, the Group restated its opening balance of equity as a result of initially applying the principles of IFRIC 23 for
an amount of € 2.5 million.

The above-mentioned standards did not have an impact on the financial statements, except for IFRIC 23 (see impact above) and
IFRS 16:


-----

The Ontex Group applied the new guidelines for lease accounting retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the standard recognized on January 1, 2019 (modified retrospective approach) in accordance with the transition requirements of
IFRS 16. The comparative statements have not been restated.

Upon transition, the Group used following practical expedients authorized by the standard:

  Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

  Excluding initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application;

  Using hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease;

  Not reassessing whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application, for contracts entered into
before January 1, 2019;

  Relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to performing an impairment review –
there were no onerous contracts as at January 1st, 2019

For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (mainly IT equipment and small office
furniture), the Group has opted to recognize a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16 over the lease term.

Following the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group has changed its accounting policy for leases. The new policy is described below.

The impact of the changes in accounting policies impacts only the opening balance of equity (reversal of operating lease incentives
recognized previously as deferred income) and the opening balance of the statement of financial position. As a result of the
application of the revised accounting policies due to the application of IFRS 16 on a modified retrospective basis, the Group
recognized lease liabilities for an amount of € 148.0 million relating to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS
17. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019.

The related right-of-use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted for the outstanding balance of
accrued rental expenses and an initial estimate of restoration and dismantling costs amounting to € 0.3 million and the outstanding
balance of assets relating to favorable lease contracts acquired as part of past business combinations.

The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the
lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes

Leases classified under IAS 17 as finance leases were previously presented a part of property, plant and equipment (2018: € 6.5
million) and are, as from 2019, presented as part of the new line item “Right-of-use assets” in the statement of financial position.
No contracts have been assessed to be onerous at transition date.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used at transition date is 4.56%.

Following table presents a reconciliation between the note disclosing the non-cancellable lease commitments as reported in the
2018 consolidated financial statements and the lease liabilities recognized at transition date:


**in € million**


**Operating lease commitment as disclosed in the**
**160.9**
**2018 consolidated financial statements**

Recognition exemption
Short term leases (1.6)
Leases of low value assets (5.1)
Contracts excluded as not in scope of IFRS 16 (0.9)
Extension and termination options reasonably certain to be exercised 28.0
**Total lease commitments in scope of IFRS 16 per December 31, 2018** **181.3**
Discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019 (33.3)

**Lease liabilities recognized at January 1, 2019** **148.0**

**Relevant IFRS accounting pronouncements to be adopted as from 2020 onwards**

A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and annual improvement cycles have been published and are
mandatory for the first time for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and have not been early adopted. Those
which may be the most relevant to the Ontex Group’s consolidated financial statements are set out below, but are expected not
to have a significant impact on the Ontex’ consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business (effective January 1, 2020, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments aim
to assist companies to determine whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets.

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material (effective January 1, 2020): The amendments clarify the definition of
“material” and align the definition used in the Conceptual Framework and the standards.

**7.1.3. Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is established when the Group is exposed, or has the rights,
to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity
interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration agreement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at acquisition
date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.

The excess of the consideration of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealized
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.

**Transactions with non-controlling interests**

The Group treats the transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases
from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value
of the net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses on disposal to non-controlling interests are also recorded
in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value,
with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income
are reclassified to profit or loss.

**7.1.4. Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Separately recognized goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

The goodwill recognized in the statement of financial position is allocated to four Cash Generating Units (CGUs). These CGUs
are Europe, Healthcare, Middle East, Africa and Asia and Americas. They represent the lowest level within the entity at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This is in line with the centralized business model that was implemented
during 2010.

**7.1.5. Foreign currencies**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro,
which is the Group’s presentation currency.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income
statement.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to interest-bearing debts and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within ‘Net finance cost’. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement
within ‘Other operating income/(expenses), net’.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. Items of income and expense are translated at the monthly average
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions), and equity
items are translated at historical rates. The resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

USD 1.1234 1.1196 1.1450 1.1814

**7.1.6. Intangible assets**

An intangible asset is recognized on the statement of financial position when the following conditions are met: (1) the asset is
identifiable, i.e. either separable (if it can be sold, transferred, licensed) or it results from contractual or legal rights; (2) it is probable
that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; (3) the Group can control the
resource; and (4) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets are carried at acquisition cost (including the costs directly attributable to the transaction) less any accumulated
amortizations and less any accumulated impairment losses.

Within the Group, internally generated intangibles represent IT projects and product/process development projects.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique projects controlled by the
Group are recognized as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

  it is technically feasible to complete the project so that it will be available for use

  management intends to complete the project and use or sell it

  there is an ability to use or sell the project

  it can be demonstrated how the project will generate probable future economic benefits

  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the project are available,
and

  the expenditure attributable to the project during its development can be reliably measured.

The Group’s systems allow a reliable measure of expenses directly attributable to the different IT and product/process
development projects.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria above are recognized as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period.

Externally acquired software is carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated amortization and less any accumulated
impairment loss.

Maintenance costs as well as the costs of minor upgrades whose objective is to maintain (rather than increase) the level of
performance of the asset are expensed as incurred.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and or production of a qualifying intangible asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

Intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life, using the straight-line method. The applicable useful
lives are:

**Intangible assets**
Brands 20 years

IT implementation costs 5 years

Capitalized development costs 3 to 5 years

Licenses 3 to 5 years

Acquired concessions, patents, know-how, and other similar rights 5 years

Amortization commences only when the asset is available for use.


-----

**7.1.7. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment loss. Acquisition cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended
use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and/or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

Expenditure on repair and maintenance which serve only to maintain, but not increase, the value of fixed assets is charged to the
income statement. However, expenditure on major repair and major maintenance, which increases the future economic benefits
that will be generated by the fixed asset, is identified as a separate element of the acquisition cost. The cost of property, plant and
equipment is broken down into major components. These major components, which are replaced at regular intervals and
consequently have a useful life that is different from that of the fixed asset in which they are incorporated, are depreciated over
their specific useful lives. In the event of replacement, the component is replaced and removed from the statement of financial
position, and the new asset is depreciated up until the next major repair or maintenance.

The depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset, using the straight-line method. The
depreciable amount is the acquisition cost, less residual value, if any. The applicable useful lives are:

**Property, plant and equipment**
Land N/A

Land improvements and buildings 30 years

Plants, machinery and equipment 10 to 15 years

Furniture and vehicles 4 to 8 years

Other tangible assets 5 years

IT equipment 3 to 5 years

The useful life of the machines is reviewed regularly. Each time a significant upgrade is performed, such upgrade extends the
useful life of the machine. The cost of the upgrade is added to the carrying amount of the machine and the new carrying amount
is depreciated prospectively over the remaining estimated useful life of the machine.

**7.1.8. Leases**

The Group leases several properties, machinery, vehicles and IT equipment. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and
corresponding liability at the date of which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present
value of the following lease payments:

  fixed payments (less any lease incentives),

  variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate,

  the exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and

  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined, or the
Group’s incremental borrowing rate, i.e. the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with
a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment.

The group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included
in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease
liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the remaining
balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,

  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received,

  any initial direct costs, and

  an estimate of the costs related to the dismantling and removal of the underlying asset.


-----

  If it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the asset shall be depreciated on a straight-line
basis over its useful life (see property, plant and equipment above). In all other circumstances the asset is depreciated on
a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

  For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) or leases of low-value items (mainly IT equipment and small office
furniture) to which the Group applies the recognition exemptions available in IFRS 16, lease payments are recognized on
a straight-line basis as an expense over the lease term.

  Some property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to the use of the property (mainly warehouses).
Variable lease payments that depend on the use are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that
triggers those payments occurs.

**7.1.9. Impairment of non-financial assets, other than goodwill**

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization, but are
tested annually for impairment.

Other assets which are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value
in use.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the production costs, like raw materials, direct labor, and also the
indirect production costs (production overheads based on normal operating capacity). Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.

Spare parts held by the Group are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are expected to be used in more than one
period and if they are specific to a single machine. If they are not expected to be used in more than one period or if they can be
used on several machines, they are classified as inventory. For the spare parts classified as inventory, the Group uses write-down
rules based on the economic use of these spare parts.

**7.1.11. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations**

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For a sale to be highly probable, management
should be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan
should be initiated, the asset (or disposal group) should be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its current
fair value, the sale should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and actions required to
complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.

A disposal group is a group of assets to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, together as a group in a single transaction, and
liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The group includes goodwill acquired in
a business combination if the group is a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, or if it is an operation within
such a cash-generating unit.

When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a noncontrolling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. Any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell is recognized as an
impairment loss. Depreciation of such assets is discontinued as from their classification as held for sale. Prior period consolidated
statements of financial position are not restated to reflect the new classification of a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held
for sale.

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group which the Group has disposed of or which is classified as held for sale,
and which:

  represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;

  is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or

  is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

**7.1.12. Revenue recognition**

Ontex Group’s core activity is the sale of goods with as only performance obligation the delivery of goods. As such, the Group
recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.
The Group sells its products to its customers directly, through distributors or agents. This can result in a different moment to
recognize revenue. Following delivery to distributors, the distributor has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to
sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when selling the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to
the goods.

Next to the sale of goods, distinct services – mainly customer training or customer assistance services – are rendered
predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer. Transportation (shipping) is not be
considered as a separate performance obligation as control over the goods is only transferred to the customer after the shipment.

Payment terms can differ depending on the customer, based on the credit risk and prior payment behavior of the customer. In
addition, the geographical location of the company and the customer have an effect on the payment terms. There are no significant
financing components in the transaction prices and the considerations are paid in cash.

Customer contracts include trade discounts or volume rebates, which are granted to the customer if the delivered quantities
exceed a certain threshold. In these cases, the transaction price includes a variable consideration. The effect of the variable
consideration on the transaction price is taken into account in revenue recognition by estimating the probability of the realization
of the discount or rebate for each contract. Furthermore, the estimated variable consideration is included in the transaction price
only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved (constraining the variable consideration).
Furthermore, the Group considers all payments made to customers and whether these are related to the revenue generated from
the customer.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because
only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

**7.1.13. Financial assets**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value and financial assets at amortized
cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the
cash flows. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell an asset.

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of
financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets (such as loans, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents) are subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment if they are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all
fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on
initial recognition.

Trade and other receivables after and within one year are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized
cost, i.e. at the net present value of the receivable amount, using the effective interest rate method, less allowances for impairment.

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized
cost. For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

The amount of the allowance is deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the income statement within
‘Sales and marketing expenses’.

Trade receivables are no longer recognized when (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the trade receivables have expired, (2)
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards related to the receivables.

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset,
the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the
financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.


-----

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity is recognized in profit or loss.

On de-recognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to repurchase part of a
transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to
recognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts
on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the
sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognized and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been
recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in
other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is no longer
recognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

**7.1.14. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of
financial position.

**7.1.15. Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (treasury
shares), the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the company until the shares are cancelled or
reissued. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.

Financial instruments, such as the Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs), are either classified as financial liabilities
or equity. The financial instrument is included in equity if, and only if, the instrument does not include a contractual obligation to
deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or liabilities under conditions that are potentially unfavorable
to the Group, and if the instrument will or may be settled in a fixed number of the Group’s own equity instruments.

**7.1.16. Government grants**

Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the assets to which they
relate and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

**7.1.17. Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are recorded as an expense in the income statement in the period in which the services have been
rendered. Any unpaid compensation is included in ‘Employee benefit liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.

**Post-employment benefits**

Group companies operate various pension schemes. Most of the schemes are unfunded. Some schemes are funded through
payments to insurance companies or pension funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined
benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit
plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit
that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. The net interest cost relating to the defined benefit plans is recognized
within financial expenses.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.


-----

**Long-term employee benefits**

Unfunded obligations arising from long-term benefits are provided for using the projected unit credit method.

**Termination benefits**

Early termination obligations are recognized as a liability when the Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ to terminating the
employment before the normal retirement date. The Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ when, and only when, it has a detailed
formal plan for the early termination without realistic possibility of withdrawal. Where such benefits are long term, they are
discounted using the same rate as above for defined benefit obligations.

**7.1.18. Share-based payments**

The Group operates an equity settled share-based compensation plan, consisting of stock options (hereafter ‘options’), restricted
stock units (‘RSU’) and performance stock units (‘PSU’). For grants of options, RSU’s and PSU’s, the fair value of the employee
services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted on the date of the grant. The Group
recognizes the fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the options as an expense and a corresponding
increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the options granted is determined using option
pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the share price at date of grant of the option, the risk-free
interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Vesting conditions
included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value except where those terms relate to market
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered by adjusting the number of shares or options included in the
measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately the amount recognized in the income statement reflects the
number of vested shares or options.

At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable
and recognizes the impact of revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to
equity over the remaining vesting period.

When the instruments are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share
capital (nominal value) and share premium.

The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the instruments is considered an integral part of the grant
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.

**7.1.19. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when (I) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (II) it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; (III) and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
considering the class of obligations as a whole.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in
the provision due to passage of time is recognized as finance cost.

If the Group has an onerous contract, it will be recognized as a provision. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination
penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

A provision for restructuring is only recorded if the Group demonstrates a constructive obligation to restructure at the balance
sheet date. The constructive obligation should be demonstrated by: (a) a detailed formal plan identifying the main features of the
restructuring; and (b) raising a valid expectation to those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement
the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.

**7.1.20. Income taxes**

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the
reporting period in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. In line with paragraph 46
of IAS 12 Income taxes, management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts
expected to be paid to the tax authorities. This evaluation is made for tax periods open for audit by the competent authorities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements.


-----

However, the deferred tax is not recognized for:

  the initial recognition of goodwill;

  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and

  deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for
deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for taxable temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for tax losses and tax attributes to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred taxes are calculated at the level of each fiscal entity in the Group. The Group is able to offset deferred tax assets and
liabilities only if the deferred tax balances relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

**7.1.21. Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are classified as at amortized cost, except for derivative
instruments (see 7.1.21 below).

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting
period.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including
all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums
or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount
on initial recognition.

When a financial liability measured at amortized cost is modified without this resulting in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash
flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

A limited part of trade payable is subject to reverse factoring. As the main risk and rewards of the trade payable remain with the
Group, the financial liability is not de-recognized from trade payables.

**7.1.22. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate
and commodity price risks and equity price risks associated with share-based payments, including foreign exchange forward
contracts, commodity hedging contracts and interest rate CAP’s and SWAP’s and a total return swap.

Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument,
in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

The fair values of various derivative instruments are disclosed in note 7.5 ‘Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management’.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is
more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

If no hedge accounting is applied, the Group recognizes all gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives in
the consolidated income statement within Other operating income/expense to the extent that they relate to operating activities
and within Net finance cost to the extent that they relate to the financing activities of the Group (e.g. interest rate swaps relating
to the floating rate borrowings).

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

**7.1.23. Hedge accounting**

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk and commodities,
as cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.


-----

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized
in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss and is included in the ‘other operating income/(expense)' line item.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the
periods when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated income statement as the
recognized hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction
is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated
in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.24. Operating segments**

The Group’s activities are in one segment. There are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate.
The chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors, reviews the operating results (defined as EBITDA) and operating
plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis; therefore, the Group operates as one segment.

**7.1.25. Statement of cash flows**

The cash flows of the Group are presented using the indirect method. This method reconciles the movement in cash for the
reporting period by adjusting net profit of the year for any non-cash items and changes in working capital, and identifying investing
and financing cash flows for the reporting period.

###### 7.2. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Alternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in the financial communication of the Group since management believes
that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of
performance and liquidity. The alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results, our performance or our liquidity under IFRS.

**7.2.1. Non-recurring income and expenses**

Income and expenses classified under the heading “non-recurring income and expenses” are those items that are considered by
management not to relate to transactions, projects and adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities taking place in the ordinary
course of activities of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses are presented separately, due to their size or nature, so
as to allow users of the consolidated financial statements of the Company to get a better understanding of the normalized
performance of the Company. Non-recurring income and expenses relate to:

  acquisition-related expenses;

  changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context of business combinations;

  changes to the Group structure, business restructuring costs, including costs related to the liquidation of subsidiaries and
the closure, opening or relocations of factories;

  impairment of assets and major litigations.

Non-recurring income and expenses of the Group for the years ended December 31 are composed of the following items
presented in the consolidated income statement and can be reconciled in note 7.24:

  income/(expenses) related to changes to Group structure; and

  income/(expenses) related to impairments and major litigations.


-----

**7.2.2. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance cost, income taxes, depreciations and amortizations. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2019** **2018**
**Operating profit** **87.2** **152.8**

Depreciation and amortization 87.6 56.9

**EBITDA** **174.8** **209.7**

Non-recurring income and expenses 70.3 24.3

**Adjusted EBITDA** **245.1** **234.0**

**7.2.3. Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio (Leverage)**

Net financial debt is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and deducting cash and cash equivalents.

LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses for the last twelve months (LTM).

Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of the Group for the years ended December 31 are presented in note 7.3 ‘Capital
Management’.

**7.2.4. Free Cash Flow**

Free cash flow was previously defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (Capex, defined as purchases of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets), less change in working capital, less income taxes paid. This means that operating
lease payments were included in the Free cash flow.

As a result of the application of IFRS 16, lease payments will be reported as cash flows from financing activities. Considering that
operationally nothing has changed and IFRS 16 is only an accounting change, the definition of free cash flow is adjusted to include
the repayment of lease liabilities (i.e. excluding the interest expense).

Furthermore, the Group decided to disclose from now on Free cash flow instead of Adjusted free cash flow in order to facilitate
the reading and the reconciliation with the consolidated cash flow statement. As such, free cash flow is defined as net cash
generated from operating activities (as presented in the consolidated cash flow statement, i.e. including income taxes paid) less
capital expenditures (Capex, defined as purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets), less repayment of
lease liabilities and including cash (used in)/from disposal.

Free Cash Flow of the Group for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2019** **2018**
**Operating profit** **87.2** **152.8**

Depreciation and amortization 87.6 56.9

**EBITDA** **174.8** **209.7**

Non-cash items in cash flows from operating activities 30.3 7.5

Change in working capital

Inventories 49.8 (39.9)

Trade and other receivables and prepaid expenses 44.4 24.5

Trade and other payables and accrued expenses (25.1) 4.4

Employee benefit liabilities 7.0 2.6

**Cash from operating activities before taxes** **281.3** **208.8**

Income taxes paid (42.3) (39.1)

**Net cash generated from operating activities** **239.0** **169.7**

Capex (103.9) (103.8)

Cash (used in)/from on disposal 2.2 2.6

Repayment of lease liabilities (27.6) (2.4)

**Free cash flow** **109.7** **66.1**


-----

**7.2.5. Adjusted Basic Earnings and Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share**

Adjusted Basic Earnings (or Adjusted Profit) are defined as profit for the period plus non-recurring income and expenses and tax
effect on non-recurring income and expenses, attributable to the owners of the parent. Adjusted Basic Earnings per share are
defined as Adjusted Basic Earnings divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share for the years ended December 31 are presented in note 7.16 ‘Earnings per share’.

**7.2.6. Working Capital**

The components of our working capital are inventories, trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other receivables plus trade
payables and accrued expenses and other payables.

**7.2.7. Alternative Performance Measures included in the Press releases and other Regulated**

**information**

**Pro-forma revenue at constant currency**

Pro-forma revenue at constant currency is defined as revenue for the 12 months period ending on the reporting date at prior year
foreign exchange rates and inclusive of impact of mergers and acquisitions.

**Like-for-Like (LFL) revenue**

Like-for-like revenue is defined as revenue at constant currency excluding change in scope of consolidation or M&A.

**Adjusted EBITDA margin**

Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

###### 7.3. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide benefits for shareholders.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt position. The Group’s net debt position is calculated by adding all short
and long-term interest-bearing debts and by deducting the available short-term liquidity.

The net debt positions of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Non-current interest-bearing debts 919.5 786.6

Current interest-bearing debts 69.6 104.0

Cash and cash equivalents (127.8) (130.6)

**Total net debt position** **861.3** **760.0**

LTM Adjusted EBITDA 245.1 234.0

**Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio** **3.51** **3.25**

The Group is subject to covenants, which are further disclosed in note 7.17.

###### 7.4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements involve the use of estimates and assumptions about the future.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual amounts may differ from
these estimates. The estimates and assumptions that could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are discussed
below.

**7.4.1. Income taxes**

The Group has tax losses and other tax incentives usable to offset future taxable profits, mainly in Belgium, Brazil, France and
Spain, amounting to € 583.0 million at December 31, 2019 (€ 378.4 million at December 31, 2018).

As mentioned in the 2018 consolidated financial statements, the European Commission challenged Belgium’s excess profit ruling
(EPR) system, characterizing this system as illegal state aid. Ontex, through its Belgian subsidiary Ontex BVBA, had an EPR
covering the years 2011-2015. Ontex has lodged an appeal against this EC decision. The General Court has handed down its
judgment on February 14, 2019 in the joint case of Belgium vs Commission and Magnetrol International vs Commission. The
General Court has annulled the Commission’s Decision for the reason that the Commission erroneously considered that the
excess profit exemption system constituted an aid scheme. The European Commission has appealed the decision of the General
Court to the European Court of Justice and we await the outcome.

Furthermore, the European Commission announced on September 16, 2019 that it was opening formal investigations into each
of the individual EPRs including that of Ontex, as it believes that each EPR grants illegal state aid, even if the EPR system does


-----

not. The formal investigation into the Ontex EPR continues and it is unclear when a final decision can be expected. Ontex will
have the right to appeal against any decision that concludes the Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid. Any such appeal will take
some time to be heard.

Ontex had fully taken into account the impact of the Commission’s appeal that the EPR system is illegal state aid being successful,
and the Commission concluding that the Ontex EPR grants illegal state aid in its tax position. Since the outcome of both challenges
is not yet final, Ontex will not release the relevant provisions at this stage.

The Group has only recognized deferred tax assets on € 142.5 million of tax losses and other tax incentives out of the € 583.0
million mentioned above. The measurement of these deferred tax assets depends on a number of judgmental assumptions
regarding the future probable taxable profits of different Group subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. These estimates are made
prudently to the extent of the best current knowledge.

The Group applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments. Since the Group operates in a
complex multinational environment, it assesses whether certain uncertain tax provisions should be recognized in its consolidated
financial statements (based on the requirements of IFRIC 23).

**7.4.2. Business combinations**

For business combinations, the Group must make assumptions and estimates to determine the purchase price allocation of the
business being acquired. To do so, the Group must determine the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and estimates have an impact on the asset and liability amounts recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on the acquisition date. In addition, the estimated useful lives of the acquired
property, plant and equipment, the identification of other intangible assets and the determination of the indefinite or finite useful
lives of other intangible assets acquired requires significant judgments and will have an impact on the Group’s profit or loss.

**7.4.3. Impairment**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note
7.1.4 “Goodwill”. The outcome of these goodwill impairment tests in 2019 did not result in an impairment loss (2018: nil).

As a result of the organizational restructuring, the Group has revisited its cash-generating units used for impairment testing. As
such, the Group identifies the following cash-generating units as from January 1[st], 2019:

  Europe (previously Mature Market Retail, plus Russia and Ukraine)

  Healthcare

  MEAA (Middle East, Africa and Asia; previously MENA, plus previous Growth Markets excluding Russia and Ukraine)

  Americas (previously Americas Retail)

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, demand and competition in the
markets where we operate, product offerings, product mix and pricing, raw materials availability and cost, direct and indirect
expenses, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditure and working capital, etc. as reflected in Ontex’ financial budgets
and strategic plans, as well as discount rates. For more details on the impairment test performed, we refer to note 7.9 ‘Goodwill
and intangible assets’. The discount rates used are summarized here below:

**in %** **Full Year**

**2019** **2018**

**Pre-tax discount rate**
Europe 6.1% 7.1%
Healthcare 6.4% 6.7%
Middle East, Africa and Asia 9.1% 11.7%
Americas 6.8% 9.5%

A sensitivity analysis indicates that the recoverable amount of Europe, Healthcare, Middle East Africa and Asia (MEAA) and
Americas would be equal to their carrying amount if the pre-tax discount rates of the CGUs were 10.9%, 19.8%, 17.5% and 10.2%,
respectively and all other variables kept constant.

As indicated in note 7.9, cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.0% for
Europe, 2.0% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MEAA and 3.6% for Americas. These same percentages are used as perpetual growth
rates. The growth rates have been determined by management but do not exceed the current market expectations in which the
four CGUs are currently operating. Should the growth rate for any of the CGUs decrease by 40%, no impairment would need to
be recognized.

Should the estimated operating margins decrease by 10%, no impairment would be recognized.


-----

Future cash flows are estimates that are likely to be revised in future periods as underlying assumptions change. Key assumptions
in supporting the value of goodwill include long-term interest rates and other market data. Should the assumptions vary adversely
in the future, the value in use of goodwill may reduce below their carrying amounts. Based on current valuations, headroom
appears to be sufficient to absorb a normal variation in the underlying assumptions.

**7.4.4. Expected useful lives**

The expected useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets must be estimated. The determination of the
useful lives of the assets is based on management’s judgment and it is reviewed at least at each financial year-end, pursuant to
IAS 16 and IAS 38.

**7.4.5. Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments**

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions
that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. All derivative financial instruments are, in
accordance with IFRS 7, level 2. This means valuation methods are used for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the
recorded fair value are observable in the market, either directly or indirectly.

**7.4.6. Employee benefits**

The carrying amount of the Group’s employee benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions.
One particularly sensitive assumption used for determining the net cost of the benefits granted is the discount rate. Any change
to this assumption will affect the carrying amount of those obligations.

The discount rate depends on the duration of the benefit, i.e. the average duration of the engagements, weighted with the present
value of the costs linked to those engagements. According to IAS 19, the discount rate should correspond to the rate of highquality corporate bonds of similar term to the benefits valued and in the same currency.

**7.4.7. Revenue recognition**

For the accrual for volume discounts (to customers and from suppliers) important judgements are made on the impact of
commercial decisions that will influence the final discount to be received or to be granted.

In the context of the Group’s financial risk management, the Group uses derivative instruments to cover specific risks, such as
foreign currency exposure, interest rate exposure and commodity price exposure. The following table presents an overview of the
derivative instruments outstanding at reporting date:

**in € million** **Fair value** **Nominal amounts**


**December 31,**


**December 31,**

_Forward foreign exchange contracts_ 2.5 0.2 106.9 30.1
_Commodity hedging contracts_ 0.5 0.2 8.5 2.9

The derivative instruments presented in the tables above are all designated in a cash flow hedge relationship (see below in notes
7.5.3 to 7.5.5).

The fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is exceeding
12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

The fair value of the derivatives is based on level 2 inputs as defined under IFRS 7.27, meaning inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).


-----

The above table provides an analysis of financial instruments grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair
value (recognized on the statement of financial position or disclosed in the notes) is observable:

  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities.

  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on mathematical models that use market observable data and
are determined as follows:

  The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid
markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed redeemable notes).

  The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a
discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for nonoptional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured
using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the
contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on
the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

  The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding those described above) are determined in
accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.

  Level 3 liabilities: the amount has been determined based on contractual agreements.

The Group has derivative financial instruments which are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and
similar agreements. No offsetting needed to be done per December 31, 2019 (nor 2018).

The counterparties of the outstanding derivative instruments have an A-credit rating.

**7.5.2. Financial risk factors**

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity
price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the risk management department since last year-end or in any risk management policies.

**7.5.3. Foreign exchange risk**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily
with respect to the British pound (GBP), the Turkish lira (TRY), the Polish zloty (PLN), the Australian dollar (AUD), the Mexican
peso (MXN), the Brazilian real (BRL) and Russian ruble (RUB) in relation to sales, and the US dollar (USD), the Czech koruna
(CZK), the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Brazilian real (BRL) in relation to procurement. Foreign exchange risk arises from future
commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Group also has exposures to the Turkish lira (TRY), Algerian
dinar (DZD), Russian ruble (RUB), Czech koruna (CZK), Australian dollar (AUD) Pakistani rupee (PKR), Mexican peso (MXN)
and Brazilian real (BRL) due to their net investments in foreign operations.

The carrying amounts of the Group's main foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of
the reporting period are as follows:

**in € million** **Assets** **Liabilities**

**December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**

EUR 1,895.8 1,976.1 2,589.2 2,711.9

AUD 29.6 29.0 17.1 15.4


-----

The Group monitors its foreign exchange exposure closely and will enter into hedging transactions if deemed appropriate to
minimize exposure throughout the Group to foreign exchange fluctuations. All hedging decisions are subject to approval of the
Board of Directors. The strategy regarding FX hedges was maintained.

To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, the Group
uses forward exchange contracts. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions, recognized assets and
liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Group treasury is responsible for optimizing
the net position in each foreign currency when possible and appropriate. The Group applies hedge accounting for the hedge
related transactions, the impact of the revaluation is recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Group has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts at the beginning of each quarter in 2019 maturing at the latest in
September 2020 in order to limit volatility in the business resulting from exposures to sales in British pound, Polish zloty, Australian
dollar as well as purchases in US dollar and Czech crown during 2019 and 2020. Based on the hedge strategy, the foreign
exchange forward contracts hedge the following forecasted exposures until September 30, 2020: for British pound (GBP) 37.5
million, for Polish zloty (PLN) 65.3 million, for Australian dollar (AUD) 25.0 million, for Czech crown (CZK) 159.3 million, for US
dollar (USD) 40.2 million versus EUR, US dollar (USD) 9.0 million versus Mexican peso (MXN) and US dollar (USD) 5.4 million
versus Brazilian real (BRL).

The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the highly probable forecast
transactions. The Group applies hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts. At inception, these instruments were
designated as cash flow hedges. At the moment the forecast transactions materialize, the foreign exchange forward contracts
become fair value hedges. As the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable
forecast transactions, there is no hedge ineffectiveness to be recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

As of December 31, 2019, an unrealized loss of € 2.2 million (Australian dollar, British pound, US dollar) have been recognized in
other comprehensive income.

As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the derivative financial asset for the foreign exchange contracts amounted to € 0.1
million (2018: € 2.0 million) and of the derivative financial liability amounted to € 2.5 million (2018: € 0.2 million).

The following table sets forth the impact on pre-tax profit and equity for the year of a 10% weakening/strengthening of the Euro
against the reported currency with all other variables held constant. The impact is mainly as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of foreign currency denominated trade receivables and payables and related derivative positions as at
the respective balance sheet dates.

PLN (1.6) - - 1.3 - USD (5.6) 2.0 2.8 4.6 (1.6) (2.3)

**7.5.4. Interest rate risk**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash
flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rate expose the Group to
fair value interest rate risk. These risks are managed centrally by Group treasury taking into account the expectations of the Group
with respect to the evolutions of the market rates. The Group has used interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps
to manage these risks.

Considering that the floating rate borrowings (EURIBOR + margin) are hedged through interest rate swaps, the interest expense
recognized in the consolidated income statement is not subject to interest rate volatility and therefore no sensitivity analysis has
been prepared.

_Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to loans: at December 31, 2019, if EURIBOR interest rates_
had been 10bps higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have
been respectively € 0.3 million higher / € 0.2 million lower. At December 31, 2018, if EURIBOR interest rates had been 10bps
higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively
€ 1.1 million higher / € 1.0 million lower.


-----

Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.75%.
Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan B due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.55%. Floating Rate
Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.40%. The notional principal
amounts of the outstanding fixed payer interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2019
are € 557.0 million as per below table:

**Duration** **Fixed interest rate %** **Amount in € million**
3 Year 0.3890% 85.0
3 Year 0.4950% 50.0
3 Year 0.6250% 75.0
3 Year 0.6290% 75.0
3 Year 0.6220% 75.0
3 Year 5.2574% 33.1
3 Year 5.3870% 4.5
3 Year 5.6561% 9.4
5 Year 0.5950% 150.0
**Total** **557.0**

**7.5.5. Price risk (commodity)**
The Group has some exposure to the price of oil because certain of the raw materials used in production are manufactured from
oil derivatives. These include glues, polyethylene, propylene and polypropylene.

In relation to our fluff and propylene exposure, the Group has arrangements with certain of their fluff suppliers that reduce our
exposure to volatility in fluff prices. The Group also decided to hedge a portion of the propylene exposure that is not covered by
such arrangements for 2019.

Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to commodities: at December 31, 2019 if there would be a
shift of the commodity forward curve by 10% increase/decrease with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other
comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively € 1.1 million higher / € 0.5 million lower (2018: impact was €
0.3 million higher/lower).

**7.5.6. Equity price risk**

Following the issuance of options and RSU’s as share-based payment arrangements under the different LTIP programmes (refer
to note 7.28 for details of these programs), the Group is exposed to variations in the Group share price. The Board of Directors of
the Group has decided on June 1, 2015 to implement a full hedging program through a total return swap. The purpose of this
financial instrument is to effectively hedge the risk that a price increase of the Ontex shares would negatively impact future cash
flows related to the share-based payments.

The Group entered into a total return swap (‘TRS’) agreement with a financial institution to manage its exposure to price volatility
related to the shares subject to the stock option and RSU plans as disclosed in note 7.28. Under the total return swap agreement,
the Company will pay interest to the financial institution. At the settlement of the TRS, the Group will receive the underlying shares
which will be granted to the beneficiaries of the stock options or RSU’s upon exercise. As such, the Group hedges the risk that
the share price would increase when shares have to be issued upon exercise by the beneficiaries of their options/RSUs/PSUs.
The shares bought in this context are recognized in deduction of Group equity at the strike price at the moment of entering into
the TRS. As the Group takes physical delivery of the shares upon settlement of the TRS (no net settlement), the TRS does not
meet the scope of financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 / IFRS 9. As such, the TRS should not be remeasured at fair
value at each closing date.

As a result, the Group recognized treasury shares for an amount of € 40.3 million (represented by 1,491,654 shares) and a related
financial liability for an amount of € 31.2 million (see note 7.15). These amounts do not require to be remeasured during the
contract time and consequently, all volatility has been eliminated.

**7.5.7. Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to corporate customers, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions. The Group assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial
position, past experience and other factors based on which individual risk limits are set in accordance with the limits set by
business managers. Historical default rates have been below 1% for 2019 and 2018. Trade receivables are spread over different
countries and counterparties and there is no large concentration with one or a few counterparties.

We refer to note 7.13 for the aging of the receivables and the doubtful receivables.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount as presented in the table above in the note
7.5.1.


-----

**7.5.8. Liquidity risk**

Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 7.17 Interest-bearing debts) at
all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on its borrowing facilities.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities (including interest payments) into relevant maturity groupings based on
the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

**in € million** **Less than** **Between 1** **Between 2** **Over 5 years**

###### 7.6. OPERATING SEGMENTS

According to IFRS 8, reportable operating segments are identified based on the “management approach”. This approach stipulates
external segment reporting based on the Group’s internal organizational and management structure and on internal financial
reporting to the chief operating decision maker. The Group’s activities are in one segment, “Hygienic Disposable Products”. There
are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate. The chief operating decision maker, the Board of
Directors, reviews the operating results and operating plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis.
Therefore, the Group operates as one segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about product sales, geographic areas and revenue
from major customers are presented below:

**7.6.1.** **Information by Division**

We have revamped our organization in order to better seize opportunities arising from our geographic expansion with the
establishment of new growth platforms in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, improve execution and bolster focus on our
competitive differentiators. The Company’s commercial activities are now organized in three Divisions:

  Europe, which is predominantly focused on retail brands

  Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia (AMEAA), which is predominantly focused on local brands

  Healthcare, which continues to focus on the institutional markets and dedicated incontinence brands

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2019** **2018**
Europe 956.9 1,020.7

AMEAA 891.9 835.8

Healthcare 432.5 435.6

**Total revenue** **2,281.3** **2,292.2**

The 2018 figures have been restated to reflect the change in divisional structure.

**7.6.2. Information by product group**

The key product categories are:

  Babycare products, principally baby diapers, baby pants and, to a lesser extent, wet wipes;

  Feminine care products, such as sanitary towels, panty liners and tampons;

  Adult incontinence products, such as adult pants, adult diapers, incontinence towels and bed protection.

**in € million** **Full Year**

Other 30.9 30.6

**Total revenue** **2,281.3** **2,292.2**

**7.6.3. Information by geographic area**

The organizational structure of the Group and its system of internal information indicates that the main source of geographical
risks results from the location of its customers (destination of its sales) and not the physical location of its assets (origin of its
sales). The location of Group’s customers is accordingly the geographical segmentation criterion and is defined as below:

  Western Europe

  Eastern Europe

  Americas

  Rest of the World

**in € million** **2019** **2018**

Distribution expenses 1.2 0.6
Sales and marketing expenses 1.8 1.9

**Total amortization expense** **9.2** **8.9**

The Group incurred € 8.9 million of research and development expenses in 2019 (2018: € 6.3 million) that has been recorded
under the caption ‘General and administrative expenses’.

No intangible assets have been pledged in the context of financial liabilities.

**Goodwill impairment**

As a result of the organizational restructuring, the Group has revisited its cash-generating units used for impairment testing. As
such, the Group identifies the following cash-generating units as from January 1st, 2019:

  Europe (previously Mature Market Retail, plus Russia and Ukraine)

  Healthcare

  MEAA (Middle East, Africa and Asia; previously MENA, plus previous Growth Markets excluding Russia and Ukraine)

  Americas (previously Americas Retail)

Annual impairment reviews are performed as at December 31 for all CGUs. These reviews compare the carrying value of each
CGU with the recoverable amount of the CGU’s assets calculated using a discounted cash flow model. If the recoverable amount
is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the income statement.

The judgments and estimates considered in the context of the impairment tests are disclosed in note 7.4.3.

Goodwill allocated to the CGUs as at December 31 was as follows:

**in € million** **2019** **2018**
Europe 757.7 757.7
Healthcare 60.4 60.4
MEAA 38.1 42.0
Americas 315.0 305.1

**Goodwill allocated to the CGU's** **1,171.2** **1,165.2**

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by means of value-in-use calculations. These calculations are based on pre-tax
cash flow projections (prepared in euros) using key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by Ontex’ Board
of Directors and the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2021. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an
estimated growth rate of 1.0% for Europe, 2.0% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MEAA and 3.6% for Americas. The growth rate does not
exceed the current market expectations in which the four CGUs are currently operating.

The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations used to determine the recoverable amount are those regarding the discount
rates, estimated changes to selling prices, product offerings, direct costs, operating margins and terminal growth rates.

The discount rate is a measure based on industry average weighted cost of capital and risk-free rates weighted for the different
regions in which the CGU’s are operating.

Changes in selling practices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The
calculation uses cash flow projections based on key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by the Board of
Directors, the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2021, and pre-tax discount rates for each CGU as described in note 7.4.3 Impairment
based on current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Group.

The development of the financial budget and Strategic Plan relies on a number of assumptions, including:

  The market growth, the evolution of the Group’s market share, competitive landscape and innovation trends in the different
markets as well as strategic initiatives.

  The product mix.

  The expected evolution of various direct and indirect expenses.

  The estimated future capital expenditure.


-----

The assumptions were derived mainly from:

  Available historic data.

  External market research.

  Internal market expectations based on trend reports, etc.

The key assumptions used are reviewed and updated on a yearly basis by the Group’s management. Taking into account the
considerable excess of the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount over its carrying amount, and based on sensitivity testing
performed, management is of the opinion that any reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on which the recoverable
amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount at December 31, 2019.

The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis by reducing the risk-adjusted cash flow projections and by increasing the pre-tax
discount rate as disclosed in note 7.4.3 Impairment.

The additions to property, plant and equipment represent mainly investments in capacity extension, investments in innovation,
investments to improve the efficiency and IT investments and include investments related to the Transform to Grow programme.

Impairment losses are mainly recognized in the context of the closure of the manufacturing operation in Aparecida de Goiânia,
which was started in May 2018 and continued in 2019.

The transfer to non-current assets held for sale relates to the building in Brazil.

The depreciation expense is included in the consolidated income statement as follows:

In the previous year, the Group only recognized leased assets relating to leases that were classified as ‘finance leases’ under IAS
17 Leases. These assets were presented in property, plant and equipment and have been reclassed to the right-of-use assets in
the opening carrying amount upon initial adoption of IFRS 16. Furthermore, also favorable leases recognized as intangible assets
have been reclassed to right-of-use assets in the opening carrying amount.

The consolidated income statement presents the following amounts relating to leases:

**in € million** **2019**
Cost of Sales 10.1

Distribution expenses 11.6

Sales and marketing expenses 2.3

General administrative expenses 4.7
**Total depreciation expense** **28.6**
Interest expense 6.9
Expense relating to short-term leases 10.5
Expense relating to leases of low-value assets 3.2
Expense relating to variable lease payments 4.3

The Group leases mainly plants and warehouses (lease terms between 3 and 25 years), machinery (lease terms of 5 years on
average) and company cars (lease terms between 4 and 5 years).

For the lease of land and buildings, the Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an
index, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index
or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used
to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group’s operations. As at December 31, 2019,
potential future cash outflows of € 21.4 million (undiscounted) have not been included in the lease liability because it is not
reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated).

The lease liabilities are detailed in note 7.17.


-----

###### 7.12. INVENTORIES

Inventories can be split as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Raw materials 147.8 169.3

Work in progress 1.0 1.1

Finished goods 181.4 204.2

Other 5.1 6.9

Write-down on inventories (16.6) (15.6)

**Inventories** **318.8** **365.9**

The Group mainly uses fluff, super-absorbers and non-woven fabrics. Other raw materials used by the Group for its production
include polyethylene, adhesives and tapes as basic raw materials. The finished products are baby diapers, baby pants, towels,
tampons, panty liners, incontinence products and trade goods.

The cost of inventories recognized as an expense and included under ‘Cost of sales’ amounted to € 1,661.3 million in 2019 (€
1,666.5 million in 2018).

###### 7.13. TRADE RECEIVABLES, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

The non-current other receivables include mainly non-current recoverable VAT.

The current trade and other receivables are detailed below:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Trade receivables 331.5 362.2
Less: allowance for impairment of trade receivables (7.3) (6.8)
**Trade receivables - net** **324.2** **355.4**
Prepayments 7.7 14.1
Other amounts receivable 41.4 55.0
**Prepaid expenses and other receivables** 49.1 **69.1**
**Trade and other receivables - Current** **373.3** **424.5**

Other amounts receivable include recoverable VAT for an amount of € 34.3 million for 2019 (2018: € 46.4 million). The fair value
of the current receivables approximates their carrying amounts.

The aging of the trade receivables (net) at December 31 is as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Not due 284.7 304.6
0 to 30 days 20.5 24.8
31 to 60 days 5.7 4.8
61 to 90 days 4.0 6.6
Over 90 days 9.3 14.6

**Total** **324.2** **355.4**

The Group doesn’t apply systematically external credit rating. An impairment analysis of trade receivables is done based on
expected losses, next to individual assessments, but there are no significant impairments.


-----

The carrying amount of the Group’s trade receivables (net) are denominated in the following currencies:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
EUR 92.9 101.9
BRL 42.1 53.2
PLN 42.7 45.7
MXN 44.0 50.0
USD 21.0 26.6
RUB 13.1 12.2
TRY 10.6 15.4
GBP 19.7 15.3
AUD 8.2 10.3
Other 29.9 24.8

**Total** **324.2** **355.4**

During the year, the payment terms for the receivables have neither deteriorated nor been renegotiated. The maximum credit risk
exposure at the end of the reporting period is the carrying value of each caption of receivables mentioned above. The Group does
not hold any collateral as security.

Movements on the Group allowance for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
**Opening Balance** **6.8** **5.5**
Allowance for receivable impairment 1.4 2.4
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible (0.9) (0.4)
Unused amounts reversed (0.1) (0.5)
Foreign exchange differences 0.1 (0.2)
**At December 31** **7.3** **6.8**

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract
assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The creation and the release of the allowance for impaired receivables have been included in ‘Sales and marketing expense’ in
the income statement.

The Group has entered into a Group non-recourse syndicate factoring agreement with BNP Paribas Fortis Factor and KBC
Commercial Finance. The Agreement provides us with a maximum credit facility of up to € 200 million and up to 95% of the amount
of the approved outstanding receivables on all debtors that we transfer to the Factor. The remaining 5% of the relevant receivables
is paid by the Factor to us upon receipt of payment from the relevant debtor, upon which also the remaining balance of the
receivable is derecognized. Financing per debtor is capped at 10% of the aggregate amount of all approved outstanding
receivables transferred to the Factor. Any financing within the credit limit is non-recourse to us. This factoring agreement is an offbalance sheet arrangement.

Next to the above-mentioned Group factoring agreement, Serenity (Italian subsidiary) entered into a bilateral factoring agreements
with Ifitalia and Banca Sistema. Furthermore, also Ontex Russia has entered into a bilateral factoring agreement with Rosbank
and Ontex Brazil has entered into a bilateral factoring agreements with Banco Safra and Banco Industrial. All these agreements
are non-recourse agreements.

As at December 31, 2019, € 149.1 million of financing was obtained through the factoring programs (€ 163.2 million in 2018), this
is in addition to € 12.3 million of financing was obtained through the use of supply chain financing programs offered by our
customers. The late payment risk related to the factoring has been assessed as immaterial at closing 2019 and 2018.

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments, all non-recourse trade receivables, included in these factoring programs, are
derecognized for the non-continuing involvement part.

###### 7.14. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The net cash position as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Short-term bank deposits (no longer than 3 months) 55.8 46.3
Cash at bank and on hand 72.1 84.3
**Total** **127.8** **130.6**


-----

The carrying amount of the cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

The credit quality of the banks and financial institutions the Group is working with is mentioned in the following table:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
AA 2.4 26.5
A 91.6 75.7
BBB 3.5 3.7
BB 11.0 19.5
B 11.7 C - 1.3
No credit rating 7.7 3.9

**Total** **127.8** **130.6**

###### 7.15. SHARE CAPITAL

The capital of € 1,208.0 million is represented by 82,347,218 shares, of which 1,491,654 treasury shares (2018: 1,559,874 treasury
shares). As such, the ordinary shares held by third parties amount to 80,855,564 shares (2018: 80,787,344).

The issued capital is fully paid and consists of ordinary shares without par value.

###### 7.16. EARNINGS PER SHARE

In accordance with IAS 33, the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to
ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The number
of shares used for 2019 was 80,804,164, which is the weighted average number of shares for 2019 (2018: 81,020,929 shares).

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent
(after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

In case of Ontex Group NV, no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders. The table below reflects
the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

**in € million** **Full Year**
**2019** **2018**
**Basic earnings**
Profit from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent 37.3 97.0
Adjustment dilution  -  Profit from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent, after dilution effect 37.3 97.0

**Adjusted Basic Earnings**
Profit from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent 37.3 97.0
Non-recurring income and expenses 70.3 24.3

Diluted earnings per share 0.46 1.20

Adjusted basic earnings per share 1.07 1.35

Adjusted diluted earnings per share 1.07 1.35

A weighted average number of 831,989 options were not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share as they
were out-of-the-money at year-end 2019 (2018: 393,672 options).

All borrowings are denominated in € as of December 31, 2019, except for one borrowing in MXN (€ 15.3 million) (2018: all in €).

On September 26, 2017, the Group entered into a syndicate credit facilities agreement (Syndicated Term Loan A) in an amount
of € 600.0 million, and a revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Facility B) in an amount of up to € 300.0 million. The Syndicated
Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.75%. The Senior Revolving
Facility B due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.55%, but was not used at closing 2019.

Furthermore, the Group has also closed a Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months
+ margin of 1.40%. This agreement also includes an accordion option of € 100 million, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR
3 months + margin of 1.40%.

As of December 31, 2019, € 300.0 million of the Senior Revolving Facility is undrawn (2018: € 217.6 million).


-----

On July 29, 2015, a full hedging program (total return swap) for the share-based payment arrangements (LTIP) was implemented.
For more information we refer to note 7.5.6 and 7.28.

This program was renewed in 2019. Total return swap decreased to an amount of 31.2 million (2018: € 33.0 million).

**7.17.1. Collateral for borrowings**

The Group is subject to regular information covenants, and certain financial ratios are monitored.

No assets have been pledged in the context of the syndicated term loans. However, certain subsidiaries act as guarantors for
these loans.

###### 7.18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES 

The Group grants its working and retired personnel post-employment benefits, long-term benefits, and termination benefits. These
benefits have been valued in conformity with IAS 19. The related IAS 19 liability recognized in the statement of financial position
can be analyzed as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Post-employment benefits 24.2 19.9
Long-term benefits 2.7 2.6
Termination benefits[1]  - 0.1

**Employee benefit liabilities** **26.9** **22.6**
Short-term employee benefit liabilities 55.1 47.9
**Net liability** **82.0** **70.4**

1The termination benefits include also the pre-pensions, but exclude the termination benefits included in the restructuring
provisions disclosed in note 7.21 below.

The calculation of the liability is based on actuarial assumptions that have been determined on the various balance sheet dates.
They are based not only on macro-economic factors valid for the dates in question but also on the specific characteristics of the
various schemes evaluated. They represent the Group’s best estimate for the future. They are periodically reviewed in accordance
with the evolution of the markets and available statistics.

**Post-employment benefits**

Ontex makes payments on a defined contribution basis to both state and private pension arrangements across our operations. In
addition, Ontex operates a defined benefit insurance scheme in Belgium and Ontex also has an obligation to make severance
payments to employees upon their retirement in France and Turkey.


-----

Ontex also operates several unfunded pension arrangements in respect of our German operations. The German operations do
not fund the pension arrangements but reflect pension scheme liabilities in company accounts on an IAS 19 basis. The pension
benefits are paid by the relevant company as they fall due.

The Group operates a couple of defined contribution (DC) plans which receive fixed contributions. The Group’s legal or
constructive obligation for these plans is limited to the contributions. The expense recognized in the current period in relation to
these contributions amounts to € 4.0 million (see also note 7.22 below; 2018: € 3.6 million).

In Belgium, the defined contribution (DC) plans are subject to a minimum guaranteed rate of return by law and are hence treated
as defined benefit (DB) plans. In practice, this guarantee is mainly covered by insurance companies. As there is no deficit as per
December 31, 2019, no liability has been recognized (2018: nil). The accumulated reserves of these plans are equal to the assets.
There are no risks to which the plan exposes the entity, focusing on any unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and of any
significant concentrations of risk.

There are no unusual entity-specific or plan-specific risks to which the plan exposes the entity, neither are there any significant
concentrations of risk.

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation
as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.

###### 7.19. DEFERRED TAXES AND CURRENT TAXES

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and when the deferred taxes relate
to the same fiscal authority. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

**in € million** **2019** **2018**


**Deferred tax**


**Deferred tax**

Financial instruments  - (17.5) 1.0  Employee benefits 6.6 - 1.0 Accrued expenses and other payables 21.5 - 2.7 Others 2.1  -  - (2.7)

Net deferred tax assets not recognized (124.1)  - (86.7)  Offsetting (67.7) 67.7 1.6 (1.6)

**Deferred tax assets & liabilities - Net** **29.3** **(34.7)** **26.5** **(49.9)**

Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differences, tax attributes carried forward and tax losses carried forward to the
extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.

The tax losses carried forward mainly relate to France, Belgium, Brazil and Spain. In Belgium and France, deferred tax assets
have been recognized on tax losses carried forward considering the expected taxable profits in the foreseeable future.

The Group did not recognize deferred tax assets of € 124.1 million (2018: € 86.7 million) on the tax losses carried forward (see
also note 7.4.1).

In Spain, this relates to tax losses at the level of the Spanish subsidiary acquired as part of Grupo Mabe. In Brazil this relates to
tax losses at the level of the Brazilian subsidiaries. In both countries, tax losses can in principle be carried forward indefinitely but
the current profit levels in the relevant entities are such that no deferred tax asset has been recognized per December 31, 2019,
bearing in mind that in Brazil no tax consolidation is allowed and that in Spain pre-acquisition tax losses cannot be offset against
profits of legacy Ontex entities.

The Group did not recognize deferred taxes associated with investments in subsidiaries. There is currently no policy or detailed
plan in relation to the payment of dividends within the Group.

**Current taxes**

**in € million** **December 31, 2019** **December 31, 2018**
Current tax assets 15.8 12.5
Current tax liabilities (39.4) (46.0)

The current tax assets mainly relate to the excess of pre-payments made compared to the actual income tax payable for the year.
The current tax liabilities include an amount of € 33.3 million actual corporate taxes payable (2018: € 35.6 million) and € 6.1 million
of provision for uncertain taxes (2018: € 10.4 million).

The restructuring provision has been established in the context of the Transform to Grow Programme, launched in 2018. The
provision mainly includes termination benefits. The additional provisions have been recognized in ‘Non-recurring income and
expenses’, under the heading ‘Business restructuring’ (see also note 7.24).

The Group recognizes a provision for certain legal claims filed against the Group by customers, suppliers or former employees.

On September 2, 2014, Ontex received a notification that the Spanish Competition Authorities (CNMC) opened infringement
proceedings against 15 companies in the sector (including three subsidiaries of the Company: Ontex Es Holdco, S.A., Ontex
Peninsular, S.A.U. and Ontex ID, S.A.U.) with respect to alleged conduct of fixing prices and other commercial conditions in the
Spanish market for heavy adult incontinence products. On May 26, 2016, following the investigation, the CNMC issued its decision.
In its decision it has found eight companies, including Ontex' Spanish subsidiaries guilty of being part of a cartel. For its
involvement from 1999 to 2014, Ontex was fined € 5.2 million. Ontex initiated an appeal against the decision and this appeal is
pending. As per December 31, 2016, a provision amounting to € 5.2 million has been accounted for. The provision has not been
adjusted per December 31, 2019.

Items classified under the heading non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are considered by management not
to relate to items in the ordinary course of activities of the Company. The Group has adopted this classification to allow a better
understanding of its recurring financial performance.

These items are presented as follows in the consolidated income statement as follows:

  income and expenses related to changes to Group structure; and

  income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations

**7.24.1. Income and expenses related to changes to Group structure**

**Factory closure**

On March 7, 2019, Ontex informed its employees at the Yangzhou (China) plant of its intention to cease production by mid-2019.
This plant primarily manufactures feminine care products for the Western European market, and this production will be re-allocated
to other Ontex plants. The costs recognized in 2019, € 1.5 million relates mainly to the restructuring expenses.

In 2018, the Group announced the decision to transfer its manufacturing operation in Aparecida de Goiânia to its manufacturing
site in Senador Canedo, both in the State of Goiás. This move was made after an in-depth analysis and considering the efficiency
of combining the entire production into a single unit, where it will be possible to deploy efficient technologies and processes. All
alternatives were investigated to minimize impact on Ontex employees in Aparecida de Goiânia, the majority of whom have
transferred to Senador Canedo.

The costs recognized relates mainly to the restructuring expenses (2019: € 1.4 million; 2018: € 5.9 million).

**Business restructuring**

The Group undertook several projects to optimize the management of its business.

The Group announced in May 2019 a comprehensive transformation plan, Transform2Grow (T2G), which will step-change the
operational efficiency and commercial practices. With T2G-enhanced commercial focus and competitiveness, the Group will
accelerate execution of our two strategic priorities: Strengthen the current leadership positions and expand into new businesses
and geographies within our core categories. The T2G plan entails an investment of € 130 million, split between one-off costs of €
85 million and Capex of € 45 million, with a full pay-back by the end of 2022.
The costs recognized in 2019 relate to in-depth assessments of the different processes and the start of the implementation of
different projects to increase the operational efficiency. Total expenses related to the execution of the projects amount to € 54.7
million in 2019.


-----

**Acquisition-related items**

In 2018, an income of € 5.0 million was realized as a result of the reversal of the liability relating to the deferred consideration for
the acquisition of Serenity as it is considered not probable. Furthermore, the Group incurred expenses relating to the continuing
integration of Grupo Mabe and Ontex Brazil in 2018 and 2019.

**7.24.2. Income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations**

**Impairment of assets**

The impairment loss is a non-cash item and relates in 2019 and 2018 (2019: € 7.6 million; 2018: € 8.8 million) mainly to the
impairment of assets as a result of the transfer of the manufacturing operation in Aparecida de Goiânia in Brazil to its
manufacturing site in Senador Canedo.

###### 7.28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Since September 2014 the Company implemented yearly Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIP’), which are based on a combination
of stock options (further ‘Options’) and restricted stock units (further ‘RSU’s’). In 2019 the long-term incentive plan changed in a
combination of RSU’s, Options and Performance Stock Units (further ‘PSU’s), each representing one third of the total long-term
incentive grant value. The Options, RSU’s and PSU’s are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments. The options,
RSU’s and PSU’s can only vest and Options giving the right to receive shares of the Company (further ‘Shares’) or any other
rights to acquire Shares can only be exercisable as from three years after the grant. The RSU, PSU and Options will vest subject
to the condition that the participant remains in service. The share price is considered to be the relevant performance indicator and
the vesting of the award will not be subject to additional specific performance conditions, except for PSU’s. For the vesting of the
PSU’s, the Board has set targets for the 2019-2021 performance period in terms of like-for-like sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA
and Earnings per share growth. The Articles of Association authorize the Company to deviate from such rule, as allowed under
the Belgian Companies Code.

The exercise price of the Options will be equal to the last closing rating of the Share immediately preceding the option grant date.
For the Options, the exercise period will start on the vesting date.

The Shares underlying the RSU’s and PSU’s will be granted for free as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the RSU’s
and the PSU’s.

Upon vesting of RSU’s and PSU’s, the Shares underlying the RSU’s and PSU’s are transferred to the participants, while upon
vesting, Options may be exercised until their expiry date (eight years from the date of grant).

On or about September 26, 2014, a total of 242,642 stock options and 49,040 RSU’s were granted, 74,244 options and 49,040
RSU’s have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2019. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable
between September 2017 and September 2022.

1 The average exercise price mentioned in the table above relates only to the stock options, as the RSU's do not have an exercise price.

² The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2019 was € 16.48 (2018: € 22.64).

The fair value of the stock options has been determined based on the Black and Scholes model. The expected volatility used in
the model is based on the historical volatility of the Company.

Below is an overview of all the parameters used in this model:

**LTIP 2014** **LTIP 2015** **LTIP 2016** **LTIP 2017** **LTIP 2018** **LTIP 2019**
Exercise Price (€) 17.87 26.60 28.44 33.11 23.56 14.00
Expected volatility of the shares (%) 23.58% 26.32% 26.56% 27.12% 25.63% 37.98%

Risk free interest rate (%) 1.13% 1.02% 0.37% 0.60% 0.69% 0.10%

The fair value of the RSU’s and PSU’s has been determined by deducting from the exercise price the expected and discounted
dividend flow, based on the same parameters as above.

Social charges related to the LTIP are accrued for over the vesting period.

###### 7.29. CONTINGENCIES

The Group is involved in a number of environmental, contractual, product liability, intellectual property, employment and other
claims and disputes incidental to our business.

COFECE, the Mexican antitrust authority, is conducting an investigation in our industry. To the best of the Group’s knowledge,
the facts under investigation relate to periods prior to its acquisition of Grupo PI Mabe, S.A. de C.V. (“Mabe”). Ontex and Mabe
have been proactively and fully cooperating with COFECE in the investigation and intend to continue to do so. Based on the facts
and circumstances known to it and in light of the contractual terms of the Mabe acquisition, the Group does not expect the
investigation to result in a net financial cost to it.

The Group currently believes that the disposition of the claims and disputes, individually or in aggregate, should not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

###### 7.30. COMMITMENTS 

**7.30.1. Capital commitments**

The Group has also contracted a number of property leases that can be terminated by respecting the notice period which is
different in each jurisdiction.

The Group leases machinery used in the production. The typical lease terms vary depending upon which country the lease
agreement is entered into. The majority of lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate.

From 1 January 2019, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for these leases, except for short-term and low-value leases,
see note 7.11 for further information.

###### 7.32. EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD 

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown
before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Ontex sales in China and other countries of the Far East are not
material, hence the outbreak of the virus in Asia had no significant impact on the financial performance of the Group at the
publication date of this report.

However, based on its assessment of the evolution and spreading of the virus, the World Health Organization characterized it as
a pandemic on March 11, 2020. We source several raw materials from suppliers all over the world and we deliver our products to
customers located in all regions of the world. Further spread of the coronavirus leading to restrictions in the movement of goods
and individuals could lead to disruptions to our supply chain and manufacturing organization, increased logistics costs and delayed
shipments to customers. At the moment of the publication of these consolidated financial statements, the impact of the current
spread of the virus on the financial performance of the Group is limited. We nevertheless will continue to monitor the situation
closely as continuing restrictions due to the virus could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and
performance in 2020. Based on our analysis and modelling using currently available information, as well as discussions with the
Management of Ontex, we believe the Company has taken the required measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on its
operations and strengthened its funding; even though visibility remains limited as the pandemic is still progressing, the going
concern is not considered to be at risk.

No other significant events occurred after the end of the reporting date which would affect the information mentioned in these
consolidated financial statements.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

 STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF THE COMPANY ONTEX GROUP NV ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018  

We present to you our statutory auditor’s report in the context of our statutory audit of the consolidated accounts of Ontex Group
NV (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (jointly “the Group”, “Ontex”). This report includes our report on the consolidated accounts,
as well as the other legal and regulatory requirements. This report forms part of an integrated whole and is indivisible.

We have been appointed as statutory auditor by the general meeting d.d. 24 May 2017, following the proposal formulated by the
board of directors and following the recommendation by the audit committee. Our mandate will expire on the date of the general
meeting which will deliberate on the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019. We have performed the statutory
audit of the consolidated accounts of Ontex Group NV for 5 consecutive years.

###### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

**Unqualified opinion**

We have performed the statutory audit of the Group’s consolidated accounts, which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2018, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information,
and which is characterised by a consolidated statement of financial position total of EUR 2,789.6 million and a profit for the year
of EUR 97.0 million.

In our opinion, the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the Group’s net equity and consolidated financial position as
at 31 December 2018, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable in Belgium.

**Basis for unqualified opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium. Furthermore, we
have applied the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as approved by the IAASB for the years ending as from 31 December
2018, which are not yet approved at the national level. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
“Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts” section of our report. We have fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium,
including the requirements related to independence.

We have obtained from the board of directors and Company officials the explanations and information necessary for performing
our audit.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**1. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex carries a significant value of goodwill on the balance sheet amounting to EUR 1,165.2 million as detailed in disclosure 7.9.
Under The International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS’s”), the Company is required to test the
amount of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets for impairment at least annually. We consider this matter to be of
most significance because of the complexity of the assessment process and significant judgments in respect of assumptions about
the future results of the business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. The most important assumptions
relate to the discount rate, growth rates of revenue and operating margin. We focused on the goodwill, intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment of the Cash Generating Unit (further CGU) Americas because the headroom between the value in
use of this CGU and its carrying value was significantly lower compared to the headroom in the other CGUs.


-----

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged if the goodwill impairment test was performed at the lowest CGU level at which the goodwill is monitored. We
challenged the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests and the process through which they were prepared. We found
that the projected cash flow for 2019 were consistent with the Board approved budgets, which were subject to timely oversight
and challenge by the Directors. We have critically assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and evaluation of
business plans by comparing the prior year’s forecast with the company’s actual performance. For the cash flows after 2019 we
critically assessed and checked the assumptions related to the long term growth rates, by comparing them to industry forecasts
and historical growth rates. We compared the weighted average cost of capital to the cost of capital and debt of the company and
comparable organisations, as well as considering territory specific factors. We tested the calculation method used and the
accuracy thereof. We compared operating margin, working capital- and CAPEX percentage with past actuals. We challenged the
adequacy of management’s sensitivity analysis of the headroom. For all CGUs we calculated the degree to which these
assumptions would need to move before an impairment conclusion was triggered. We discussed the likelihood of such a
movement with management. We included valuation specialists in our team to assist us with these procedures. We also assessed
the adequacy of the disclosures (Note 7.9 and Note 7.4.3) in the financial statements.

**Our results**
From our sensitivity analysis, we found the likelihood of changes resulting in impairment losses to be unlikely.

**2. Valuation of deferred taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to tax**
**losses carried forward**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Ontex has recognised a deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability of respectively EUR 26.5 million and EUR 49.9 million. EUR
86.7 million deferred tax asset position was not recognised, as disclosed in Note 7.18. Ontex recognised in 2018 EUR 8.5 million
deferred tax assets on previously unrecognised tax losses as disclosed in Note 7.26. The valuation of the deferred tax positions
at Ontex involved significant judgement, more specifically in the determination of the recognition of deferred tax assets related to
tax losses carried forward. The estimation of the future taxable basis is highly judgemental as well as the assessment of the
impact of tax laws and regulations, tax planning action and strategies, rulings and transfer pricing. Because of all the
aforementioned reasons, we found this key audit matter to be of most significance for our audit.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We challenged the assumptions made to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to tax losses carried forward and
the timing of the reversal of deferred tax positions. During our procedures, we used amongst others budgets, forecasts and tax
laws and in addition we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s assumptions. We involved tax specialists in our audit.
An important management judgement was the period over which taxable profits can be reliably estimated and consequently, no
deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses used in any period beyond. We verified that the deferred tax position was
calculated at the enacted tax rate for the year in which the deferred tax position is expected to reverse.

We also assessed the adequacy and completeness of the Company’s disclosure included in Note 7.4.1, 7.18 and 7.26 in respect
of deferred taxes.

**Our results**

We found management’s judgements in respect of the Group’s deferred tax positions to be consistent and in line with our
expectations.

**3. Accounting for accruals for sales incentives and purchase related incentives**

**Description of the key audit matter**

Trade discounts and volume rebates related to both sales and purchases are subject to judgmental estimates and assessments
of the impact of commercial negotiations which take place after year-end. The impact of commercial negotiations is material and
hence of most significance for our audit. Ontex calculates an estimate of final incentives based on the information available until
the financial statements are established. Incentives related to sales are reported as deduction of company’s revenue. Purchase
discounts are recorded as a deduction of the initial purchase.

**How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

We have agreed the discount percentages or lump sum payments to underlying customer and purchase agreements, we
recalculated the accrual and challenged the estimated impact of commercial negotiations taking into account the results. We also
performed back-testing on the accruals per 31 December 2017. We also reviewed credit notes and other adjustments to trade
receivables and trade payables after 31 December 2018 as part of our work around subsequent events. Finally we have audited
manual journal entries related to discounts in order to confirm that sufficient documentation and suitable attestations exist for
these entries.

**Our results**

Our work did not identify findings that are significant for the financial statements as a whole.


-----

**Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and fair view in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements
applicable in Belgium, and for such internal control as the board of directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the board of directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated accounts.

In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to the audit of the consolidated
accounts in Belgium.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout
the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the board of directors.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether
the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the board of directors and with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

We also provide the board of directors and the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the board of directors and with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.


-----

###### OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

**Responsibilities of the board of directors**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts.

**Statutory auditor’s responsibilities**

In the context of our mandate and in accordance with the Belgian standard (Revised in 2018) which is complementary to the
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Belgium, our responsibility is to verify, in all material respects, the
directors’ report on the consolidated accounts and to report on these matters.

**Aspects related to the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts**

In our opinion, after having performed specific procedures in relation to the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts, this
report is consistent with the consolidated accounts for the year under audit, and it is prepared in accordance with article 119 of
the Companies’ Code.

In the context of our audit of the consolidated accounts, we are also responsible for considering, in particular based on the
knowledge acquired resulting from the audit, whether the directors’ report on the consolidated accounts and the other information
included in the integrated annual report on the consolidated accounts is materially misstated or contains information which is
inadequately disclosed or otherwise misleading. In light of the procedures we have performed, there are no material misstatements
we have to report to you.

The non-financial information required by virtue of article 119, §2 of the Companies’ Code is included in the directors’ integrated
annual report on the consolidated accounts. The Company has prepared the non-financial information based on the Global
Reporting Initiative Standards and with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals. However, in accordance with article
148, §1, 5° of the Companies’ Code, we do not express an opinion as to whether the non-financial information has been prepared
in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Standards and with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals.

**Statement related to independence**

- Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the statutory audit of the
consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent of the Group in the course of our mandate.

- The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated accounts referred to in article
134 of the Companies’ Code are correctly disclosed and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.

**Other statements**

- This report is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the Regulation (EU)
N° 537/2014.

Ontex was founded in 1979 by Paul Van Malderen and initially produced mattress protectors for the Belgian institutional market.
During the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, the Company expanded its product range into its current core product categories
and grew the business internationally both organically and through acquisitions.

After opening a production facility in the Czech Republic and acquiring businesses in Belgium, Germany and Spain, Ontex was
listed on Euronext Brussels in 1998. Following the listing, Ontex experienced rapid growth over several years, primarily through
bolt-on acquisitions in France, Germany and Turkey.

Ontex was acquired by funds advised by Candover in 2003 and subsequently de-listed from Euronext Brussels. Ontex acquired
a diaper production unit of Paul Hartmann in Germany in 2004 and opened a production facility in China in 2006. In 2008, we
opened a production facility in Algeria. In 2010, Ontex acquired iD Medica, which sells incontinence products in Germany.

In 2010, Ontex was acquired by funds managed by GSCP and TPG. In 2011, Ontex opened two additional production facilities,
one in Australia and one in Russia, and acquired Lille Healthcare, a company operating in the adult incontinence market in France.
In 2013, Ontex acquired Serenity, a company operating in the adult incontinence market in Italy, and opened a production facility
in Pakistan.

In June 2014, Ontex Group NV successfully listed its shares on the Euronext Brussels exchange and trades under the ticker
‘ONTEX’.

In February 2016, Ontex acquired Grupo Mabe, a leading Mexican manufacturer of disposable personal hygiene products.

In March 2017, Ontex has completed the acquisition of the personal hygiene business of Hypermarcas (renamed to “Ontex
Brazil”).

In July 2017 Ontex opened its new production plant in Ethiopia for the manufacturing of baby diapers that are specifically meeting
the needs of African families.

In October 2018, Ontex opened a new production plant in Radomsko, Poland to support its Central European business.

###### 7. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 7.1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

**7.1.1. Introduction**

The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the period from January 1, 2018 to December
31, 2018 are consistent with those applied in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017
of Ontex Group NV, except for the introduction of the new requirements applied to revenue as a result of the application of IFRS
15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (see below). The accounting policies have
been consistently applied to all the periods presented.

**7.1.2. Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements of the Ontex Group NV for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been prepared in
compliance with IFRS (“International Financial Reporting Standards”) as adopted by the European Union. These include all IFRS
standards and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective as at December 31, 2018. The new standards, amendments to standards
and interpretations that are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning January 1, 2018, did not have a significant
impact. No new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations were early adopted.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial
instruments for which fair value is used (such as derivative instruments).

These financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and on the assumption that the entity is in going concern and will
continue in operation in the foreseeable future.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Group accounting policies. The areas involving a higher
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in note 7.4.

**IFRS accounting standards to be adopted as from 2018 and onwards**

The following relevant new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the first
time for the financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018:

IFRS 9 Financial instruments: IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and brings together
the following aspects of accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial assets and includes a new model for assessing the impairment
of the financial assets based on expected credit losses. Most of the basics of hedge accounting do not change as a result of IFRS
9. However, hedge accounting can be applied to a larger number of risk exposures than before and hedge accounting principles
have been harmonized with those used in risk management.

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and
establishes a comprehensive framework for determining when to recognize revenue and how much revenue to recognize for all
contracts with customers, except for revenue from leases, financial instruments and insurance contracts. The timing of the revenue
recognition can take place over time or at a point in time, depending on the transfer of control. The standard also introduces new
guidance on costs of fulfilling and obtaining a contract, specifying the circumstances in which such costs should be capitalized or
expensed when incurred. Furthermore, the new disclosures included in IFRS 15 are more detailed than those applicable under
IAS 18.

Improvements to IFRS (2014-2016): This set of amendments impacts: IFRS 1 First-time adoption of IFRS, regarding the deletion
of short-term exemptions for first-time adopters regarding IFRS 7, IAS 19, and IFRS 10; and IAS 28 Investments in Associates
_and Joint Ventures regarding measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value._

Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions: The amendment clarifies the
measurement basis for cash-settled payments and the accounting for modifications that change an award from cash settled to
equity settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly
equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee’s tax obligation associated with a sharebased payment and pay the amount to the tax authorities.

IFRIC 22 _Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration: This IFRIC addresses foreign currency transactions or_
parts of transactions where there is consideration that is denominated or priced in a foreign currency.

The above-mentioned standards did not have an impact on the financial statements, except for IFRS 15.

The impact of the changes in accounting policies due to the application of IFRS 15 on the consolidated income statement for the
year ended December 31, 2017 is presented below. As a result of the application of the revised accounting policies due to the
application of IFRS 15 on a full retrospective basis, reclassifications were done in the consolidated income statement for the year
ended December 31, 2017 relating to fees paid to customers and agents for distinct services from net sales to distribution
expenses and sales and marketing expenses for respectively € 12.2 million and € 8.2 million:

**Operating profit** **208.3** **-** **208.3**

**Relevant IFRS accounting pronouncements to be adopted as from 2019 onwards**

A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and annual improvement cycles have been published and are
mandatory for the first time for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 and have not been early adopted. Those
which may be the most relevant to the Ontex Group’s consolidated financial statements are set out below.

**IFRS 16 Leases**

IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. For lessees, IFRS 16 requires most leases to be recognized onbalance (under a single model), eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. In accordance with the new
standard, the lessee will recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases. The standard increases
interest-bearing liabilities and non-current assets (new class “Right-of-use assets”) in the consolidated financial statements of the
Ontex Group. In addition, the rental expenses recognized in profit or loss will decrease and depreciation and amortization as well
as interest expenses will increase. As a result of these impacts, EBITDA will be impacted significantly. However, operating result
and net result (profit of the period) will only be impacted to a limited extent.

IFRS 16 is effective for the reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019. The Ontex Group applies the new guidelines for
lease accounting retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized on January 1, 2019
(modified retrospective approach) in accordance with the transition requirements of IFRS 16. The comparative statements will not
be restated. Upon transition, the Group uses following practical expedients authorized by the standard:

 - Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;

 - Excluding initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application;

 - Using hindsight, such as in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease;

 - Not reassessing whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application, for contracts entered into before
January 1, 2019.

Furthermore, the Group will use the exemptions not to apply the recognition requirements of the standard for short-term leases
and low-value assets.

Upon transition, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The related right-of-use assets are measured at an amount
equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in
the statement of financial position per December 31, 2018.

At transition date, the right-of-use assets will mainly comprise offices, plants, machinery and vehicles. Based on the preliminary
analysis conducted at closing 2018, the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities amount to € 147.2 million.

If IFRS 16 had been applied as from January 1[st], 2018, the EBITDA would have been between € 28.0 and € 30.0 million higher.

**Other relevant standards and interpretations**

The following new relevant standards, amendments to standards and annual improvement cycles have been issued, but are not
mandatory for the first time for the financial periods beginning January 1, 2018 and are expected not to have a significant impact
on the Ontex’ consolidated financial statements:

Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business (effective January 1, 2020, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments aim to
assist companies to determine whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets.

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material (effective January 1, 2020, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments
clarify the definition of “material” and to align the definition used in the Conceptual Framework and the standards.

Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits (effective January 1, 2019, but not yet endorsed in EU): The amendments clarify that
if a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, it is now mandatory that the current service cost and the net interest for
the period after the remeasurement are determined using the assumptions used for the remeasurement.

Annual improvements 2015-2017 (effective January 1, 2019, but not yet endorsed in EU): The Improvements contain amendments
to four standards as a result of the IASB's annual improvements project. Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements clarify the definition of a business and the accounting for previously held interests. The amendment
to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ clarify that all income tax consequences of dividends (i.e. distribution of profits) should be recognized in
profit or loss, regardless of how the tax arises and finally, the amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs clarify the accounting for
specific borrowings which remain outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale.

IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (effective January 1, 2019): This Interpretation sets out how to determine the
accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Group has performed an assessment of its
uncertain tax positions and the application of IFRIC 23 is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the future consolidated
financial statements. The Group applies these new guidelines retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the
interpretation recognized on January 1, 2019 (modified retrospective approach) in accordance with the transition requirements of
IFRIC 23.

**7.1.3. Consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control is established when the Group is exposed, or has the rights,
to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity
interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration agreement. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at acquisition date. On an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.

The excess of the consideration of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is
recognized directly in the income statement.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.

**Transactions with non-controlling interests**

The Group treats the transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases
from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value
of the net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses on disposal to non-controlling interests are also recorded
in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value,
with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
subsequent accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income
are reclassified to profit or loss.


-----

**7.1.4. Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets
of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in “investments
in associates” and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance. Separately recognized goodwill is tested annually for
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and
losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

The goodwill recognized in the statement of financial position is allocated to five Cash Generating Units (CGUs). These CGUs
are Mature Market Retail, Growth Markets, Healthcare, Middle East North Africa (MENA) and Americas Retail. They represent
the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This is in line with the
centralized business model that was implemented during 2010.

**7.1.5. Foreign currencies**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro,
which is the Group’s presentation currency.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income
statement.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to interest-bearing debts and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
income statement within “Net Finance cost”. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement
within “Other operating income/(expenses), net”.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are
translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period. Items of income and expense are translated at the monthly average
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions), and equity
items are translated at historical rates. The resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

The principal exchange rates that have been used are as follows:

**Currency** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**

**Closing Rate** **Av Rate Year** **Closing Rate** **Av Rate Year**

AUD 1.6220 1.5798 1.5346 1.4729

BRL 4.4440 4.3089 3.9729 3.6085

CZK 25.7240 25.6440 25.5350 26.3277

GBP 0.8945 0.8847 0.8872 0.8761

MXN 22.4921 22.7141 23.6612 21.3261

PLN 4.3014 4.2605 4.1770 4.2562

RUB 79.7153 74.0385 69.3920 65.8859

TRY 6.0588 5.6968 4.5464 4.1214

USD 1.1450 1.1814 1.1993 1.1293


-----

**7.1.6. Intangible assets**

An intangible asset is recognized on the statement of financial position when the following conditions are met: (1) the asset is
identifiable, ie either separable (if it can be sold, transferred, licensed) or it results from contractual or legal rights; (2) it is probable
that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; (3) the Group can control the
resource; and (4) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets are carried at acquisition cost (including the costs directly attributable to the transaction) less any accumulated
amortizations and less any accumulated impairment losses.

Within the Group, internally generated intangibles represent IT projects and product/process development projects.

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique projects controlled by the group
are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

 - it is technically feasible to complete the project so that it will be available for use

 - management intends to complete the project and use or sell it

 - there is an ability to use or sell the project

 - it can be demonstrated how the project will generate probable future economic benefits

 - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the project are available,
and

 - the expenditure attributable to the project during its development can be reliably measured.

The Group’s systems allow a reliable measure of expenses directly attributable to the different IT and product/process
development projects.

Research expenditure and development expenditure that do not meet the criteria above are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Externally acquired software is carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated amortization and less any accumulated
impairment loss.

Maintenance costs as well as the costs of minor upgrades whose objective is to maintain (rather than increase) the level of
performance of the asset are expensed as incurred.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and or production of a qualifying intangible asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

Intangible assets are amortized on a systematic basis over their useful life, using the straight-line method. The applicable useful
lives are:


**Intangible assets**


Brands 20 years

IT implementation costs 5 years

Capitalized development costs 3 to 5 years

Licenses 3 to 5 years

Acquired concessions, patents, know-how, and other similar rights 5 years

Amortization commences only when the asset is available for use.

**7.1.7. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment loss. Acquisition cost includes any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended
use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and/or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalized as part of the cost of the asset.

Expenditure on repair and maintenance which serve only to maintain, but not increase, the value of fixed assets are charged to
the income statement. However, expenditure on major repair and major maintenance, which increases the future economic
benefits that will be generated by the fixed asset, is identified as a separate element of the acquisition cost. The cost of property,
plant and equipment is broken down into major components. These major components, which are replaced at regular intervals
and consequently have a useful life that is different from that of the fixed asset in which they are incorporated, are depreciated
over their specific useful lives. In the event of replacement, the component is replaced and removed from the statement of financial
position, and the new asset is depreciated up until the next major repair or maintenance.


-----

The depreciable amount is allocated on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset, using the straight-line method. The
depreciable amount is the acquisition cost, less residual value, if any. The applicable useful lives are:


**Property, plant and equipment**


Land N/A

Land improvements and buildings 30 years

Plants, machinery and equipment 10 to 15 years

Funriture and vehicles 4 to 8 years

Other tangible assets 5 years

IT equipment 3 to 5 years

The useful life of the machines is reviewed regularly. Each time a significant upgrade is performed, such upgrade extends the
useful life of the machine. The cost of the upgrade is added to the carrying amount of the machine and the new carrying amount
is depreciated prospectively over the remaining estimated useful life of the machine.

**7.1.8. Leases**

**Finance leases**

The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment for which the Group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease’s
commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each
lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the remaining balance
of the liability. Finance expenses are recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying
assets, in which case they are capitalized. Contingent rentals are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

If there is reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset shall be depreciated
over the useful life. In all other circumstances the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease
term.

**Operating leases**

A lease agreement is classified as an operating lease if all of the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the
lessee. Payments under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

**7.1.9. Impairment of non-financial assets, other than goodwill**

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization, but are
tested annually for impairment.

Other assets which are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value
in use.

When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A
reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises the production costs, like raw materials, direct labor, and also the
indirect production costs (production overheads based on normal operating capacity). Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.

Spare parts held by the Group are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are expected to be used in more than one
period and if they are specific to a single machine. If they are not expected to be used in more than one period or if they can be
used on several machines, they are classified as inventory. For the spare parts classified as inventory, the Group uses write-down
rules based on the economic use of these spare parts.


-----

**7.1.11. Revenue recognition**

Ontex Group’s core activity is the sale of goods. As such, the Group recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of the
goods is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. The Group sells its products to its customers directly,
through distributors or agents. This can result in a different moment to recognize revenue. Following delivery to distributors, the
distributor has full discretion over the manner of distribution and price to sell the goods, has the primary responsibility when selling
the goods and bears the risks of obsolescence and loss in relation to the goods.

Next to the sale of goods, distinct services – mainly customer training or customer assistance services – are rendered
predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer. Transportation (shipping) is not be
considered as a separate performance obligation as control over the goods is only transferred to the customer after the shipment.

Payment terms can differ depending on the customer, based on the credit risk and prior payment behavior of the customer. In
addition, the geographical location of the company and the customer have an effect on the payment terms. There are no significant
financing components in the transaction prices and the considerations are paid in cash.

Customer contracts include trade discounts or volume rebates, which are granted to the customer if the delivered quantities
exceed a certain threshold. In these cases, the transaction price includes a variable consideration. The effect of the variable
consideration on the transaction price is taken into account in revenue recognition by estimating the probability of the realization
of the discount or rebate for each contract. Furthermore, the estimated variable consideration is included in the transaction price
only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved (constraining the variable consideration).
Furthermore, the Group considers all payments made to customers and whether these are related to the revenue generated from
the customer.

A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because
only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

**7.1.12. Financial assets**

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value and financial assets at amortized
cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the
cash flows. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell an asset.

At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of
financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets (such as loans, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents) are subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment if they are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all
fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on
initial recognition.

Trade and other receivables after and within one year are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized
cost, i.e. at the net present value of the receivable amount, using the effective interest rate method, less allowances for impairment.

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized
cost. For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which requires
expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables.

The amount of the allowance is deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the income statement within
‘sales and marketing expenses’.

Trade receivables are no longer recognized when (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the trade receivables have expired, (2)
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards related to the receivables.

The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset,
the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the
financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity is recognized in profit or loss.


-----

On de-recognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (eg when the Group retains an option to repurchase part of a
transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to
recognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts
on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the
sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognized and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been
recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in
other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is no longer
recognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

**7.1.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of
financial position.

**7.1.14. Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Where any Group company purchases the company’s equity share capital (treasury
shares), the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the company until the shares are cancelled or
reissued. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.

Financial instruments, such as the Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs), are either classified as financial liabilities
or equity. The financial instrument is included in equity if, and only if, the instrument does not include a contractual obligation to
deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or liabilities under conditions that are potentially unfavorable
to the Group, and if the instrument will or may be settled in a fixed number of the Group’s own equity instruments.

**7.1.15. Government grants**

Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.

Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the assets to which they
relate and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

**7.1.16. Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are recorded as an expense in the income statement in the period in which the services have been
rendered. Any unpaid compensation is included in ‘Employee benefit liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.

**Post-employment benefits**

Group companies operate various pension schemes. Most of the schemes are unfunded. Some schemes are funded through
payments to insurance companies or pension funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined
benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit
plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit
that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation.

The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. The net interest cost relating to the defined benefit plans is recognized
within financial expenses.

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.


-----

**Long-term employee benefits**

Unfunded obligations arising from long-term benefits are provided for using the projected unit credit method.

**Termination benefits**

Early termination obligations are recognized as a liability when the Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ to terminating the
employment before the normal retirement date. The Group is ‘demonstrably committed’ when, and only when, it has a detailed
formal plan for the early termination without realistic possibility of withdrawal. Where such benefits are long term, they are
discounted using the same rate as above for defined benefit obligations.

**7.1.17. Share-based payments**

The Group operates an equity settled share-based compensation plan, consisting of stock options (hereafter ‘options’) and
restricted stock units (‘RSU’). For grants of options and RSU’s, the fair value of the employee services received is measured by
reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted on the date of the grant. The Group recognizes the fair value of the
services received in exchange for the grant of the options as an expense and a corresponding increase in equity on a straightline basis over the vesting period. The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into
account the exercise price of the option, the share price at date of grant of the option, the risk-free interest rate, the expected
volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Vesting conditions included in the terms of the
grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value except where those terms relate to market conditions. Non-market vesting
conditions are considered by adjusting the number of shares or options included in the measurement of the cost of employee
services so that ultimately the amount recognized in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or options.

At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and
recognizes the impact of revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity
over the remaining vesting period.

When the options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share
capital (nominal value) and share premium.

The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the options is considered an integral part of the grant
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.

**7.1.18. Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when (I) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (II) it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; (III) and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
considering the class of obligations as a whole.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in
the provision due to passage of time is recognized as finance cost.

If the Group has an onerous contract, it will be recognized as a provision. Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination
penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.

A provision for restructuring is only recorded if the Group demonstrates a constructive obligation to restructure at the balance
sheet date. The constructive obligation should be demonstrated by: (a) a detailed formal plan identifying the main features of the
restructuring; and (b) raising a valid expectation to those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement
the plan or by announcing its main features to those affected.


-----

**7.1.19. Income taxes**

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the
reporting period in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. In line with paragraph 46
of IAS 12 Income taxes, management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts
expected to be paid to the tax authorities. This evaluation is made for tax periods open for audit by the competent authorities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.

Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements.

However, the deferred tax is not recognized for:

 - the initial recognition of goodwill;

 - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and

 - deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred
income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for taxable temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for tax losses and tax attributes to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred taxes are calculated at the level of each fiscal entity in the Group. The Group is able to offset deferred tax assets and
liabilities only if the deferred tax balances relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.

**7.1.20. Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are classified as at amortized cost, except for derivative
instruments (see 7.1.21 below).

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting
period.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including
all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums
or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount
on initial recognition.

When a financial liability measured at amortized cost is modified without this resulting in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognized
in profit or loss. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash
flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.

A limited part of trade payable is subject to reverse factoring. As the main risk and rewards of the trade payable remain with the
Group, the financial liability is not de-recognized from trade payables.


-----

**7.1.21. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate
and commodity price risks and equity price risks associated with share-based payments, including foreign exchange forward
contracts, commodity hedging contracts and interest rate CAP’s and SWAP’s and a total return swap.

Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting
gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument,
in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.

The fair values of various derivative instruments are disclosed in note 7.4 Financial Instruments and Financial Risk Management.
The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is
more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

If no hedge accounting is applied, the Group recognizes all gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives in
the consolidated income statement within Other operating income/expense to the extent that they relate to operating activities
and within Net finance cost to the extent that they relate to the financing activities of the Group (e.g. interest rate swaps relating
to the floating rate borrowings).

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

**7.1.22. Hedge accounting**

The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk and commodities,
as cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized
in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss and is included in the ‘other operating income/(expense)' line item.

Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the
periods when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss, in the same line of the consolidated income statement as the
recognized hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a
non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction
is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated
in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**7.1.23. Operating segments**

The Group’s activities are in one segment. There are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate.
The chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors, reviews the operating results (defined as EBITDA) and operating
plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis; therefore, the Group operates as one segment.

**7.1.24. Statement of cash flows**

The cash flows of the Group are presented using the indirect method. This method reconciles the movement in cash for the
reporting period by adjusting net profit of the year for any non-cash items and changes in working capital, and identifying investing
and financing cash flows for the reporting period.

###### 7.2. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Alternative performance measures (non-GAAP) are used in the financial communication of the Group since management believes
that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measure of
performance and liquidity. The alternative performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
operating results, our performance or our liquidity under IFRS.

**7.2.1. Non-recurring income and expenses**

Items classified under the heading non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are considered by management not
to relate to items in the ordinary course of activities of the Company. They are presented separately as they are important for the
understanding of users of the consolidated financial statements of the “normal” performance of the Company due to their size or
nature. The non-recurring income and expenses relate to:

 - acquisition-related expenses;

 - changes to the measurement of contingent considerations in the context of business combinations;

 - business restructuring costs, including costs relate to the liquidation of subsidiaries and the closure, opening or relocations of
factories and

 - impairment of assets.

Non-recurring income and expenses of the Group for the years ended December 31 are composed of the following items
presented in the consolidated income statement and can be reconciled in note 7.23:

 - income/(expenses) related to changes to Group structure; and

 - income/(expenses) related to impairments and major litigations.

**7.2.2. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance cost, income taxes, depreciations and amortizations. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**In € million** **Full Year**

**2018** **2017**

**Operating Profit** **152.8** **208.3**

Depreciation and amortization 56.9 53.7

**EBITDA** **209.7** **262.0**

Non-recurring income and expenses 24.3 4.4

**Adjusted EBITDA** **234.0** **266.4**

**7.2.3. Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio (Leverage)**

Net financial debt is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and deducting cash and cash equivalents.

LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus non-recurring income and expenses for the last twelve months (LTM).

Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of the Group for the years ended December 31 are presented in note 7.4 ‘Capital
Management’.

###### 7.3. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide benefits for shareholders.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt position. The Group’s net debt position is calculated by adding all short
and long-term interest-bearing debts and by deducting the available short-term liquidity.

The net debt positions of the Group for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**
Non-current interest-bearing debts 786.6 772.0

Current interest-bearing debts 104.0 69.9

Other current financial liabilities  - 20.8

Cash and cash equivalents (130.6) (118.5)

**Total net debt position** **760.0** **744.2**

LTM Adjusted EBITDA 234.0 266.4

**Net financial debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio** **3.25** **2.79**

###### 7.4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements involve the use of estimates and assumptions about the future.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual amounts may differ from
these estimates. The estimates and assumptions that could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements are discussed
below.

**7.4.1. Income taxes**

The Group has tax losses and other tax incentives usable to offset future taxable profits, mainly in Belgium, Brazil, France and
Spain, amounting to € 378.4 million at December 31, 2018 (€ 401.9 million at December 31, 2017).

As mentioned in the 2017 consolidated financial statements, the European Commission challenged Belgium’s excess profit ruling
(EPR) system, characterizing this system as illegal state aid. Ontex, through its Belgian subsidiary Ontex BVBA, had an EPR
covering the years 2011-2015. Ontex has lodged an appeal against this EC decision. The General Court has handed down its
judgment on February 14, 2019 in the joint case of Belgium vs Commission and Magnetrol International vs Commission. The
General Court has annulled the Commission’s Decision for the reason that the Commission erroneously considered that the
excess profit exemption system constituted an aid scheme. Further to the General Court’s decision, the excess profit regime is at
this moment considered valid, the Belgian government was allowed to grant the different EPRs and Ontex BVBA was entitled to
apply the ruling it was granted in the years 2011-2015. An appeal may be brought by the European Commission before the Court
of Justice against the decision of the General Court within two months of notification of the judgment.

Ontex had fully taken into account the impact of the Commission’s Decision in its tax position. Since the outcome is not yet final,
Ontex will await the decision of the European Commission whether or not to appeal the General’s Court judgment and will not
release the relevant provisions at this stage. In case of appeal, it is expected that it will take some time before the European Court
of Justice would make a decision on the appeal and the final outcome will not be known until that moment.

The Group has only recognized deferred tax assets on € 76.5 million of tax losses and other tax incentives out of the € 378.4
million mentioned above. The measurement of these deferred tax assets depends on a number of judgmental assumptions
regarding the future probable taxable profits of different Group subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. These estimates are made
prudently to the extent of the best current knowledge.

**7.4.2. Business combinations**

For business combinations, the Group must make assumptions and estimates to determine the purchase price allocation of the
business being acquired. To do so, the Group must determine the acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and estimates have an impact on the asset and liability amounts recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position on the acquisition date. In addition, the estimated useful lives of the acquired
property, plant and equipment, the identification of other intangible assets and the determination of the indefinite or finite useful
lives of other intangible assets acquired requires significant judgments and will have an impact on the Group’s profit or loss.


-----

**7.4.3. Impairment**

The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note
7.1.4 “Goodwill”. The outcome of these goodwill impairment tests in 2018 did not result in an impairment loss (2017: nil).

The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimatesand assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, demand and competition in the
markets where we operate, product offerings, product mix and pricing, raw materials availability and cost, direct and indirect
expenses, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditure and working capital, etc. as reflected in Ontex’ financial budgets
and strategic plans, as well as discount rates. For more details on the impairment test performed, we refer to note 7.9 ‘Goodwill
and intangible assets’. The discount rates used are summarised here below:

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2018** **2017**

Pre-tax discount rate

Mature Market Retail 7.1% 6.6%

Growth Markets 12.7% 11.2%

Healthcare 6.7% 6.0%

Middle East North Africa 11.7% 13.8%

Americas Retail 9.5% 10.5%

A sensitivity analysis indicates that the recoverable amount of Mature Market Retail, Growth Markets, Healthcare, Middle East
North Africa and Americas Retail would be equal to their carrying amount if the pre-tax discount rates of the CGUs were 12.7%,
23.2%, 19.1%, 18.4% and 10.7%, respectively and all other variables kept constant.

As indicated in note 7.9, cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 1.0% for
Mature Market Retail, 2.0% for Growth Markets, 2.0% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MENA and 3.6% for Americas Retail. These same
percentages are used as perpetual growth rates. The growth rates have been determined by management but do not exceed the
current market expectations in which the five CGUs are currently operating. Should the growth rate for any of the CGUs decrease
by 40%, no impairment would need to be recognized.

Should the estimated operating margins decrease by 10%, no impairment would be recognized.

Future cash flows are estimates that are likely to be revised in future periods as underlying assumptions change. Key assumptions
in supporting the value of goodwill include long-term interest rates and other market data. Should the assumptions vary adversely
in the future, the value in use of goodwill may reduce below their carrying amounts. Based on current valuations, headroom
appears to be sufficient to absorb a normal variation in the underlying assumptions.

**7.4.4. Expected useful lives**

The expected useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets must be estimated. The determination of the
useful lives of the assets is based on management’s judgment and it is reviewed at least at each financial year-end, pursuant to
IAS 16 and IAS 38.

**7.4.5. Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments**

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is
determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions
that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. All derivative financial instruments are, in
accordance with IFRS 7, level 2. This means valuation methods are used for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the
recorded fair value are observable in the market, either directly or indirectly.

**7.4.6. Employee benefits**

The carrying amount of the Group’s employee benefit obligations is determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions.
One particularly sensitive assumption used for determining the net cost of the benefits granted is the discount rate. Any change
to this assumption will affect the carrying amount of those obligations.

The discount rate depends on the duration of the benefit, ie the average duration of the engagements, weighted with the present
value of the costs linked to those engagements. According to IAS 19, the discount rate should correspond to the rate of highquality corporate bonds of similar term to the benefits valued and in the same currency.

**7.4.7. Revenue recognition**

For the accrual for volume discounts (to customers and from suppliers) important judgements are made on the impact of
commercial decisions that will influence the final discount to be received or to be granted

-----

The derivative instruments presented in the tables above are all designated in a cash flow hedge relationship (see below in notes
7.5.3 to 7.5.5).

The fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is exceeding
12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.

The fair value of the derivatives is based on level 2 inputs as defined under IFRS 7§27, meaning inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The above table provides an analysis of financial instruments grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair
value (recognized on the statement of financial position or disclosed in the notes) is observable:

 - Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

 - Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).

 - Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are based on mathematical models that use market observable data and
are determined as follows:

 - The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid
markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices (includes listed redeemable notes).

 - The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted
cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives,
and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward
exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps
are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived
from quoted interest rates.

 - The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding those described above) are determined in
accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.

 - Level 3 liabilities: the amount has been determined based on contractual agreements.

The Group has derivative financial instruments which are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and
similar agreements. No offsetting needed to be done per December 31, 2018 (nor 2017).

The counterparties of the outstanding derivative instruments have an A-credit rating.

**7.5.2. Financial risk factors**

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity
price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

There have been no changes in the risk management department since last year-end or in any risk management policies.

**7.5.3. Foreign exchange risk**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily
with respect to the British pound (GBP), the Turkish lira (TRY), the Polish zloty (PLN), the Australian dollar (AUD), the Mexican
peso (MXN), the Brazilian real (BRL) and Russian ruble (RUB) in relation to sales, and the US dollar (USD), the Czech koruna
(CZK), the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Brazilian real (BRL) in relation to procurement. Foreign exchange risk arises from future
commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. The Group also has exposures to the Turkish lira (TRY), Algerian
dinar (DZD), Russian ruble (RUB), Czech koruna (CZK), Australian dollar (AUD) Pakistani rupee (PKR), Mexican peso (MXN)
and Brazilian real (BRL) due to their net investments in foreign operations.

The carrying amounts of the Group's main foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of
the reporting period are as follows:

**in € million** **Assets** **Liabilities**
**December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**

The Group monitors its foreign exchange exposure closely and will enter into hedging transactions if deemed appropriate to
minimize exposure throughout the Group to foreign exchange fluctuations. All hedging decisions are subject to approval of the
Board of Directors. The strategy regarding FX hedges was maintained.

To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, the Group
uses forward exchange contracts. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions, recognized assets and
liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The Group treasury is responsible for optimizing
the net position in each foreign currency when possible and appropriate. The Group applies hedge accounting for the hedgerelated
transactions, the impact of the revaluation is recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Group has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts at the beginning of each quarter in 2018 maturing at the latest in
September 2019 in order to limit volatility in the business resulting from exposures to sales in British pound, Polish zloty, Australian
dollar as well as purchases in US dollar and Czech crown during 2018 and 2019. Based on the hedge strategy, the foreign
exchange forward contracts hedge the following forecasted exposures until September 30, 2019: for British pound (GBP) 32.5
million, for Polish zloty (PLN) 75.8 million, for Australian dollar (AUD) 22.1 million, for Czech crown (CZK) 176.0 million, for US
dollar (USD) 56.2 million versus EUR, US dollar (USD) 14.0 million versus Mexican peso (MXN) and US dollar (USD) 1.4 million
versus Brazilian real (BRL).

The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the highly probable forecast
transactions. The Group applies hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts. At inception, these instruments were
designated as cash flow hedges. At the moment the forecast transactions materialise, the foreign exchange forward contracts
become fair value hedges. As the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the expected highly probable
forecast transactions, there is no hedge ineffectiveness to be recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

As of December 31, 2018, an unrealized gain of € 1.6 million (US dollar, Britisch pound,) and an unrealized loss of € 0.4 million
(Australian dollar, Czech koruna) have been recognized in other comprehensive income

As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the derivative financial asset for the foreign exchange contracts amounted to € 2.1
million (2017: € 1.6 million) and of the derivative financial liability amounted to € 0.4 million (2017: € 3.0 million).

The following table sets forth the impact on pre-tax profit and equity for the year of a 10% weakening/strengthening of the Euro
against the reported currency with all other variables held constant. The impact is mainly as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of foreign currency denominated trade receivables and payables and related derivative positions as at
the respective balance sheet dates.

**7.5.4. Interest rate risk**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash
flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rate expose the Group to
fair value interest rate risk. These risks are managed centrally by Group treasury taking into account the expectations of the Group
with respect to the evolutions of the market rates. The Group has used interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps
to manage these risks.

Considering that the floating rate borrowings (EURIBOR + margin) are hedged through interest rate swaps, the interest expense
recognized in the consolidated income statement is not subject to interest rate volatility and therefore no sensitivity analysis has
been prepared.

_Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to loans: at December 31, 2018, if EURIBOR interest rates_
had been 10bps higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have
been respectively € 1.1 million higher / € 1.0 million lower. At December 31, 2017, if EURIBOR interest rates had been 10bps
higher/lower with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively
€ 1.7 million higher / € 1.6 million lower.

Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.50%.
Floating Rate Syndicated Term Loan B of € 82.4 million due 2022 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.30%.
Floating Rate Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024 is carrying an interest of EURIBOR 3 month + margin of 1.40%. The notional
principal amounts of the outstanding fixed payer interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts at December
31, 2018 are € 787.4 million as per below table:

**Duration** **Fixed interest rate %** **Amount in € million**
1 Year 0.6650% 100.0

1 Year 0.1390% 50.0

6 Year 0.5950% 150.0

**Total** **787.4**

**7.5.5. Price risk (commodity)**
The Group has some exposure to the price of oil because certain of the raw materials used in production are manufactured from
oil derivatives. These include glues, polyethylene, propylene and polypropylene.

In relation to our fluff and propylene exposure, the Group has arrangements with certain of their fluff suppliers that reduce our
exposure to volatility in fluff prices. The Group also decided to hedge a portion of the propylene exposure that is not covered by
such arrangements for 2018.

Sensitivity of the fair value of derivative financial instruments related to commodities: at December 31, 2018 if there would be a
shift of the commodity forward curve by 10% increase/decrease with all other variables held constant, pre-tax other
comprehensive income for the year would have been respectively € 0.3 million higher / € 0.3 million lower (2017: impact was
less than € 0.1 million).

**7.5.6. Equity price risk**

Following the issuance of options and RSU’s as share-based payment arrangements under the different LTIP programmes (refer
to note 7.27 for details of these programs), the Group is exposed to variations in the Group share price. The Board of Directors of
the Group has decided on June 1, 2015 to implement a full hedging program through a total return swap. The purpose of this
financial instrument is to effectively hedge the risk that a price increase of the Ontex shares would negatively impact future cash
flows related to the share-based payments.

The Group entered into a total return swap (‘TRS’) agreement with a financial institution to manage its exposure to price volatility
related to the shares subject to the stock option and RSU plans as disclosed in note 7.27. Under the total return swap agreement,
the Company will pay interest to the financial institution. At the settlement of the TRS, the Group will receive the underlying shares
which will be granted to the beneficiaries of the stock options or RSU’s upon exercise. As such, the Group hedges the risk that
the share price would increase when shares have to be issued upon exercise by the beneficiaries of their options/RSUs. The
shares bought in this context are recognized in deduction of Group equity at the strike price at the moment of entering into the
TRS. As the Group takes physical delivery of the shares upon settlement of the TRS (no net settlement), the TRS does not meet


-----

the scope of financial instruments in accordance with IAS 32 / IFRS 9. As such, the TRS should not be remeasured at fair value
at each closing date.

As a result, the Group recognized treasury shares for an amount of € 42.1 million (represented by 1,559,874 shares) and a related
financial liability for an amount of € 33.0 million (see note 7.15). These amounts do not require to be remeasured during the
contract time and consequently, all volatility has been eliminated.

**7.5.7. Credit risk**

Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to corporate customers, including outstanding
receivables and committed transactions. The Group assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial
position, past experience and other factors based on which individual risk limits are set in accordance with the limits set by
business managers. Historical default rates have been below 1% for 2018 and 2017. Trade receivables are spread over different
countries and counterparties and there is no large concentration with one or a few counterparties.

We refer to note 7.12 for the aging of the receivables and the doubtful receivables.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount as presented in the table above in the note
7.5.1.

**7.5.8. Liquidity risk**

Group treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 7.16 Interest-bearing debts) at
all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on its borrowing facilities.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities (including interest payments) into relevant maturity groupings based on
the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

**in € million** **Less than** **Between 1** **Between 2** **Over 5 years**

###### 7.6. OPERATING SEGMENTS

According to IFRS 8, reportable operating segments are identified based on the “management approach”. This approach stipulates
external segment reporting based on the Group’s internal organizational and management structure and on internal financial
reporting to the chief operating decision maker. The Group’s activities are in one segment, “Hygienic Disposable Products”. There
are no other significant classes of business, either singularly or in aggregate. The chief operating decision maker, the Board of
Directors, reviews the operating results and operating plans, and make resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis.
Therefore, the Group operates as one segment. Enterprise-wide disclosures about product sales, geographic areas and revenue

from major customers are presented below[2]:

**7.6.1.** **Information by Division**

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2018** **2017**

Mature Market Retail 880.2 900.7

Americas Retail 618.0 624.1

**Total revenue** **2,292.2** **2,335.0**

**7.6.2. Information by product group**

The key product categories are:

 - Babycare products, principally baby diapers, baby pants and, to a lesser extent, wet wipes;

 - Feminine care products, such as sanitary towels, panty liners and tampons;

 - Adult incontinence products, such as adult pants, adult diapers, incontinence towels and bed protection.

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2018** **2017**

Babycare 1,345.1 1,410.5

Femcare 222.8 221.2

Adult Incontinence 693.6 689.5

Other 30.6 13.8

**Total revenue** **2,292.2** **2,335.0**

**7.6.3. Information by geographic area**

The organizational structure of the Group and its system of internal information indicates that the main source of geographical
risks results from the location of its customers (destination of its sales) and not the physical location of its assets (origin of its
sales). The location of Group’s customers is accordingly the geographical segmentation criterion and is defined as below:

 - Western Europe

 - Eastern Europe

 - Americas

 - Rest of the World

**in € million** **Full Year**

**2018** **2017**

Western Europe 1,075.2 1,073.9

Eastern Europe 292.9 314.4

Americas 620.2 628.1

ROW 303.8 318.6

**Total revenue** **2,292.2** **2,335.0**

2 Note that following implementation of IFRS 15 as from January 2018, prior year revenue figures have been re-stated to ensure comparability.
There is no impact on operating profit and EBITDA.

###### 7.8. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 

**7.8.1. 2017 Acquisition**

On March 7, 2017, Ontex completed the acquisition of the personal hygiene business of Hypermarcas (renamed to Ontex Brazil).
At year-end 2017, purchase price allocation and hence the determination of the goodwill was still provisional and was finalized in
2018.

Consequently, the Group adjusted the goodwill from € 124.7 million to € 128.3 million in the statement of financial position.

The goodwill of € 128.3 million arising from the acquisition is attributable to acquired workforce, scale and geographical spread of
the operations.

The following table summarizes the changes to the goodwill:


**in € million** **As recognized per**
**December 31, 2017**

**Recognized amounts of identifiable assets**
**acquired and liabilities assumed**


**Adjustments** **As recognized per**
**December 31, 2018**


Cash and cash equivalents 56.8 56.8

Intangible assets 24.3 24.3

Property, plant and equipment 82.9 (2.0) 80.9

Non-current receivables 0.6 0.6

**Goodwill impairment**

For the purpose of performing impairment reviews, the Group has identified five cash generating units (CGUs): Mature Market
Retail, Growth Markets, Healthcare, Middle East North Africa and Americas Retail. Annual impairment reviews are performed as
at December 31 for all CGUs. These reviews compare the carrying value of each CGU with the recoverable amount of the CGU’s
assets calculated using a discounted cash flow model. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an
impairment loss is recognized immediately in the income statement.

Goodwill allocated to the CGUs as at December 31 was as follows:

**in € million** **2018** **2017**

Mature Market Retail 732.5 732.5

Growth Markets 25.2 25.2

Healthcare 60.4 60.4

Middle East North Africa 42.0 42.0

Americas Retail 305.1 303.5

**Goodwill allocated to the CGU's** **1,165.2** **1,163.6**

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by means of value-in-use calculations. These calculations are based on pre-tax
cash flow projections (prepared in euros) using key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by Ontex’ Board
of Directors and the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2021. Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using an
estimated growth rate of 1.0% for Mature Market Retail, 2.0% for Growth Markets, 2.0% for Healthcare, 3.0% for MENA and 3.6%
for Americas Retail. The growth rate does not exceed the current market expectations in which the five CGUs are currently
operating.

The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations used to determine the recoverable amount are those regarding the discount
rates, estimated changes to selling prices, product offerings, direct costs, operating margins and terminal growth rates.

The discount rate is a measure based on industry average weighted cost of capital and risk-free rates weighted for the different
regions in which the CGU’s are operating.

Changes in selling practices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. The
calculation uses cash flow projections based on key parameters from the consolidated financial budget approved by the Board of
Directors, the Group’s Strategic Plan through 2021, and pre-tax discount rates for each CGU as described in note 7.4.3 Impairment
based on current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Group.

The development of the financial budget and Strategic Plan relies on a number of assumptions, including:

 - The market growth, the evolution of the Group’s market share, competitive landscape and innovation trends in the different
markets as well as strategic initiatives.

 - The product mix.

 - The expected evolution of various direct and indirect expenses.

 - The estimated future capital expenditure.

The assumptions were derived mainly from:

 - Available historic data.

 - External market research.

 - Internal market expectations based on trend reports, etc.

The key assumptions used are reviewed and updated on a yearly basis by the Group’s management. Taking into account the
considerable excess of the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount over its carrying amount, and based on sensitivity testing
performed, management is of the opinion that any reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on which the recoverable
amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount at December 31, 2018.

The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis by reducing the risk-adjusted cash flow projections and by increasing the pre-tax
discount rate as disclosed in note 7.4.3 Impairment.

The Group has entered into a Group non-recourse syndicate factoring agreement with BNP Paribas Fortis Factor and KBC
Commercial Finance. The Agreement provides us with a maximum credit facility of up to € 200 million and up to 95% of the amount
of the approved outstanding receivables on all debtors that we transfer to the Factor. The remaining 5% of the relevant receivables
is paid by the Factor to us upon receipt of payment from the relevant debtor, upon which also the remaining balance of the
receivable is derecognized. Financing per debtor is capped at 10% of the aggregate amount of all approved outstanding
receivables transferred to the Factor. Any financing within the credit limit is non-recourse to us. This factoring agreement is an offbalance sheet arrangement.

Next to the above-mentioned Group factoring agreement, Serenity (Italian subsidiary) entered into a bilateral factoring agreement
with Ifitalia and Banca Sistema. Furthermore, also Ontex Russia has entered into a bilateral factoring agreement with Rosbank.
All these agreements are non-recourse agreements.

As at December 31, 2018, € 163.2 million of financing was obtained through the factoring programs (€ 175.0 million in 2017). The
late payment risk related to the factoring has been assessed as immaterial at closing 2018 and 2017.

In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments, all non-recourse trade receivables, included in these factoring programs, are
derecognized for the non-continuing involvement part.

In March 2017, a capital increase was realized in an accelerated bookbuilt placement. The share capital increased with € 74.9
million, and the share premium increased with €146.0 million pursuant to a capital increase in cash.

The capital of € 1,208.0 million is represented by 82,347,218 shares, of which 1,559,874 treasury shares (2017: 1,068,684 treasury
shares). As such, the ordinary shares held by third parties amount to 80,787,344 shares (2017: 81,287,534).

###### 7.15. EARNINGS PER SHARE

In accordance with IAS 33, the basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to
ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The number
of shares used for 2017 was 79,661,317, which is the weighted average number of shares for 2017, given the capital increase in
March 2017, see also note 7.14. The number of shares used for 2018 was 81,020,929, which is the weighted average number of
shares for 2018.

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent
(after adjusting for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

In case of Ontex Group NV, no effects of dilution affect the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders. The table below reflects
the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

All borrowings are denominated in € as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. On November 14, 2014, Ontex Group NV closed the
offering of € 250.0 million 4.75% Senior Secured Notes due November 15, 2021 for an issue price of 100%. On November 15,
2017, the Group redeemed all outstanding Notes. As a result of this early redemption, the Group incurred a redemption expense
of € 5.9 million, which is presented in ‘Net finance cost’ in the 2017 consolidated income statement.

On September 26, 2017, the Group entered into a syndicate credit facilities agreement (Syndicated Term Loan A) in an amount
of € 600.0 million, and a revolving credit facility (Senior Revolving Facility B) in an amount of up to € 300.0 million. The Syndicated
Term Loan A of € 600 million due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.50%. The Senior Revolving
Facility B of € 82.4 million due 2022 is carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months + margin of 1.30%.

Furthermore, the Group has also closed a Term Loan of € 150 million due 2024, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR 3 months
+ margin of 1.40%. This agreement also includes an accordion option of € 100 million, carrying an interest rate of EURIBOR
3 months + margin of 1.40%.

As of December 31, 2018, € 217.6 million of the Senior Revolving Facility is undrawn (2017: € 270.0 million).

On July 29, 2015, a full hedging program (total return swap) for the share-based payment arrangements (LTIP) was implemented.
For more information we refer to note 7.5.6 and 7.27.

This program was extended and the total return swap increased to an amount of € 33.0 million (2017: € 25.6 million).

**7.16.1. Collateral for borrowings**

The Group is subject to regular information covenants, and certain financial ratios are monitored.

No assets have been pledged in the context of the syndicated term loans. However, certain subsidiaries act as guarantors for
these loans.

###### 7.17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES 

The Group grants its working and retired personnel post-employment benefits, long-term benefits, and termination benefits. These
benefits have been valued in conformity with IAS 19. The related IAS 19 liability recognized in the statement of financial position
can be analysed as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**
Post-employment benefits 19.9 19.3

Long-term benefits 2.6 2.3

Termination benefits[1] 0.1 0.1

**Employee benefit liabilities** **22.6** **21.7**

Short-term employee benefit liabilities 47.9 44.7

**Net liability** **70.4** **66.4**

1The termination benefits include also the pre-pensions.

The calculation of the liability is based on actuarial assumptions that have been determined on the various balance sheet dates.
They are based not only on macro-economic factors valid for the dates in question but also on the specific characteristics of the
various schemes evaluated. They represent the Group’s best estimate for the future. They are periodically reviewed in accordance
with the evolution of the markets and available statistics.

**Post-employment benefits**

Ontex makes payments on a defined contribution basis to both state and private pension arrangements across our operations. In
addition, Ontex operates a defined benefit insurance scheme in Belgium and Ontex also has an obligation to make severance
payments to employees upon their retirement in France and Turkey.

Ontex also operates several unfunded pension arrangements in respect of our German operations. The German operations do
not fund the pension arrangements but reflect pension scheme liabilities in company accounts on an IAS 19 basis. The pension
benefits are paid by the relevant company as they fall due.

The Group operates a couple of defined contribution (DC) plans which receive fixed contributions. The Group’s legal or
constructive obligation for these plans is limited to the contributions. The expense recognized in the current period in relation to
these contributions amounts to € 3.6 million (see also note 7.21 below; 2017: € 4.1 million).

In Belgium, the defined contribution (DC) plans are subject to a minimum guaranteed rate of return by law and are hence treated
as defined benefit (DB) plans. In practice, this guarantee is mainly covered by insurance companies. As there is no deficit as per
December 31, 2018, no liability has been recognized (2017: nil). The accumulated reserves of these plans are equal to the assets.
There are no risks to which the plan exposes the entity, focusing on any unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and of any
significant concentrations of risk.

###### 7.18. DEFERRED TAXES AND CURRENT TAXES

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and when the deferred taxes relate
to the same fiscal authority. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following items:

Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differences, tax attributes carried forward and tax losses carried forward to the
extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through the future taxable profits is probable.

The tax losses carried forward mainly relate to France, Belgium, Brazil and Spain. In Belgium and France, deferred tax assets
have been recognized on tax losses carried forward considering the expected taxable profits in the foreseeable future.

The Group did not recognize deferred tax assets of € 86.7 million (2017: € 95.2 million) on the tax losses carried forward (see
also note 7.4.1).


-----

In Spain, this relates to tax losses at the level of the Spanish subsidiary acquired as part of Grupo Mabe. In Brazil this relates to
tax losses at the level of the Brazilian subsidiaries. In both countries, tax losses can in principle be carried forward indefinitely but
the current profit levels in the relevant entities are such that no deferred tax asset has been recognized per December 31, 2018,
bearing in mind that in Brazil no tax consolidation is allowed and that in Spain pre-acquisition tax losses cannot be offset against
profits of legacy Ontex entities.

The Group did not recognize deferred taxes associated with investments in subsidiaries. There is currently no policy or detailed
plan in relation to the payment of dividends within the Group.

**Current taxes**

**in € million** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**

Current tax assets 12.5 7.1

Current tax liabilities (46.0) (50.9)

The current tax assets mainly relate to the excess of pre-payments made compared to the actual income tax payable for the year.
The current tax liabilities include an amount of € 35.6 million actual corporate taxes payable (2017: € 36.8 million) and € 10.4
million of provision for uncertain taxes (2017: € 14.1 million).

###### 7.19. CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 

Other current liabilities (excluding provisions, income tax liabilities, financial liabilities and liabilities directly associated with noncurrent assets intended for sale) can be presented as follows:

**in € million** **December 31, 2018** **December 31, 2017**

The Group recognizes a provision for certain legal claims filed against the Group by customers, suppliers or former employees.

On September 2, 2014, Ontex received a notification that the Spanish Competition Authorities (CNMC) opened infringement
proceedings against 15 companies in the sector (including three subsidiaries of the Company: Ontex Es Holdco, S.A., Ontex
Peninsular, S.A.U. and Ontex ID, S.A.U.) with respect to alleged conduct of fixing prices and other commercial conditions in the
Spanish market for heavy adult incontinence products. On May 26, 2016, following the investigation, the CNMC issued its decision.
In its decision it has found eight companies, including Ontex' Spanish subsidiaries guilty of being part of a cartel. For its
involvement from 1999 to 2014, Ontex was fined € 5.2 million. Ontex initiated an appeal against the decision and this appeal is
pending. As per December 31, 2016, a provision amounting to € 5.2 million has been accounted for. The provision has not been
adjusted per December 31, 2018.

-----

Items classified under the heading non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are considered by management not
to relate to items in the ordinary course of activities of the Company. The Group has adopted this classification to allow a better
understanding of its recurring financial performance.

These items are presented as follows in the consolidated income statement as follows:

 - income and expenses related to changes to Group structure; and

 - income and expenses related to impairments and major litigations

**7.23.1. Income and expenses related to changes to Group structure**

**Factory closure**

The Group announced in May 2018 the decision to transfer its manufacturing operation in Aparecida de Goiânia to its
manufacturing site in Senador Canedo, both in the State of Goiás. This move was made after an in-depth analysis and considering
the efficiency of combining the entire production into a single unit, where it will be possible to deploy efficient technologies and
processes. All alternatives were investigated to minimize impact on Ontex employees in Aparecida de Goiânia, the majority of
whom will transfer to Senador Canedo. The costs recognized to date relates mainly to the restructuring expenses (€ 5.9 million)
and impairment losses (see below in 7.23.2). The change will continue through 2019 in order to finalize the turnaround in Brazil.

**Business restructuring**

The Group undertook several projects to optimize the management of its business. In 2018, the expenses relate to the opening
of our new production facility in Poland, the fees incurred in the context of the unsolicited and non-binding proposal to a possible
cash offer for the outstanding shares in Ontex by PAI Partners SAS and the costs incurred in the context of the optimization of
the sales activities in Brazil.

In 2017, the expenses related to the move of the two existing factories in France into one new site. The 2017 costs further include
the costs for the move to a new production facility in Russia and the start-up of a new entity in Ethiopia, hosting both production

###### 7.27. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Since September 2014 the Company implemented yearly Long-Term Incentive Plans (‘LTIP’), which are based on a combination
of stock options (further ‘Options’) and restricted stock units (further ‘RSU’s’). The Options and RSU’s are accounted for as equitysettled share-based payments. The options and RSU’s can only vest and options giving the right to receive shares of the Company
(further ‘Shares’) or any other rights to acquire Shares can only be exercisable as from three years after the grant. The RSU and
Options will vest subject to the condition that the participant remains in service. The share price is considered to be the relevant
performance indicator and the vesting of the award will not be subject to additional specific performance conditions. The Articles
of Association authorize the Company to deviate from such rule, as allowed under the Belgian Companies Code.

The exercise price of the Options will be equal to the last closing rating of the Share immediately preceding the option grant date.
For the Options, the exercise period will start on the vesting date.

The Shares underlying the RSU’s will be granted for free as soon as practicable after the vesting date of the RSU’s.

Upon vesting of RSU’s, the Shares underlying the RSU’s are transferred to the participants, while upon vesting, Options may be
exercised until their expiry date (eight years from the date of grant).

On or about September 26, 2014, a total of 242,642 stock options and 49,040 RSU’s were granted, 69,644 options and 49,040
RSU’s have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2018. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable
between September 2017 and September 2022.

On or about June 26, 2015, a total of 159,413 stock options and 38,294 RSU’s were granted, 19,746 options and 38,294 RSU’s
have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2018. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable between
June 2018 and June 2023.

On or about June 15, 2016, a total of 322,294 stock options and 75,227 RSU’s were granted, 51,027 options and 11,909 RSU’s
have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2018. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable between

On or about May 10, 2017 a total of 299,914 stock options and 69,023 RSU’s were granted, 36,078 options and 8,303 RSU’s
have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2018. The stock options and RSU’s are exercisable between
June 2020 and June 2025.

During the period, the Group granted a new LTIP plan consisting of 471,064 stock options and 93,576 RSU’s, 37,406 options and
7,430 RSU’s have forfeited, expired or have been exercised as of December 31, 2018. The stock options and RSU’s are
exercisable between June 2021 and June 2026.

The Board of Directors of the Group has decided on June 1, 2015 to implement a full hedging program (total return swap) for the
share-based payment arrangements starting July 1, 2015 and renewed on an annual basis.

1 The average exercise price mentioned in the table above relates only to the stock options, as the RSU's do not have an exercise price.

² The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2018 was € 22.64 (2017: € 29.08).

The fair value of the stock options has been determined based on the Black and Scholes model. The expected volatility used in
the model is based on the historical volatility of the Company.

Below is an overview of all the parameters used in this model:

**LTIP 2014** **LTIP 2015** **LTIP 2016** **LTIP 2017** **LTIP 2018**

Exercise Price (€) 17.87 26.60 28.44 33.11 23.56

Expected dividends yield (%) 2.94% 2.14% 1.98% 2.31% 2.70%

Risk free interest rate (%) 1.13% 1.02% 0.37% 0.60% 0.69%

The fair value of the RSU’s has been determined by deducting from the exercise price the expected and discounted dividend flow,
based on the same parameters as above.

Social charges related to the LTIP are accrued for over the vesting period.
