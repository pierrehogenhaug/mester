For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’), for offering or selling any in scope instrument or otherwise making such instruments available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market._** Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (‘‘COBS’’), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (‘‘UK MiFIR’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ‘‘UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules’’) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. United Kingdom._** The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ‘‘EUWA’’) or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the ‘‘UK PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the ‘‘UK Prospectus Regulation’’) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Australia._** This Offering Memorandum is not, and is not intended to be, a disclosure document within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) of Australia (‘‘Australian Corporations Act’’). No action has been taken by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes in Australia.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,54,IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM,54.10,Non-IFRS Measures,54.10.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios, including Underlying EBITDA, Underlying EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Revenue, Pro Forma EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Pro Forma EBITDA, _Pro Forma EBITDA margin, Pre-IFRS 16_ _Pro Forma EBITDA, Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and exceptional items, Operating Cash Flow Conversion, Underlying Operating Profit and Underlying movement in net working capital that are not required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS (the ‘‘Non-IFRS Measures’’). We present these Non-IFRS Measures because they are measures our management use to assess operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS standards or other generally accepted accounting principles. The Non-IFRS Measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit from continuing operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. We define these Non-IFRS Measures as follows: - Underlying EBITDA consists of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and exceptional items and increases in credit loss provisions (as discussed in ‘‘Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’);_ - Underlying EBITDA margin consists of Underlying EBITDA divided by revenue; - _Pro Forma Revenue consists of revenue adjusted to give pro forma effect to the estimated full run-rate impact of our acquisitions of Estillon, Ascot, Keradom and Hanover, as if such acquisitions had occurred on September 29, 2019; - _Pro Forma EBITDA consists of Underlying EBITDA adjusted to give_ _pro forma effect to the estimated full run-rate impact of our acquisitions of Estillon, Ascot, Keradom and Hanover, as if such acquisitions had occurred on September 29, 2020; viii ----- - Pre-IFRS 16 Pro Forma EBITDA consists of Pro Forma EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the disapplication of IFRS 16—Leases for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020; - _Pro Forma EBITDA margin consists of Pro Forma EBITDA divided by Pro Forma Revenue; - Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and exceptional items consists of Underlying EBITDA before non-cash items and after Underlying movement in net working capital; - Operating Cash Flow Conversion consists of Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and exceptional items divided by Underlying EBITDA; - Underlying Operating Profit consists of operating profit before the impact of exceptional items and amortization of acquired intangibles; - Underlying movement in net working capital consists of movements in working capital before the impact of exceptional items; and - Like-for-like revenue growth represents the growth in our revenue shown on a constant currency basis and adjusted to remove the impact of acquisitions and restructuring effects. Underlying EBITDA, _Pro Forma EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16_ _Pro Forma EBITDA may be defined differently from the corresponding terms under the Indenture. Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 _Pro Forma EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of the limitations of Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 _Pro Forma EBITDA are:_ - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 Pro Forma EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required to make such replacements; - they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, Underlying EBITDA, _Pro Forma EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16_ _Pro Forma EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and by using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from publicly available information and independent industry publications. In particular, certain information has been derived from Global Flooring (January 2019) published by The Freedonia Group (the ‘‘Freedonia Report’’) and the EUROCONSTRUCT report published in November 2020 (the ‘‘EUROCONSTRUCT Report’’). The Freedonia Report includes data obtained from The Freedonia Group’s own research as well as data derived from other industry reports and publicly available information. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. We believe that these industry publications are reliable, but we have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum. We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the flooring industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling the data. Accordingly, the market statistics included in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed with caution and no representation or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial Purchasers, as to their accuracy.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading international designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. In each of our product segments, we have leading market positions in the markets in which we operate. We are a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. In soft flooring, we are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We manufacture and supply a diversified range of products, including carpet, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, luxury vinyl tile (‘‘LVT’’), artificial grass and flooring accessories. The majority of our products are for residential use, with a particular focus on the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market. We primarily target mid- to upper-market product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche product segments. Our customer base is diverse and focused on small, independent retailers with whom we can differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering superior service. We group our reported operating segments by product category and manufacturing geography. These segments, broadly divided into ceramic tile and soft flooring offerings, comprise: (i) UK & Europe— Ceramic Tiles, consisting of our ceramic tile manufacturing businesses in Spain and Italy; (ii) UK & Europe—Soft Flooring, consisting predominantly of our carpet, flooring underlay, artificial grass, LVT and flooring accessories businesses in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe; and (iii) Australia, consisting of our (predominantly carpet and flooring underlay) soft flooring businesses in Australia. In the 2020 financial year, ceramic tile accounted for 61.3% of our Underlying EBITDA, with soft flooring and other products accounting for the remaining 37.6% of our Underlying EBITDA (in both cases, excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). For the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we generated £673.5 million of _Pro Forma Revenue and £120.4 million of Pro Forma EBITDA (17.9% Pro Forma EBITDA margin). While we have grown largely through strategic acquisitions since 2013, like-for-like revenue growth was 1.6%, 2.0% and 0.4% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. Our revenue and Underlying EBITDA is diversified across a variety of products and geographies. Through a series of strategic acquisitions, we have developed a balanced operating model across ceramic tiles and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products, both in terms of product category and target price point. Although originally focused on soft flooring offerings, we have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. In particular, our Keraben, Serra, Saloni and Ibero businesses, together with our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, give us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic exposure. 1 ----- The following charts set forth our Underlying EBITDA by destination geography and product segment for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). 20FEB202101404069 (1) Geographic split is based on Underlying EBITDA split by destination. (2) This split assumes a consistent margin on sales across all geographies and for each business unit. (3) Includes small amounts attributable to LVT and other products. We have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. To build on the competitive advantage of our soft flooring capabilities, we expanded into the complementary flooring underlay market by adding flooring underlay operations in both the United Kingdom and Australia in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This was achieved through the acquisitions of Interfloor in 2015 and Ezi Floor in 2016, flooring underlay manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, and the 2016 acquisition of Dunlop, a flooring underlay manufacturer based in Australia. In response to robust growth in demand for artificial grass, we further expanded into the artificial grass market through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands in 2017. We entered the ceramic tile segment in Continental Europe through our acquisitions of Serra (Italy) and Keraben (Spain) in 2017, Saloni (Spain) in 2018, Ibero (Spain) in 2019 and Ascot (Italy) and Keradom (Italy) in 2020. These strategic acquisitions have given us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic footprint. In 2019, we also made the small acquisition of Estillon B.V., a small underlay distributor in Continental Europe, and further added to our soft flooring distribution offering in the United Kingdom with our acquisition of Hanover in January 2021. We believe we have achieved an optimal level of integration with respect to our recent strategic acquisitions, enabling us to develop a balanced operating model across ceramic and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products. We have a highly successful multi-brand strategy with over 30 brands encompassing mid- to upper-priced products. These include 14 carpet brands covering a broad range of wool and synthetic products, such as Victoria, Whitestone Weavers, StainFree and Quest; Westex and Hugh Mackay, two of our premium carpet brands; Duralay, Dunlop and Tredaire, leading and innovative flooring underlay brands; Keraben and Saloni, mid- to upper-market ceramic tile brands; Distinctive, Heartridge and Frontier, under which we sell high-end LVT products; and GrassInc and Avalon, under which we sell artificial grass products for a wide range of applications, including lawns, parks, sports grounds and indoor applications. We benefit from economies of scale through our consolidated manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our business is selectively vertically integrated, comprising three components: (i) the design and specification of the majority of our products; (ii) the manufacturing of the substantial majority of our products, with limited outsourcing in circumstances in which doing so is financially and operationally beneficial; and (iii) the distribution of our products based on their product category and customer proposition, which maximizes the turnover of our inventory and product efficiency. We believe that this balanced approach to vertical integration creates robust margins and increases our competitive advantage in our target markets. We believe we have competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate, including our design capabilities, large-scale and efficient in-house manufacturing facilities and our long-standing direct relationships with retailers across all operating businesses. We operate fourteen manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and three manufacturing sites in Australia. Our integrated in-house capabilities allow us to operate our production facilities flexibly, varying production levels to meet demand, while maintaining a low fixed cost base, high 2 20FEB202101404069 ----- efficiency and rigorous quality control. Where advantageous to do so, we have consolidated the design, manufacturing and distribution of certain products. Our core markets are the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, where we employ over 3,400 people across more than 20 sites. The largest end-market for our products is the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market, and, therefore, our business is less exposed to the economic cycles that otherwise commonly affect the smaller, cyclical construction end-market. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical segments in which they are manufactured, placing us in close proximity to our customer bases across core markets. Our relationships with our customers, the thousands of flooring retailers and small number of distributors and direct sales customers we supply across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are central to our success. We primarily sell directly to retailers. In the United Kingdom, our 3,000-plus customers range from independent retailers to distributors and large format chains. Some of these relationships, across operating geographies, are multigenerational and we believe the strength and depth of these relationships represent a significant competitive advantage. When coupled with our expansion since 2013, these relationships allow us to offer a broad range of products to our customers and further our cross-selling opportunities. We benefit from a large, diverse customer base with limited concentration. For the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Market-leading business with a focus on branded mid- to high-end products,"We have built a market-leading business across our core markets with a wide product range and global production and distribution capabilities. We are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, with approximately 14% market share, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia, with approximately 14% market share, and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both jurisdictions, in each case by volume as of March 28, 2020. We are also a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer in the mid- to upper-market ceramic tile segment by volume, with approximately 8% market share as of March 28, 2020. Our focus on upper-market products across the majority of our product segments is driven by the stronger and more resilient margins they generate as compared to lower-end flooring products. Upper-market product sales are generally less volatile than sales in the lower-end market, as end-consumers in the uppermarket generally have more stable spending habits; unlike many products in the lower-end market, mid- to high-end products also benefit from brand recognition, especially among retailers and wholesalers who are able to differentiate on the basis of brand quality and brand customer service. We believe that our market-leading positions across our key end-markets, together with our wide product range and our global distribution capabilities allow us to closely track and adapt to customer behavior while adjusting our production levels to match demand. Specifically, as a result of our presence in multiple product segments, our vertical integration and significant contacts across retailers, we are able to receive substantial feedback as to end-consumer trends in design and supply volumes on a timely basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,"Diversified business across products, geographies and customers","We have a diverse product portfolio consisting of wool and synthetic broadloom carpets, ceramic tiles, laminate, flooring underlay, LVT and other hardwood flooring products, artificial grass, carpet tiles and flooring accessories. These products are spread across over 30 brands. Notably, while we have sought to selectively expand our product portfolio, we have strategically elected not to enter into product markets characterized by low margins and high price competition, such as linoleum. We primarily target the mid- to upper markets and employ a commercially focused product development process to proactively manage our margins. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes inform one another and are designed to yield product specifications that align with our target customers’ price points while optimizing margins. Our customer relationships and manufacturing flexibility also aid diversification of our product portfolio. Our close relationships with our customers provide us with valuable feedback and enable us to adapt to changes in end-customer preferences. We are also able to avoid large-scale product warehousing because of our ability to rapidly scale production on short notice, allowing us to maintain lean inventory levels which further aid product diversification. 3 ----- The evolution of our product range has been targeted and deliberate, underpinned by selective acquisitions through which we have increased production flexibility and our product and geographical diversification. As a result of this careful expansion, we are not overly dependent on any particular product segment, with ceramic tile products, carpet products (including flooring underlay and accessories) and artificial grass constituting 61.3%, 34.4% and 4.3% of our Underlying EBITDA for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases), respectively. Additionally, we are not unduly dependent on any particular brand (with Keraben constituting the largest proportion of our revenues in the 2020 financial year at 19.6%) or geographical segment and have the flexibility to produce and serve multiple geographies and shift production as needed based on fluctuations in demand. In the 2020 financial year, 70.5% of our Underlying EBITDA by product destination (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases) was generated outside of the United Kingdom. Importantly, we have benefited from our diversity across geographies and customers during the SARSCoV-2 (‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic, as we were able to maintain relatively stable sales for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2020, notwithstanding governmentmandated lockdowns and restrictions in any single country. The chart below sets forth our Underlying EBITDA by product destination for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). 20FEB202101405212 Through our portfolio of over 30 brands, we offer a broad, differentiated and continuously evolving product portfolio for a variety of end-markets, including residential, office and hospitality and leisure. The breadth of these offerings provide us with a diverse customer base consisting of independent retailers, national retailers, Do-It-Yourself (‘‘DIY’’) retailers and buying groups, with over 3,000 customers in the United Kingdom, over 2,000 customers in Continental Europe and approximately 800 customers in Australia. These retailers are highly diversified across specialist, non-specialist, general and DIY sales channels. The chart below sets forth our customer distribution by sales channel (as a proportion of revenue) through the 2020 financial year. 20FEB202101404788 Significantly, the vast majority of our products are sold directly to independent flooring retailers rather than third-party distributors, which we believe drives brand loyalty and long-term relationships. Our involvement in the supply chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold directly to consumers, optimizing margins. Unlike some of our competitors, a minority of our revenue is generated from large retail chains. In the 2020 financial year, 43.8% of our revenue was generated from sales to independent retailers (including DIY retailers) while 22.8% was generated from sales to large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of our revenue. 4 20FEB202101404788 ----- We believe that the breadth of our product offering and the diversity of our revenue streams support the resilience of our business and that our sales of products across a number of attractive flooring segments increases our cross-selling opportunities, visibility and pricing power. We further believe that our broad product offering, expansive geographic footprint and diverse base of customers strengthen our position as a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products while positioning us for future growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Stable flooring market dominated by the less cyclical improvement and repair end-market,"The United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring markets are stable, mature and attractive end-markets. According to the Freedonia Report, the flooring industries in our core markets, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are forecast to grow at a combined compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of 1.3% between 2017 and 2022, with the I&R end-market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.4% over the same period. We believe that our rapid and successful expansion into the hard flooring market in Continental Europe, as well as our sizeable presence in Australia supported by our current optimization initiatives, collectively enable us to defend our position and take advantage of sustained demand for flooring products in the markets in which we operate. In addition to the stable forecast for the flooring industry generally, our business benefits specifically from our focus on the I&R end-market. The I&R end-market in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is approximately five to six times larger than the new construction end-market and has limited dependence on new construction activity. Demand for new flooring in the new construction end-market tends to lag overall growth in new construction and is typically more volatile than the I&R end-market due to the cyclical nature of new construction activity. Conversely, the I&R end-market, which is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to upgrade the appearance of existing homes, is characterized by greater price inelasticity and is typically less susceptible to business cycles, and, according to EUROCONSTRUCT, the residential renovation industry across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is expected to remain consistent and stable to 2023. Based on the composition of our customer base, we believe that over 90% of our revenues are generated from the I&R end-market. Notably, we have benefited, and continue to benefit from increased global demand for home decoration and renovation materials from consumers who are spending increasing amounts of time at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in countries which have implemented stringent COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures, home renovation activity has continued, helping us maintain sales in such markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,Established market position in an industry with high barriers to entry,"Over the course of our operating history, we have developed sufficient scale, expertise and breadth of product offering to succeed notwithstanding the significant barriers to entry in the flooring industry. We believe this business model would be difficult to replicate due to the following structural barriers to entry: - **Fragmented customer base: Our broad customer base is dominated by independent retailers, with whom we enjoy long-standing and, we believe, mutually beneficial relationships; - **Proximity to customers: Carpets are large, non-palletized goods and ceramic tiles are heavy, making both products difficult and expensive to transport. High transportation costs provide a barrier to low-cost international manufacturers from distributing their products within our geographical segments. Our operating businesses manufacture their products in close proximity to their customers and end-users, allowing us to minimize logistical costs; - **Difficulty in contract manufacturing: Long production runs are required in our industry in order to enable cost-effective manufacturing. As a result, contract manufacturing is generally not a feasible alternative to the owned production capabilities, which has been our approach; - **Strength of brands: We have a diverse portfolio of over 30 brands that we believe enjoy strong recognition with customers. New competitors in the mid- to upper-markets in which we operate would need to develop (organically or via costly acquisition) significant brand recognition in order to compete on a material level; - **Capital barriers: New entrants seeking to establish operations locally would face significant up-front capital costs; and - **Product understanding and technical know-how: We have been in continuous operation since 1895, currently employing 18 managing directors with an average of 20 years of industry expertise. Our 5 ----- ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure ensures that these expert local managers and their respective management teams exercise valuable discretion over the diverse products, customers and geographic markets with which they are intimately familiar, in conjunction with our highly-experienced group-level management team. We believe these barriers to entry protect our business from both the threat of inexpensive, international imports as well as new entrants to our local markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,"Low operational gearing through a flexible cost base, concerted efficiency-driving efforts and low capital expenditure requirements","We benefit from low operational gearing, with 52.3% of our cost base (which represented 43.3% our revenues) for the 2020 financial year varying directly with revenue. A further 35.5% of our cost base (which represented 29.4% of our revenues) for the 2020 financial year is semi-variable, with the ability to adapt within a few months. We have been able to maintain this low operational gearing despite being a manufacturing business by automating certain processes and because our equipment generally has a very long useful life. We also benefit from multiple production sites with the flexibility, capacity and cost structure to vary production levels, enabling our business to maintain efficiency in favorable markets and resilience through the more challenging parts of the business cycle. Our low operational gearing has been an asset during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we are able to decrease our variable costs to partially off-set reductions in revenue that may occur during government-mandated lockdowns. The following diagram sets forth the components of our cost base for the 2020 financial year, expressed in percentage of revenues, as a function of variability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Cost of sales[(1)]** **SG&A[(1)]** **Total cost base[(1)],9.3.1,Strong financial performance with proven resilience during economic downturns,"We have a track record of resilience throughout economic downturns. Our focus on the less cyclical I&R end-market made us less susceptible to the worst effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, and we successfully increased our revenue in each of 2006-2011. We also gained invaluable experience from this period, during which time consumers opted for less expensive forms of home improvement. While we shifted our sales mix to lower than average selling prices in order to protect sales volumes, we were able to utilize our flexible cost base to maintain our margins. After the global financial crisis, we expanded our product portfolio, developed a more efficient production footprint and introduced optimized inventory management. Our business is fundamentally broader and more diversified than it was at the beginning of the global financial crisis, as we have shifted from a pure carpeting business to a hard and soft flooring group over the past decade, with a range of carpet, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, LVT and artificial grass products. As a result of our increased scale through acquisitions and various operational initiatives, we optimized our production footprint and inventory management. We believe that these changes strengthened our business, especially as we also diversified geographically in both manufacturing and sales without over-exposure to any single geographic market. Since the change in our management in 2012, we have experienced a period of accelerated growth coupled with improvements in Underlying EBITDA margins, increasing from 7.2% in the 52 weeks ended March 29, 2014 (the ‘‘2014 financial year’’) to 18.3% in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. Further, we have maintained consistently high Operating Cash Flow Conversion, with Operating Cash Flow Conversion of 83.2% in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, and 85.0%, 110.0% and 99.4% in the 2020, 2019 and 2018 financial years, respectively. This strong free cash flow generation has historically allowed us to de-lever following new acquisitions, supported by relatively limited working capital requirements and stable capital expenditures that have grown in proportion to the growth in our business since 2014. We believe our prior experience and success in dealing with major economic downturns, aided by our experienced management teams across our operating businesses, has left us well-positioned to deal with the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our emphasis on operational agility, highlighted by our diversity in products and sales geographies, low operational gearing and our ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure, permits us to quickly adapt to dynamic local conditions, COVID-19 developments and idiosyncratic government responses to the pandemic. Among other advantages, we are able to change our sales mix, reduce variable costs and shift production capabilities all on short notice, all of which have allowed us to minimize the impact of the global pandemic. We believe we have robustly exhibited the resilience of our business for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, generating revenues of £305.5 million and Underlying EBITDA of £52.4 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 (£315.9 million and £58.5 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, respectively).",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Though we aim to maximize the realization of synergies following an acquisition, our strategy is primarily focused on acquiring high-quality, high-margin targets that we intend to operate as stand-alone propositions. We seek to acquire businesses that are growing and profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive advantages in production and distribution. Our acquisition targets generally possess sustainable above-average margins and are led by committed and capable management teams. We believe this focus on stand-alone business value allows us to minimize our downside acquisition risk while maintaining room for synergistic upside potential. Since the change in Group management in 2013, we have made 18 acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Keraben and Serra in 2017, Saloni in 2018, Ibero and Estillon in 2019, Ascot and Keradom in 2020 and Hanover in 2021. Over this period, our Underlying EBITDA has grown from £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to £111.9 million in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, and our Pro Forma EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020 was £120.4 million. 7 ----- Our increased scale through acquisitions has given us significant opportunities for margin improvement. We possess better buying power for raw materials and have consolidated our manufacturing, distribution, warehousing and logistics capacity. Additionally, the acquisition of production capacity and development of distribution facilities in close proximity to our clients is also a competitive advantage, as the high levels of customer dispersion typical in the flooring industry can generate substantial distribution costs. Our strategically located distribution facilities allow us to minimize these costs and access customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Through our increased scale, we have also been able to rationalize product lines, improve working capital management through SKU reduction and take advantage of cross-selling products through new distribution channels. As a result of the above, our acquisition strategy has resulted in realized margin synergies, as evidenced by the increase in our Underlying EBITDA margin from 3.3% in the 2013 financial year to 18.3% in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. We have a long history of creativity and innovation in the flooring industry, both technical and aesthetic, and we are well-positioned to develop, together with our customers, design concepts and create innovative products that are tailored to consumers’ tastes and preferences. Our strategic acquisitions in the ceramic tile and artificial grass segments position us to continue to offer products tailored to a contemporary audience. In particular, our Keraben, Serra, Saloni and Ibero businesses, together with our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, give us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic exposure. We continue to introduce new product collections every year to meet consumer preferences and trends.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Geoffrey Wilding, responsible for our rapid and successful expansion, joined the Group as Executive Chairman in 2012 and drives overall Group strategy. The 2020 financial year was Philippe Hamers’ third full year as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hamers has over 25 years of experience in the flooring industry, most recently chairing Europe’s largest carpet manufacturing operation before assuming his role with us. We operate a ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure that minimizes cost friction and red tape, while capitalizing on local expertise and allowing organic local strategies to flourish. Our international operating strategy is generated centrally by Group-level management, including budgeting, capital expenditure planning and cross-business operations. Complementing our Group-level strategy, we maintain a decentralized structure with managing directors responsible for the day-to-day management of each of our core operating businesses. Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each managing director develops their own strategy and tactics (reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets. This structure has also been an asset to us during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the managing directors of our core operating businesses and their management teams were able to react quickly and decisively when lockdowns were announced across our operating geographies. As our managing directors have an average of 20 years of industry expertise, many have been through a number of recessions over their careers, and we have been able to leverage this experience to adapt positively to rapidly changing conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our management team has a strong track record of identifying value-accretive acquisition targets, integrating the acquired companies and identifying and achieving synergies. In selectively growing our operations, we look for mature businesses with modern, well-invested production facilities, committed management teams, established distribution channels and competitive advantages in the relevant target market. Once a business has been acquired, we have historically been able to deliver significant production and purchasing synergies, which continue to drive growth in operating margins and improved like-for-like performance, as evidenced by five consecutive years of increasing EBITDA margins. An important part of our acquisition strategy is our focus on retaining the management teams at the operating companies we acquire, which is a strategy that has proved successful for the Group. We have retained nearly all members of management in post-acquisition earn-out periods and, out of the 18 acquisitions made by the Group since 2013, ten are either post earn-out or did not have an earn-out period. In addition, our divisional management teams have extensive experience in the flooring industry and we believe that their collective industry knowledge, technical expertise, and customer and supplier relationships will enable them to continue to grow our business and execute our strategies. 8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Further, as much of our plant and equipment is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a modular basis, our business requires a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash flows. Of our capital expenditures for the 2020 financial year, £25.4 million related to maintenance and £8.4 million related to growth. While our maintenance capital expenditures have increased on an absolute basis over the last three years, our maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue remained relatively stable, at 3.3%, 4.1% and 4.1% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. We have also increased efficiencies across our business by consolidating production in locations with excess capacity while rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. At the same time, we enhanced our logistics capabilities in the United Kingdom, which is our largest geographical segment. In 2017, we began the reorganization of our United Kingdom manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve productivity, manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our Kidderminster factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the relocation of our distribution center in the Midlands, which we completed in 2018. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our United Kingdom carpet production being shared between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. In 2019, we completed a similar initiative in Australia, which resulted in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have made further efficiency gains with the opening of our Southern Distribution Center near London, servicing all of our United Kingdom and Continental European carpet brands. In the 2020 financial year, we further increased our logistics capabilities through the in-sourcing of underlay delivery logistics, which has improved service levels and distribution flexibility, and additional investment in our logistics-focused subsidiary, Alliance Flooring Distribution. The foregoing initiatives have markedly improved the efficiency of our soft flooring businesses, resulting in increased logistics capacity and reduced delivery costs in the United Kingdom. We 6 ----- are also pursuing a number of smaller initiatives, begun in the 2020 financial year, to increase production capacity and operational efficiencies where possible. These include further consolidation of carpet manufacturing capabilities, improvements in underlay production and administrative cost reductions in our ceramic tile businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Strategy,9.4.1,Continue to generate sustainable organic top-line growth in selected product segments,"Our growth since 2013 has created a consolidated platform in carpeting, flooring underlay, flooring accessories, ceramic tile and LVT products. While the Group has grown over this period largely through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth was 1.6%, 2.0% and 0.4% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. We intend to continue to utilize our platform in order to defend our market position, develop new products, and leverage our distribution channels to drive organic top-line growth. When investing in our organic development, we target product segments in which we benefit from existing high margins and where we can increase operational efficiencies. For example, we benefit from high margins in our ceramic tile segments, and have completed investments in Keraben to increase ceramic production capacity. These investments include the development of a new production plant, which began production in 2020, the installation of new clay atomizers in floor and wall plants designed to increase clay reception capacity and the installation of new inkjet printing machines for wall and floor pressing and glazing processes. Additionally, in the 2019 financial year, we completed the installations of a continuous clay mill and floor tile production plant within Keraben facilities, fueling production synergies across Saloni and Keraben, and a further carpet finishing line in South Wales to grow our Australian carpet manufacturing capabilities. In 2019, we completed a similar initiative in Australia, which resulted in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have strengthened our UK logistics network, including through the establishment of our new Southern Distribution Center and the relocation of our Midlands Distribution Center. In addition to optimizing our cost base, these initiatives are a competitive advantage as they allow our customers to distribute their products more efficiently, which we believe will drive increased sales. We are also pursuing a number of smaller initiatives, initiated in the 2020 financial year, to increase production capacity and operational efficiencies where possible. These include further consolidation of carpet manufacturing capabilities, improvements in underlay production and administrative cost reductions in our ceramic tile businesses. While our primary focus is on sales to retailers and the I&R market, we also aim to grow our contract offering directly to end-market consumers, particularly within the hospitality and leisure and construction end-markets. Though our Whitestone operating business currently services clients within these end-markets, we have identified these end-markets as targets for organic expansion as our existing presence is minimal. In light of our growing ceramic tile and LVT product offerings, we have begun designing and creating products specifically for these product segments with our sales teams concentrating marketing efforts in these areas. We are also making targeted investments into new product development and associated marketing materials, aided by our selective acquisitions in new strategic areas in which we believe there is superior and sustainable market growth and high margins. For example, we have expanded into the attractive Continental European ceramic tile industry with our Keraben, Saloni, Serra and Ibero businesses, and our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom. Non-resilient flooring, mostly consisting of the ceramic tile segment, remains the most popular flooring solution across Continental Europe. Additionally, our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon give us a foothold in the rapidly expanding global artificial grass industry. We believe there are large, underpenetrated markets for these and other products and we intend to leverage the scale of our footprint and our diverse distribution channels in order to capitalize on these opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Strategy,9.4.2,Acquisitive growth to realize margin-driving synergies and integration,"We are a consolidator in a highly fragmented industry and believe we have built a reputation as a disciplined and credible acquirer. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives, the Group has grown from having Underlying EBITDA of £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to _Pro Forma EBITDA of £120.4 million for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. 9 ----- This growth supports our belief that the flooring market is suitable for further consolidation. Manufacturing in our industry is characterized by many small, inefficient and privately owned manufacturers. Further, we have been insulated from large-scale competition within the United Kingdom and Continental Europe as the largest global manufacturers operate in the United States. Small manufacturers offer potential economies of scale, stable backgrounds and typically operate in the I&R end-market, which is less sensitive to economic cycles. Most carpet manufacturers trade at or below net asset value and, therefore, incumbent owners are often keen to exit. With many retiring owners lacking a succession plan, we are seen as an ideal buyer among few buying players in the market. We are constantly sourcing new opportunities for acquisitive growth and aim to make two-to-three high-quality, complementary acquisitions per year while maintaining our disciplined leverage strategy. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic has motivated a number of incumbent business owners within the United Kingdom and Continental European flooring markets to look for exit opportunities, and we are in active discussions with potentially attractive targets as we continue to monitor acquisition opportunities. The acquisition origination process begins with a long list of market participants. Our policy is to avoid acquiring turnarounds, so we only invest in currently profitable and cash-generative businesses. After months of contact with the target’s management, and due diligence on the target’s operating sites and financials, we consider commercial and cultural fit, possible synergies and terms of the possible acquisition. In addition to our focus on well-run businesses with strong management teams, we stress contingent structuring of consideration, to motivate the target and to share downside risk. With strong, rational adherence to our acquisition strategy, we have been able to limit our downside risk. Our growth through acquisitions has allowed us to use our scale to drive operating margins. After an acquisition, we maintain the target’s customer-facing teams, such as design, branding, sales and marketing. This feet-on-the-ground approach allows for product and brand differentiation while simultaneously maintaining responsiveness to dynamic customer demand. At the same time, operational integration drives the realization of cost-savings synergies in procurement, production, logistics and IT. These initiatives result in better buying terms with suppliers of raw materials, better working capital management through SKU reduction and rationalization of product lines and manufacturing assets. Importantly, our acquisition strategy creates the potential for further future consolidation of manufacturing capacity. We are able to realize depot, fleet and load consolidation for a more efficient logistical process. More efficient retail network relationships created through consolidation also yield commercial synergies such as product bundling and cross-selling while further driving sales growth and SKU reduction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Strategy,9.4.3,Generate free cash flow to enable de-leveraging,"A hallmark of a successful flooring business is its generation of free cash flow and high cash conversion rates. These are due to the longevity of flooring manufacturing plants, the relatively low capital requirements of those plants, relatively inelastic demand, and price inelasticity. When coupled with our synergistic acquisitions, we have consistently been able to consolidate production capability, increasing utilization, reducing SKUs, increasing stock turnover and establishing favorable trading terms with suppliers and customers. Together, these elements have the effect of further increasing our free cash flow. High free cash flow, in turn, allows us to rapidly de-lever. Although much of our historical growth has been through acquisitions, we have successfully maintained stable net leverage in part by funding certain of these acquisitions through equity offerings. Maintaining low leverage ensures the long-term health of the Group and gives us headroom for further acquisitions. We had pro forma senior net leverage of 2.8x as of October 3, 2020 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). We intend to use our cash flow to decrease our overall leverage.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

We have been publicly listed since 1963, moving from the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market to its AIM Market in 2013. When Geoffrey Wilding joined as Executive Chairman in 2012, a new board was appointed to conduct a full strategic review of the Group. In 2014, Mr. Wilding acquired a controlling stake in the Group. Since our formation, we have grown beyond our initial soft flooring offerings and gained scale through acquisitions in the fragmented flooring industry diversifying both by product and geography. 10 ----- Since 2013, we have made 18 acquisitions across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia to become an international player in the flooring industry. In late 2017, we expanded our position in Continental Europe, with the acquisition of Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Both Serra and Keraben are Continental European hard flooring manufacturers. Also, in early 2017, in response to the robust growth of the artificial grass market, we gained artificial grass-manufacturing capability through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Recent Developments,9.8.1,COVID-19,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (‘‘COVID-19’’) and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses, and the related impact from closure of supply chains, customers and associated reduction in consumer demand have, and may continue to have, an impact on our operations. 11 ----- We continue to operate all of our manufacturing facilities globally, having reopened our production facilities in the United Kingdom over the course of the summer of 2020 after the cessation of temporary government-mandated shutdowns (our Continental European and Australian manufacturing facilities have maintained production throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, save for a seven-week lockdown in Australia from August to September 2020). Since October 2020, all of our manufacturing facilities globally have been operational. In order to protect our workforce and maintain the continuity of our operations, we implemented preventative measures including social distancing in the workplace, working from home procedures for office-based employees, wearing face coverings in communal areas, providing hand sanitizer and other personal protective equipment to employees, increasing the frequency of cleaning of our production facilities and emphasizing and educating our employees on proper personal hygiene. Partially due to the success of these measures, we have been able to manage our operations and employee absenteeism with minimal disruption. We have not experienced disruptions to our supply of raw materials as our key inputs (wool, synthetic yarn, polyurethane foam, clay and natural gas) are readily available from a multitude of global suppliers. Where necessary, we have called on other suppliers, redirected shipments and increased raw material stock orders in an effort to ensure continuity of the business. We have and continue to perform stock checks, monitor factory requirements and the capacity of our suppliers to prevent shortages. We have managed and will continue to monitor issues with raw material supply, the distribution of finished goods and the availability of operating personnel. As we sell our products globally, we transact with a diversified customer base. This diversity means that we are able to maintain relatively stable sales notwithstanding government-mandated lockdowns and restrictions in any single country (we estimate that, as of March 28, 2020, we generated approximately 60% of our revenues from outside of the United Kingdom). Consumers within countries which did not implement lockdowns have exhibited consistent demand since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Consumers that have exited lockdowns have also maintained demand as compared to historical levels, following initially strong increases subsequent to national reopenings. Importantly, as over 90% of our revenues as of March 28, 2020 were generated from the I&R market rather than new construction or commercial projects, we have and continue to benefit from increased global demand for home decoration and renovation materials from consumers who are spending increased amounts of time at home. Even in countries which have implemented stringent lockdown and quarantine measures, renovation activity has continued, helping us maintain consistent sales in such markets as compared to historical periods. As a result of the foregoing, we generated £611.1 million (2020: £621.5 million) and £111.9 million (2020: £118.1 million) of revenue and Underlying EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, respectively. Despite the initial decrease in demand during the early months of the pandemic, we experienced a quick rebound that was followed by strong sales in the months of October, November and December 2020. See ‘‘—Recent Trading.’’ For more information regarding the risks and associated uncertainties related to COVID-19 and its effect on our business and results of operations, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our _Industry and Our Business—We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business.’’_ Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, we have not accessed any government credit-line schemes. We maintained a robust liquidity position throughout the period, supported by our Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2020, we took the precautionary step of drawing down funds totaling A75.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to preserve financial flexibility. We did not utilize any portion of such drawings and repaid the amount in full in September, 2020. Furthermore, for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we incurred costs as a result of COVID-19 in the amount of approximately £0.8 million. For example, this included costs to sanitize and disinfect manufacturing facilities and provide personal protective equipment to our employees. These costs have been treated as an exceptional expense and have been excluded from our Underlying EBITDA for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020. 12 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Recent Developments,9.8.2,Recent Trading,"_The following information relating to our performance for the months of October, November and December, 2020, is derived from our internal management accounts for the months of October, November and December, 2020. This information has been prepared by management. It has not been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any procedures by our auditors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. Because this information is preliminary, it is subject to change and those changes could be material. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._ Our strong performance during the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 has continued into the months of October, November and December 2020, with the Group achieving all-time record revenues and operating profits in the three-month period. Despite the existence of lockdowns and other COVID-19-related challenges in various markets, trading for the period delivered revenues of approximately £184 million, an increase of approximately 16% on a constant-currency basis as compared to the equivalent prior-year period. This increase comprised: (i) an approximately 11% increase in our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment, driven by organic growth; (ii) an approximately 26% increase in our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment, driven by a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of Ascot in March 2020; and (iii) an approximately 9% increase in Australia, driven by organic growth. This performance was further driven by: - the high geographical diversity of our business, generating approximately 75% of our earnings from outside the United Kingdom. We sell our products to thousands of flooring retailers across Continental Europe, North America, the United Kingdom, Australasia and the Middle East; - the continued operation of all of our manufacturing facilities globally, with full production schedules, and the continued operation of our logistics centers which maintained deliveries to our customers during the period to satisfy demand while providing a COVID-19-safe environment for our staff. We intend to continue operations across all of our facilities in the current financial quarter; and - the sustainable competitive advantage generated by our strategic investment in logistics and distribution in the United Kingdom, which we completed in late 2019. The objective of this investment was to improve our customer experience, enabling retailers we supply to hold lower inventory levels (reducing their working capital and warehousing costs), while still maintaining confidence that our products would be received when required for installation. This level of customer service has been made possible by our scale (the revenues and investment required precludes most competitors from independently offering the same service), is highly valued by retailers and continues to drive an increased ‘‘share of wallet,’’ as evidenced by our UK revenues increasing by more than twice the estimated growth of the market overall. Despite these gains, our residential flooring market share in the United Kingdom is currently only approximately 15% and, therefore, we believe there is substantial headroom for continued growth. As reported in our results for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, our Underlying EBITDA margin postinitial lockdown (i.e., the period from June to September 2020) increased on a like-for-like basis by more than 300 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by investments in manufacturing and distribution and ‘bottom slicing’ of margin-dilutive products that have produced a sustainable competitive advantage. The positive trend in margin continued for the months of October, November and December 2020. As a result, Underlying EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended January 2, 2021 was £120.0 million—above that for the 2020 financial year, despite the inclusion of the COVID-19 lockdowns from April to June 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak was a global pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, social distancing requirements for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. Since October 2020, all of our manufacturing facilities globally have been operational. However, we cannot assure you that our facilities will not be closed, or our operations will not be disrupted, as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. Resurgences (or ‘‘waves’’) of COVID-19 are likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where these waves will occur, the duration of such waves, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of February 2021, subsequent waves of COVID-19 were significantly affecting many countries, including the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Uncertainty about the lifting of lockdowns and the return of business activity, as well as the possibility of future lockdown measures, could lead to lower demand from our customers, and we cannot provide assurance that the outbreak of COVID-19 or any resurgence of COVID-19 or outbreak of other contagious diseases will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. The circumstances of the current COVID-19 outbreak are changing rapidly, and at this time we are unable to reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our financial results and liquidity, as well as operations. However, future developments of the COVID-19 pandemic could give rise to circumstances that result in one or more of the following: - we could lose key customers, customers could become insolvent or we could have a reduction or volatility in demand for our products and services, which may be caused by, among other things: lower customer demand as a result of the temporary inability of consumers to purchase items that use our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship; customers modifying their inventory or fulfillment practices; governmental restrictions and business closings; or other changes in buying patterns; - we could face increased competition within the flooring industry, or from alternative products and services; - our sales may decrease as a result of restrictions on cross border movement of goods which may reduce our ability to timely obtain supplies and we may reduce the number of methods by which we transport our goods and impact our ability to deliver on time; - we could be subject to changes in laws and governmental regulations that adversely affect our business and operations; - we could face increased costs relating to the purchase of personal protective equipment and disinfectants, as well as decreased production due to, for example, the need to disinfect areas or 29 ----- enforce social distancing measures within our production facilities resulting in decreasing the number of employees in our facilities; - we could face increased costs or decreased production related to supply chain challenges or disruptions; - the third parties on which we rely, including suppliers of our raw materials and other operating materials and independent contractors, may fail to meet their obligations to us, or may face significant disruptions in their ability to do so; - we could be subject to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - we might lose key management and operating personnel; - we may be unable to develop or apply new manufacturing technologies; - we may experience a disruption or delay in executing our strategic capital initiatives due to travel restrictions and/or health and safety concerns limiting access to our sites; - we may be subject to disruptions in the supply or price of our raw materials; - we may face prolonged work stoppages at our facilities, including total or partial shutdowns of one or more of our manufacturing, warehousing or distribution facilities, as a result of illness, government restrictions or other workforce disruptions; - we may face higher employee compensation costs, as well as incremental costs associated with newly added health screenings, temperature checks and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees; - we may be impacted by government budget constraints, tax constraints or government shutdowns; - our goodwill and other long-lived assets could become impaired (we recorded an exceptional goodwill impairment of £50.0 million in the 2020 financial year relating to reduced forecast assumptions on the recoverable amount of all cash generating units as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated uncertainties); - our access to capital markets may be restricted, which could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, including those under the Notes; - we may be impacted by deterioration in the global credit, financial and economic environment, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows; - we may be subject to increased information technology (IT) security threats and reduced network access availability; and - our operations or the operations of our principal customers and suppliers could be designated as non-essential across our key markets. The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a severe impact on the UK, European and global economy generally and their effects will likely continue to be felt in the coming years. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on the severity and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, these and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors disclosed in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The extent of our success depends in large part on our ability to follow, gauge and react to trends in home decoration and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. In particular, as we continue to expand into new markets, we must continue to meet the demands of new consumers who may have different tastes and follow different trends. For example, we noted a significant increase in demand in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe for artificial grass and consequently acquired artificial grass manufacturers in Continental Europe to incorporate this into our product offering. If we are unable to identify or respond effectively to consumer preferences and demand, we may experience back orders, order cancellations or overstock, any of which would have a negative effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to launch competitive products in a timely or successful manner in response to shifts in consumer demand. Our failure to further 30 ----- develop and introduce new products attractive to the market could cause our reputation to suffer and our products to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our sales to decline.

Certain of our competitors may have greater resources and access to capital than we do, which may afford them a competitive advantage in the innovation, production and distribution of new or existing products. The arrival of new competitors, new products or new technologies developed by competitors could also affect our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our margins with respect to our competitors, particularly if new entrants gain access to one or more of our markets, or if competition intensifies for any other reason. Maintaining our competitive position could also require additional investments in new products and new manufacturing facilities, or further development of our distribution network, marketing and sales activities. These competitive pressures could lead to reduced demand for our products or force us to lower our prices, which would negatively impact our margins.

We therefore do not substantially rely on intellectual property and have no material proprietary rights relating thereto, aside from registered trademarks over our brand names. In keeping with industry practice, as our designs are, in general, not registered, our products have historically been and may continue to be reproduced by our competitors. As we have little recourse to prevent the reproduction of our products, if our competitors expand the reproduction of products that we have designed, and/or sell reproductions of our products to our customers at lower prices, our market share and/or operating profit may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Consumer preferences may shift and they may begin to prefer other flooring solutions due to changes in market trends, technological advancements in flooring products, or personal preference and we may lack sufficient scale and geographical footprint with respect to our flooring offerings in order to benefit from this shift. There can be no assurance that the products we offer will remain competitive within the general flooring market, or that consumers will continue to purchase flooring products in line with previous purchasing habits. We have invested significantly in our carpet and ceramic tile offerings and manufacturing capacity and, to the extent consumers in any single market or over multiple markets choose alternative flooring solutions, or if carpet and ceramic tile products were to fall out of favor in one or multiple markets, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

As part of our growth strategy, we evaluate opportunities for acquiring complementary businesses that may supplement, but not replace, our internal organic growth. Since 2016, we have acquired Ezi Floor, Dunlop Flooring, Avalon, GrassInc, Millennium, Keraben, Serra, Saloni (including Sanicova), Ibero, Estillon, Ascot and Keradom. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable complementary businesses or assets in the future. Any acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense. We may experience difficulties in integrating future acquired entities into our business, incur higher than expected costs and not realize all the anticipated benefits or synergies of these 31 ----- acquisitions, such as in logistics and manufacturing, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company and retain key management personnel, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources. The failure to successfully integrate these acquired businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring the businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations. Our acquisition strategy could further impact our financial statements, resulting in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets upon consolidation of these entities, as further described in our Consolidated Group Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or successfully integrating previously acquired companies. The future success of acquisitions may be affected if we fail to adequately assess the commercial aspects of an acquisition target, such as in our revenue projections, list of competitors or margin analyses. We may also fail to correctly estimate customer demand in a local market or may be unable to successfully establish our products in a new location. This risk is elevated in new international markets where our lack of experience may make it more difficult to assess customer preferences and local tastes. Although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Further, our market research analysis may prove to be inadequate, particularly due to factors that are difficult to assess due to insufficient data, such as in periods when market conditions are changing. As a result, our investments in new locations may not yield the anticipated returns that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Though we are not significantly exposed to the new construction end-market, the construction end-market is traditionally a large driver of demand in the flooring industry and is also affected by the cyclical nature of the economy. Our business tends to be influenced, in particular, by changes in consumer confidence, in disposable income, interest rates and the availability of credit. These factors can cause fluctuations in demand, and, as a result, in our sales volumes and margins. For example, the global economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 had a negative impact on the flooring industry and on our business. Though the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a material decrease in our revenues for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, consumer confidence continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and may deteriorate depending on the perceived or actual severity of its economic effects. See ‘‘—We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other _outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business.’’_ Economic activity remains dependent on highly accommodative macroeconomic policies and is subject to downside risks. The implementation of policies that are or are perceived to be less consumer-friendly may restrict economic recovery, and as such, there can be no assurance of a favorable change in consumer confidence. Such trends are also influenced by overall economic growth and a large number of other economic and socio-political variables, including interest rates, governmental economic policies, public spending and allocations for infrastructure, or a combination of the above factors. Additionally, economic and fiscal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by local governments are dynamic and difficult to predict, and could have an effect on consumer confidence. Further economic downturns could also impact consumer confidence, and therefore discretionary spending habits, and could cause the industry to deteriorate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain essential raw materials that we use, such as wool, synthetic yarn, polyurethane foam, clay and natural gas, may be subject to fluctuations in price and demand, and prices may increase to the point where these raw materials affect our profitability. Fluctuations and price volatility, more broadly, may be due to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the availability of supply (including supplier capacity constraints); general economic conditions; currency fluctuations; competitive demand by other industries for the same raw materials; and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Additionally, though the COVID-19 pandemic has not resulted in material increases to the prices of, or our ability to access, essential raw materials as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, global supply chains have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could in the future affect prices or our access to such raw materials. There can be no assurance that the essential raw materials that we require to manufacture our products will continue to be available at commercially reasonable prices in the future. In the event of a future increase in raw material prices, we may be unable to pass the resulting additional costs on to our customers in a timely manner, or at all, as we do not have a contractual right to pass such cost increases on to our customers. A failure to otherwise mitigate increased costs could result in lower margins, customer loss or revenue reductions.

These regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. If a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other enforcement action which could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences and could harm our reputation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Our businesses are subject to risks normally associated with international operations, including currency fluctuation risks and local business risks. Out of our total costs in the 2020 financial year, 17.0% were denominated in a currency other than the local operating currency. In particular, certain of our raw materials are purchased in foreign currencies, particularly in the case of our United Kingdom and Australian businesses, which have raw material expenses denominated in euro and U.S. dollars. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the relative competitive position of our manufacturing facilities, as well as our ability to market our products successfully in other markets. Our sales are principally invoiced in currencies other than the pound sterling and are then translated into pounds sterling at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to the euro and Australian dollar in any given period could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our customers may demand that we reduce our prices where any changes in currency exchange rates may have been beneficial to our operations. We are exposed to currency fluctuations when we convert currencies that we receive from the sales of our products into our reporting currency to pay salaries and other costs. Movements in exchange rates between our reporting currency (the pound sterling) and foreign currencies can also affect our ability to comply with financial covenants pertaining to our outstanding debt. We have raised, and will in the future continue to raise, financing in currencies (principally the euro) other than our functional currency. As at October 3, 2020, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions and the Post-Balance Sheet Transactions, 3.5% of our consolidated indebtedness was denominated in pounds sterling and 96.5% was denominated in euro. In addition, a significant proportion of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. As a result, to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the currency in which indebtedness is denominated or in which capital expenditure is to be incurred and we do not have sufficient cash flows in the respective currency to service such debt or capital expenditure, the effective cost of servicing such indebtedness or making such capital expenditure may be higher. In addition, exchange rate movements may also affect our available headroom in respect of certain financial covenants pertaining to our outstanding debt. We evaluate exchange rate risks from time to time and hedge our risks by entering into financing agreements in the currency to which we are exposed, and by using financial exchange rate derivative instruments. Our foreign currency hedging strategies may not adequately protect our results of operations or balance sheet position from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in losses or may limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates. Any significant adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro or Australian dollar will result in a decrease in our net sales as reported in pound sterling, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, forward exchange contracts to hedge our residual exposure to the pound sterling. As with all hedging instruments, there are risks associated with the use of such instruments. While limiting to some degree our risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing such hedging instruments, we potentially forgo benefits that might result from other fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are also exposed to the risk that our counterparties to hedging contracts will default on their obligations. We manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions meeting established credit guidelines.

On-time delivery is particularly important to our large retail and wholesale customers. Though we do own certain of our transportation infrastructure, a small number of our operating businesses deliver products through third-party services. We therefore have some dependency on the timely performance of these third-party service providers. Our ability to deliver products on time may be adversely affected by events or circumstances beyond our control, including, but not limited to, unforeseen events causing the shutdown of one or more of our production facilities, unforeseen increases in order volumes as a result of changes to the competitive landscape or otherwise, the failure of third-party freight carriers to meet scheduled delivery times, any prolonged shortage of freight capacity or other extended disruption of transport services, disruptions to transportation infrastructure, including roads or rail networks, or the failure of our IT platform. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including government measures taken to control the health consequences of the pandemic (which are unpredictable in nature and can be enacted on short notice), such as increased border and customs controls, could adversely affect our ability to product and deliver our products on time. If we are unable to produce and deliver our products in accordance with the timetable specified by our customers and maintain our on-time service delivery record, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Though our high-level operating strategy is generated at the Group level (including budget, capital expenditure planning and cross-business operations), we maintain a decentralized structure with managing directors individually responsible for the day-to-day management of the individual operating businesses. Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each manager develops their own plan and tactics (reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets. Thus, the loss of any member of our senior management team, including our managing directors, could harm our ability to operate effectively. To the extent that the services of members of our senior management team may be unavailable for any reason, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our Group. There can be no assurance that we would be able to locate or employ such senior personnel with the requisite level of experience on acceptable terms or on a timely basis. Our future success also depends upon our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including those with long-standing relationships with our suppliers and customers and those with relevant technical expertise. We compete with other companies to recruit and hire from a limited pool of potential employees with the required skill set and/or industry experience due to, among other things, a shortage of potential employees with the requisite skills and experience in the industry. In addition, the training of new employees requires a large amount of our time and resources. If one or more of our key personnel resigns to join a competitor, the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential customers to any such competitor could harm our business. Our 35 ----- failure to maintain competitive compensation packages, including equity incentives, may also be disruptive to our business. In addition, we may be unable to prevent the disclosure or use of our technical knowledge, practices or procedures by departed personnel.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business,13.1.16,Disruptions in our production could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"We have manufacturing facilities across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia. Our facilities generally specialize in a particular product segment, making it difficult to replace production in one facility with production from another. If a disruption occurs at one or more of these production facilities, we could experience temporary shortfalls in production, an increase in our production costs, or quality issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The production at our plants could be adversely affected by extraordinary events, including fire, explosion, release of high-temperature steam or water, structural collapse, machinery failure, chemical spill, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, road construction or closures of primary access routes, earthquake, flood, windstorm or other severe weather conditions. Although we carry insurance covering losses at these facilities and insurance to cover interruptions in our business, that insurance is subject to limitations such as deductibles and maximum liability amounts and therefore may not cover all of our losses or recover the business lost to our competitors. We may incur losses that are outside of the coverage of our insurance policies. In the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at current levels or at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on the coverage that we maintain. As a result, we could experience significant losses if any of our manufacturing facilities were damaged or ceased operation for any other reason, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to completely or partially use our other production facilities to compensate for or mitigate the effects of any such shutdowns. Any disruptions at our production facilities could compromise our production capacity and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our South Wales factory experienced a roof collapse in January 2018, which damaged one of two finishing lines for several weeks. The shutdown of this finishing line impacted operations, margins and sales. Although we received compensation for these losses through our insurance provider, we may in the future incur losses that are outside the coverage of our insurance policies. Additionally, government-mandated lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic required us to temporarily shut down all of our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom from March to May 2020, and the majority of our Australian manufacturing facilities for the months of August and September 2020. Though these shutdowns did not result in a material decrease in our revenues for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, there can be no guarantee that future government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will not require further shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of February 2021, subsequent waves of COVID-19 were significantly affecting many countries, including the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging and new government-mandated restrictions cannot be excluded in the future.

We may be required to manufacture at our own expense replacement products if they fail to meet our customers’ standards, expectations and/or the applicable health and safety standards of the country in which a product is distributed, and we may be subject to product liability claims in connection with the foregoing. We may incur significant expenditures as a result of product recalls or product liability claims. We may also suffer other commercial and financial consequences in connection with manufacturing defects or product liability claims, including fines and payments to customers in respect of destroyed inventory, out-of-stock penalties and consumer complaints. Furthermore, if our products fail to meet our customers’ specifications, the customer relationship may be terminated. 36 ----- Any manufacturing defects or product liability claim against us could also subject us to adverse publicity. In addition, we may be subject to adverse publicity relating to other matters, including, but not limited to, product quality, brand image, complaints, production facilities and employee relationships. Adverse publicity may negatively impact our reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to any of our products, brands or production facilities may extend far beyond the product, brand or facility involved to affect some or all of our other products, brands and facilities.

The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex. In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and sales and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. The environmental, health, hygiene and safety regulations with which we must comply relate primarily to industrial safety, carbon and other emissions, and discharge of chemicals or dangerous substances (including industrial waste and chemicals used in our production processes, such as dyes); their use, production, traceability, handling, transport, storage and elimination or exposure to such substances; and the remediation of industrial sites and environmental clean-up. Such regulations more heavily affect our ceramic tile manufacturing business than our carpet manufacturing business. Legislation in these areas typically has become broader and stricter over time, and enforcement has tended to increase (resulting also in contractual obligations and responsibilities in these areas being imposed on the Group). In addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. Complying with these regulations may require us to incur significant expense, especially in relation to spillages of dyes and other chemicals. We cannot predict the amount of any increase in capital expenditure or operating expenses that we may incur to comply with applicable environmental or other regulatory requirements, or whether we will be able to pass on these costs to our customers through price increases. Additionally, the tightening of regulations applicable to certain substances that we use could force us to use more expensive substances, change our formulations, decreasing the profitability of our products. It is difficult to anticipate changes to the foregoing laws and regulations or to their interpretation, which could lead to significant expense or investment. If we are unable to obtain or comply with required permits and approvals for our operations, or in the event of the possible imposition of fines or undertaking of capital investments in the aforementioned cases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. 37 ----- The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the terms of the new trade and cooperation agreement have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the United Kingdom to re-establish their place in the European Union by separating from the United Kingdom. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings have been and may continue to be subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, tax and customs laws, intellectual property rights, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, employment laws and transport laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the United Kingdom, increase costs, disrupt supply chains and depress economic activity. The loss of access to the single European Union market and customs union may result in an impact on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, which could directly impact the financial condition of our customers which could have a negative impact on our revenues. A significant weakening of economic conditions in the United Kingdom could also affect internal demand for our products as a byproduct of potentially slowed activity in the residential and commercial renovation markets.

Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, wage rates, union membership levels and activity among our employees and changes in employment and labor or other workplace regulation. Our labor costs could also increase due to, among other things, any potential re-characterization of independent contractors as employees or other challenge to employment or compensation arrangements with our personnel. If we were unable to pass on such higher costs to our customers or otherwise mitigate such increases, these higher labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As our business is labor intensive, maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, increased costs of labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity, could delay or impede production and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. As a portion of our manufacturing employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also subject to the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation.

Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities, including, among other reasons, because tax laws and regulations in effect in the various countries in which we operate do not always provide clear and definitive guidelines. Our effective tax rates and tax exposure could be affected by changes in the composition of our earnings in countries or jurisdictions with higher or lower tax rates, changes to transfer pricing rules, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, our ability to utilize tax losses and tax credits, changes to interest deductibility or other changes in the tax laws and the way such tax laws are applied by tax administrations (possibly with retroactive effect), including through tax arrangements issued by the relevant competent tax authorities. Non-recoverable VAT rates could increase in the future in countries in which we operate. If we do not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted. If we pass the increase in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may decline, materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have VAT risks arising out of the operating activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations. Certain markets in which we operate have transfer pricing mechanisms that require transactions involving associated companies to be at arm’s length. Arrangements between members of our group, such as intragroup transactions involving management services, royalties, information technology service fees, cash-pooling arrangements, intra-group loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried out on an arm’slength basis. However, if the tax authorities in any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as being made on an arm’s-length basis and successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax payable by the relevant member or members of the group, in respect of both current and previous years, may increase materially and penalties or interest may be payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer pricing documentation evidencing the outcome of applied pricing principles, should they be requested by the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties. In addition, we are subject to regular audits of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the various countries in which we operate. From time to time various governments together with the European Union and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including changes potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international earnings. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and amendments to tax laws and regulations in order to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations under the Notes through a combination of dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans and repayment of intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or Guarantees of obligations under, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Notes. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. If our subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Specifically, the Collateral is located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and Australia, and the multijurisdictional nature of any enforcement of the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. In addition, the security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, under the laws in certain of the jurisdictions where the Collateral is located, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of _the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’ Third party consent may be_ needed to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that any such consents will be obtained.

See ‘‘Limitations on Validity _and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_ Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, Guarantees and security interests can be challenged (for example, by the bankruptcy receiver or insolvency trustee, in the case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor 47 ----- outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents) or by any party granting the security interests and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or to the party granting the security interests, if the court found, inter alia, that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or the above-referred party was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor or the party granting the security interests did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor or such party was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/ Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or of such party. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a party granting the security interests was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or its security interests were granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted unfair or voidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or voidable conveyances on other grounds. The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurances that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we make dividends. The payment of dividends by a Guarantor or by the party granting the security interests to the Issuer to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to those Guarantors or parties to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees or the Security Documents. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. In addition, judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in Spain, Australia or the Netherlands. Instead, as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor test. Several of the factors the court will consider involving a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may require considerable time to complete. For all of the foregoing, an investment in the Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or may apply differently in a differently structured bond offering. If any of these risks materialize, your ability to collect payments of principal and interest under the Notes may be materially adversely affected.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain and Australia or another relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and 48 ----- otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or incorporation or any other relevant jurisdictions where proceedings are opened may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to allow us to purchase the Notes or we may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which, in turn, would constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indenture and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control.’’_ The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control,’’ the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the applicable Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. 49 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities, including our Existing Notes. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

In addition, as a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain or Australia.

In addition, the enforcement in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain or Australia of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading international designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. In each of our product segments, we have leading market positions in the markets in which we operate. We are a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. In soft flooring, we are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We manufacture and supply a diversified range of products, including carpet, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, luxury vinyl tile (‘‘LVT’’), artificial grass and flooring accessories. The majority of our products are for residential use, with a particular focus on the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market. We primarily target mid- to upper-market product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche product segments. Our customer base is diverse and focused on small, independent retailers with whom we can differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering superior service. We group our reported operating segments by product category and manufacturing geography. These segments, broadly divided into ceramic tile and soft flooring offerings, comprise: (i) UK & Europe— Ceramic Tiles, consisting of our ceramic tile manufacturing businesses in Spain and Italy; (ii) UK & Europe—Soft Flooring, consisting predominantly of our carpet, flooring underlay, artificial grass, LVT and flooring accessories businesses in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe; and (iii) Australia, consisting of our (predominantly carpet and flooring underlay) soft flooring businesses in Australia. In the 2020 financial year, ceramic tile accounted for 61.3% of our Underlying EBITDA, with soft flooring and other products accounting for the remaining 37.6% of our Underlying EBITDA (in both cases, excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). For the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we generated £673.5 million of _Pro Forma Revenue and £120.4 million of Pro Forma EBITDA (17.9% Pro Forma EBITDA margin). While we have grown largely through strategic acquisitions since 2013, like-for-like revenue growth was 1.6%, 2.0% and 0.4% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. 58 ----- Our revenue and Underlying EBITDA is diversified across a variety of products and geographies. Through a series of strategic acquisitions, we have developed a balanced operating model across ceramic tiles and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products, both in terms of product category and target price point. Although originally focused on soft flooring offerings, we have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. In particular, our Keraben, Serra, Saloni and Ibero businesses, together with our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, give us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic exposure. The following charts set forth our Underlying EBITDA by destination geography and product segment for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). 20FEB202101404069 (1) Geographic split is based on Underlying EBITDA split by destination. (2) This split assumes a consistent margin on sales across all geographies and for each business unit. (3) Includes small amounts attributable to LVT and other products. We have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. To build on the competitive advantage of our soft flooring capabilities, we expanded into the complementary flooring underlay market by adding flooring underlay operations in both the United Kingdom and Australia in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This was achieved through the acquisitions of Interfloor in 2015 and Ezi Floor in 2016, flooring underlay manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, and the 2016 acquisition of Dunlop, a flooring underlay manufacturer based in Australia. In response to robust growth in demand for artificial grass, we further expanded into the artificial grass market through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands in 2017. We entered the ceramic tile segment in Continental Europe through our acquisitions of Serra (Italy) and Keraben (Spain) in 2017, Saloni (Spain) in 2018, Ibero (Spain) in 2019 and Ascot (Italy) and Keradom (Italy) in 2020. These strategic acquisitions have given us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic footprint. In 2019, we also made the small acquisition of Estillon B.V., a small underlay distributor in Continental Europe, and further added to our soft flooring distribution offering in the United Kingdom with our acquisition of Hanover in January 2021. We believe we have achieved an optimal level of integration with respect to our recent strategic acquisitions, enabling us to develop a balanced operating model across ceramic and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products. We have a highly successful multi-brand strategy with over 30 brands encompassing mid- to upper-priced products. These include 14 carpet brands covering a broad range of wool and synthetic products, such as Victoria, Whitestone Weavers, StainFree and Quest; Westex and Hugh Mackay, two of our premium carpet brands; Duralay, Dunlop and Tredaire, leading and innovative flooring underlay brands; Keraben and Saloni, mid- to upper-market ceramic tile brands; Distinctive, Heartridge and Frontier, under which we sell high-end LVT products; and GrassInc and Avalon, under which we sell artificial grass products for a wide range of applications, including lawns, parks, sports grounds and indoor applications. We benefit from economies of scale through our consolidated manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our business is selectively vertically integrated, comprising three components: (i) the design and specification of the majority of our products; (ii) the manufacturing of the substantial majority of our products, with limited outsourcing in circumstances in which doing so is 59 20FEB202101404069 ----- financially and operationally beneficial; and (iii) the distribution of our products based on their product category and customer proposition, which maximizes the turnover of our inventory and product efficiency. We believe that this balanced approach to vertical integration creates robust margins and increases our competitive advantage in our target markets. We believe we have competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate, including our design capabilities, large-scale and efficient in-house manufacturing facilities and our long-standing direct relationships with retailers across all operating businesses. We operate fourteen manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and three manufacturing sites in Australia. Our integrated in-house capabilities allow us to operate our production facilities flexibly, varying production levels to meet demand, while maintaining a low fixed cost base, high efficiency and rigorous quality control. Where advantageous to do so, we have consolidated the design, manufacturing and distribution of certain products. Our core markets are the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, where we employ over 3,400 people across more than 20 sites. The largest end-market for our products is the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market, and, therefore, our business is less exposed to the economic cycles that otherwise commonly affect the smaller, cyclical construction end-market. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical segments in which they are manufactured, placing us in close proximity to our customer bases across core markets. Our relationships with our customers, the thousands of flooring retailers and small number of distributors and direct sales customers we supply across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are central to our success. We primarily sell directly to retailers. In the United Kingdom, our 3,000-plus customers range from independent retailers to distributors and large format chains. Some of these relationships, across operating geographies, are multigenerational and we believe the strength and depth of these relationships represent a significant competitive advantage. When coupled with our expansion since 2013, these relationships allow us to offer a broad range of products to our customers and further our cross-selling opportunities. We benefit from a large, diverse customer base with limited concentration. For the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.1,Product and Geographic Mix,"We offer an extensive range of mid- to upper-market flooring products in a variety of designs across our hard and soft flooring product segments, which comprise ceramic tiles, carpet, underlay and accessories and LVT. As the margins on our products vary, changes in the mix of our product sales have a direct impact on our total revenue and profitability. We typically achieve higher margins on sales in our hard flooring segments, and, as a result, growth in these product segments relative to our soft flooring segments generally results in improved overall profitability. The margins in our hard flooring segment are typically higher than the margins in our soft flooring segment because, in Continental Europe and globally, demand for hard flooring products is high, with supply concentrated in small pockets of regional expertise. The fact that the design of hard flooring products tends to be more varied and intricate also contributes to their higher margins. In addition, the fact that our businesses are technologically well-invested has further contributed to our margins. In order to take advantage of the higher margins in the hard flooring segment, we expanded into the ceramic tile (a type of hard flooring product) market through our acquisitions of Serra and Keraben in 2017, Saloni in 2018, Ibero in 2019 and Ascot and Keradom in 2020. The resulting shift in our product mix has been a significant factor in increasing our Underlying EBITDA margin from 15.2% in the 2018 financial year to 18.3% in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. 60 ----- The following charts set forth our 2020 Underlying EBITDA by destination geography and product segment. 20FEB202101404069 (1) Geographic split is based on Underlying EBITDA split by destination. (2) This split assumes a consistent margin on sales across all geographies and for each business unit. (3) Includes small amounts attributable to LVT and other products. Additionally, our range of products have varying margins in the different geographic regions in which we operate and, therefore, our geographic mix impacts our results of operation. Through our Keraben, Saloni, Serra and Ibero businesses, and our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, we have significant geographic diversity of sales. In the 2020 financial year, we sold our products in more than 20 countries globally. The United Kingdom, Australia, Spain and France are our largest markets, representing 40.8%, 14.0%, 15.0% and 7.8% of our revenue, respectively, for the 2020 financial year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.2,Consumer Preference and Demand,"Based on the composition of our customer base, we believe that the substantial majority of our revenues are generated in the I&R end-market. We focus on the I&R end-market as it is five to six times larger than the new construction end-market in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and also less cyclical. Consumer decisions regarding the redecoration and renovation of existing properties are therefore a major driver of our business. Our business is therefore affected by our ability to design and manufacture new and attractive products in line with consumer preferences as well as overall consumer demand in the I&R end-market. Consumers typically base their decision to purchase our products on a broad range of factors, including color, design, texture, shape, dimensions, pile height and density, price and other structural and technical features. In order to satisfy this broad range of preferences, we have built a portfolio of over 30 brands, have experienced design teams that are specific to these brands and have well-invested manufacturing equipment to support new product lines and adapt to shifts in demand. We aim to have optimal reach across the mid- and upper-market in our product segments, which allows us to deliver strong and sustainable margins. Demand for new flooring in the I&R end-market is typically less volatile than the new construction end-market. As the I&R end-market is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to upgrade the appearance of existing homes, this market is characterized by greater price inelasticity and less susceptibility to fluctuations in the business cycle. While impacted by macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, the level of employment, real wage levels and consumer confidence, we believe that demand for flooring in the I&R end-market is, to a certain degree, less susceptible to short-term macroeconomic fluctuations, as consumers can decide to repair or upgrade their flooring independently of other home improvement decisions. Notably, in the 2020 financial year and in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we have benefited, and continue to benefit from increased global demand for home decoration and renovation materials from consumers who are spending increasing amounts of time at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in countries which have implemented stringent COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures, renovation activity has continued. We seek to follow consumer preferences and demand trends closely, using a systematic approach to collection planning, and maintaining a short design-to-product cycle. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes are mutually reinforcing, resulting in product specifications that 61 20FEB202101404069 ----- align with our target customers and price points while ensuring optimal margins. We have the ability to set up our machines and re-engineer our production facilities, as well as increase our production capacity to manufacture new and different products in response to changing trends and consumer preferences. In addition, the breadth of our product offerings and our ability to redeploy our machines to make new designs makes us less subject to the success or failure of any given collection.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.3,Cost Base and Operational Improvements,"We are a manufacturer and therefore rely on well-invested production equipment, labor and raw materials to run our business. Of our cost of sales (excluding depreciation) in the 2020 financial year, materials (including other direct costs such as packaging) comprised 71.2%, labor comprised 18.2% and overhead comprised 10.6%. We are dependent on certain key raw materials, including synthetic yarn, wool, clay and polyurethane foam, and therefore our margins are impacted by variations in the cost of these raw materials. We manage the purchase of our key raw materials carefully, leveraging our scale and engaging with multiple suppliers in order to optimize pricing and security of supply. See ‘‘—Macroeconomic Factors—Raw Material _Expenses.’’_ Despite being a manufacturing business, we have a relatively low fixed cost base as a result of our automation of certain processes as well as the fact that our equipment generally has a very long useful life, given proper maintenance. We estimate that 52.3% of our cost base (which represents 43.3% of our revenues) for the 2020 financial year vary directly with revenue. A further 35.5% of our cost base (which represents 29.4% of our revenues) for the 2020 financial year is semi-variable, in respect of which we have the ability to adapt within a few months. In order to ensure that our manufacturing process is nimble and cost-effective, we are required to periodically make capital investments in our plant and equipment, which is further translated into depreciation on our income statement. Additionally, our business requires a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash flows; of our capital expenditures for the 2020 financial year, £25.4 million related to maintenance (2019: £23.5, 2018: £14.1 million) and £8.4 million related to growth (2019: £20.9 million, 2018: £15.2 million). We spent £11.3 million on capital expenditures in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, of which £9.1 million related to maintenance and £2.2 million related to growth. Further, following the acquisition of a new business, we look to realize operating cost synergies in order to drive margin enhancements. The purpose of these initiatives is to drive better buying terms with suppliers of raw materials, better working capital management through SKU reduction and rationalization of product lines and manufacturing assets. Realizing these operating synergies improves our margins by allowing us to manufacture our products more efficiently, including across a wide range of different SKUs, and allowing us to plan our production requirements in line with shifts in demand. We organize our operations so that we can flexibly shift production in line with changes to product specifications and to accommodate new designs. Through our acquisitions since 2013, we have significantly increased the scale of our operations in the United Kingdom and in the carpet segment, in particular. As a result of this increased scale, and to optimize our cost structure, we embarked on two restructuring initiatives in the United Kingdom: one with respect to manufacturing and one with respect to logistics. In 2017, we closed our Kidderminster factory, resulting in our UK carpet production now being shared between factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We recently completed a similar initiative in Australia, which has resulted in the consolidation of our two underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility. We have also completed the relocation of our Midlands Distribution Center and opened our Southern Distribution Center near London. We are still in the process of refining the multi-site operation of these distribution centers. The total cost of these projects incurred in the 2018 financial year was £4.5 million plus certain one-off capital expenditures equal to £3.3 million. In the 2020 financial year, we further increased our logistics capabilities through the in-sourcing of underlay delivery logistics, which has improved service levels and distribution flexibility, and additional investment in our logistics-focused subsidiary, Alliance Flooring Distribution. We have also begun construction on a new storage warehouse for finished carpet rolls in Wales to reduce the cost of volume shipments and reduce pressure on our other logistics centers located in England, which we expect will be completed in March 2021. The total cost of these projects incurred in the 2020 financial year was £2.2 million. 62 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.4,Business Relationships and Customer Success,"We generally operate a business-to-business sales model and therefore rarely access the end-consumer directly. Therefore we rely on our customers’ ability to sell and market our products effectively in order to increase our revenue and generate sustainable cash flows. As our customers grow, they tend also to increase their orders with us. We thus seek to maintain strong relationships with our customers and work side-by-side with them to help increase store traffic and grow their business. We predominantly focus on selling directly to retailers, which represented 66.6% of Group revenue for the 2020 financial year. Approximately two-thirds of our direct sales to retailers are made to specialist retailers, with the rest going to either national retail chains or DIY retailers. We also sell certain of our products in certain jurisdictions to wholesalers where there is a structural or commercial rationale for doing so, and engage in a small amount of contract work for the construction or hospitality industry representing 1.0% of Group revenue for the 2020 financial year. We have developed what we believe are deep, longstanding relationships with our customers. We benefit from a broad range of customers with little concentration. The diversity of our customers across geographies means that we have been able to maintain relatively stable sales notwithstanding government-mandated lockdowns and restrictions in any single country (we estimate that, as of March 28, 2020, we generated approximately 60% of our revenues from outside of the United Kingdom). Notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced materially decreased demand from our top ten customers in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. For the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of total revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of total revenue. In addition to ensuring low customer concentration, this diverse network of independent retailer customers presents a significant barrier to entry for new market participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.5,Macroeconomic Factors,"_General Economic Conditions and Industry Environment_ Our results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, as well as the conditions affecting consumer spending on flooring in the markets in which we operate. Such conditions include levels of employment, consumer confidence, inflation, growth in GDP, real disposable income, currency exchange rates, interest rates, home prices and the availability of consumer credit. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect global macroeconomic conditions, impacting global consumer confidence and GDP growth. All of the markets in which we operate have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we believe our prior experience and success in dealing with major economic downturns has left us well-positioned to deal with the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Group was resilient throughout the 2008 financial crisis, increasing revenue in each year of the 2006-2011 financial period. While we shifted our sales mix to lower than average selling prices to protect sales volumes, we were able to utilize our flexible cost base to protect our margins. As macroeconomic indicators like GDP, real wages and employment levels improved across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia subsequent to the global financial crisis, we saw an increase in the rate of growth in the flooring market, and we believe that a similar increase is possible once the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are brought under control and macroeconomic conditions stabilize. Overall economic conditions typically have a direct impact on the specific markets that drive our business, although market sensitivity varies, depending on the product. Our business is focused on the I&R end-market, which is less susceptible to the effects of an economic downturn than the new construction end-market, which typically fluctuates in line with the overall business cycle. Additionally, we target the mid- and upper-markets of the flooring market, which have historically been more resilient during economic downturns. During an economic downturn, raw material prices typically decrease, which can mitigate the adverse effect of potential volume decreases. We also believe that our strategic goal of expanding our presence in Continental Europe and Australia have increased our geographic and product diversification, and thereby allow us to further mitigate the impact of changes in local and regional economic conditions and consumer preferences. For example, uncertainty around the United Kingdom and Eurozone economic outlooks, driven by the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, is mitigated by the operational independence of our United Kingdom and Continental European divisions and the fact that neither is heavily reliant on imports or exports. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business— 63 ----- _The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’) may have a negative effect on global or regional economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.’’ Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_ We operate internationally and, as a result, are exposed to changes in the value of our operational currencies, the pound sterling, the euro, the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar. For the 2020 financial year, 40.6% of our revenue was denominated in pound sterling, 15.3% of our revenue was denominated in Australian dollars, and 44.1% of our revenue was denominated in euro. As a consequence, we have considerable cash flow, earnings and assets in currencies other than our reporting currency, which is the pound sterling. Our exposure to changes in exchange rates may be described in terms of translation exposure and transaction exposure. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business— _Our operations require the use of several different currencies, exposing us to both transaction and translation effects of exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect our profitability, costs and ability to repay indebtedness or comply with certain maintenance covenants.’’_ Translation risk is the risk that exchange rates impact the value of our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities reported in pounds sterling in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The weakening of the pound sterling relative to our other operational currencies will result in an increase in our revenues and costs as reported in pounds sterling. For example, since the national referendum in the United Kingdom on Brexit in June 2016, the value of the pound sterling relative our other operational currencies has declined, resulting in an increase in our reported revenues and costs. In addition, the majority of our debt is, and will continue to be following the Offering, denominated in euro and therefore the amount of our reported indebtedness is subject to a certain degree of currencyrelated fluctuations when translated into pounds sterling for inclusion in our financial statements at period-end exchange rates. Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. As a result of our operational structure, our exposure to currency transaction risk is relatively limited, with approximately 83% of our costs denominated in the relevant local operating currency in the 2020 financial year. Our primary transactional risk exposure comes in the form of raw material purchases by our United Kingdom and Australian operations, in which sales are predominantly denominated in pounds sterling and Australian dollars, respectively, but which have costs denominated in euro and U.S. dollars (approximately 4% and 13% for the 2020 financial year, respectively). Our Continental European ceramic tile businesses have very little transactional risk exposure. We mitigate our limited transactional risk through forward exchange contracts up to 12 months in advance to hedge our residual exposure to currencies other than the pound sterling. See ‘‘—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market _Risk—Currency Risk.’’_ Fluctuations in the value of the euro and Australian dollar relative to the pound sterling typically have a short-term impact on our gross margin as, on the revenue side, both we and our customers seek to adjust prices in response to foreign currency fluctuations. On the expense side, both we and our suppliers also seek to adjust prices. In addition, our industry is competitive and elastic, as demonstrated by price rebalancing across the industry in response to foreign currency and raw material price fluctuations. Changes in foreign exchange rates also have an impact on the competitive dynamics within our markets, in particular with respect to our UK carpet business. As the majority of carpeting in the United Kingdom is imported from competitors in Continental Europe, the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the euro increases our competitive advantage in this market. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry _and Business—Our operations require the use of several different currencies, exposing us to both transaction and translation effects of exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect our profitability, costs and ability to repay indebtedness or comply with certain maintenance covenants.’’_ The effect of a 10% strengthening of the euro against the pound sterling over the full year would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in Group post-tax loss for the 2020 financial year of £47.7 million. A 10% weakening in the euro against the pound sterling would, on the same basis, have decreased Group post-tax loss by £39.0 million. 64 ----- _Raw Materials Expenses_ Raw materials constitute the majority of our production costs. Our key raw material inputs for the 2020 financial year (other than electricity at approximately 1% of costs) were: (i) with respect to carpets, synthetic yarn (approximately 29% of costs); (ii) with respect to ceramics, clay and natural gas (approximately 14% and 9% of costs, respectively); and (iii) with respect to underlay, polyurethane foam trim (approximately 22% of costs). As supply for these inputs is relatively unconstrained, our underlying raw material expenses do not typically exhibit significant volatility. In any event, we seek to pass-through any increases in raw material prices to our customers. Additionally, we have a broad range of suppliers, with our top ten suppliers approximately constituting only 19% of our total expenditure with third parties for the 2020 financial year. In some instances, prices are fixed pursuant to long-term agreements but, more commonly, the Group purchases strategically using competitive processes. We typically review prices every six to 12 months. The primary source of volatility with respect to our raw material expenses is currency risk, primarily with respect to synthetic yarn and polyurethane foam trim, which we purchase in euro and U.S. dollars. We significantly mitigate this risk through forward exchange contracts to hedge our residual exposure to currencies other than the pound sterling. We have not experienced any material price increases or disruptions to our supply of key raw material inputs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We seek to acquire businesses that are growing and profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive advantages in production and distribution. In line with our commitment to sustainable growth, we look to a combination of equity and debt funding to acquire material businesses and to maintain leverage levels in line with our historical performance and financial policy. In November 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Keraben for total consideration of A274.1 million (£243.4 million). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1258 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. Keraben, which is based in Castell´on, Spain, designs, manufactures and distributes a range of mid- to upper-market white body and porcelain tiles for both wall and floor covering. The enlarged group, containing three brands with strong market reputation, is substantially diversified in terms of both product and geography and is an ideal platform for further potential acquisitions in the ceramic tile segment. The Group results for the 2018 financial year included contribution from Keraben of A46.8 million (£41.1 million) of revenue and A10.8 million (£9.5 million) of profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1373 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2018 financial year. Keraben’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in November 2017. In December 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Serra for initial cash consideration of A38.1 million (£33.6 million) and deferred cash consideration of up to A20.0 million (£17.7 million) payable over the next four succeeding years. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1341 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. Serra, which is based in Serramazzoni, Italy, sells and exports ceramic tiles domestically and abroad, selling to a combination of wholesalers, retail groups and independent stores throughout Continental Europe, North America and Asia. The Group results for the 2018 financial year included contribution from Serra of A6.5 million (£5.7 million) of revenue and A2.5 million (£2.2 million) of profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1373 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2018 financial year. Serra’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in December 2017. In August 2018, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Saloni, a Spanish ceramic tile business based in Castell´on, Spain, from Obinesa Grupo Industrial S.L. for cash consideration of A96.7 million (£86.2 million). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1218 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition further drives our expansion in the Continental European ceramic tile segment and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing businesses. The Group results for the 2019 financial year included contribution from Saloni of A65.2 million (£57.5 million) of revenue and A5.8 million (£5.1 million) of profit before tax. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1344 = £1.00, which was the period average 65 ----- for the 2019 financial year. Saloni’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in August 2018. In August 2019, the Group acquired the business and certain assets of Iberoalcorense, S.L.U., a Spanish ceramic tile business based in Castell´on, Spain, selling domestically and internationally to a combination of wholesalers, retail groups and independent stores throughout Continental Europe, North America and the Middle East. The Group paid initial cash consideration of A9.4 million (£8.6 million), and deferred and contingent consideration of up to A6.2 million (£5.7 million), subject to further post-closing adjustments. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.0864 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition continues our expansion in the Continental European ceramic tile segment and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing Keraben and Saloni businesses. The Group results for the 2020 financial year included contribution from Ibero of A15.3 million of revenue (£13.3 million) of revenue and A0.6 million (£0.5 million) of profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1324 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2019 financial year. Ibero’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in August 2019. In November 2019, the Group acquired the entire share capital of a small underlay distributor in Continental Europe, Estillon B.V., for a total purchase price of A5.7 million (£5.0 million) consisting of initial cash consideration of A3.2 million (£2.8 million) (the remainder comprising deferred and contingent consideration). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1593 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. The Group results for the 2020 financial year included contribution from Estillon of A4.8 million of revenue (£4.2 million) of revenue and A0.3 million (£0.3 million) of Underlying EBITDA. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1442 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2020 financial year. Estillon’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in November 2019. In March 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to lease (with the option to purchase) the entire business and manufacturing facilities of Ascot Gruppo Ceramiche S.r.l., a manufacturer of high-quality porcelain ceramic flooring in Sassuolo, Italy selling domestically and internationally to a combination of wholesalers, retail groups and independent stores throughout Continental Europe. Total consideration for the lease and accompanying option amounted to A11.5 million (£9.9 million), all of which was deferred on completion, with payments being made over the period of the seven year lease (in annual instalments) up to the point at which the option to acquire is exercised (at no additional cost), at which time the balance of the total consideration is due. The transaction further drives our expansion in the Continental European ceramic tile segment and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing Serra business. The Group maintains full control over Ascot and intends to exercise the acquisition option. The Group results for the 2020 financial year included contribution from Ascot of A4.8 million (£4.2 million) of revenue and A0.4 million (£0.3 million) of profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1442 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2020 financial year. Ascot’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in March 2020. In December 2020, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Keradom S.r.l., an Italian manufacturer of high-quality porcelain ceramic flooring in Sassuolo, Italy, consisting of initial cash consideration of A4.6 million (£4.1 million), and deferred and contingent consideration of up to A8.0 million (£7.2 million), subject to potential further performance-based post-closing adjustments. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1103 = £1.00, which was the exchange rate as of the date of the acquisition. The transaction further drives our expansion in the Continental European ceramic tile segment and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing Italian businesses. Pro forma for the acquisition, the Group results for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020 would have included contribution from Keradom of A21.1 million (£18.4 million) of revenue and A3.5 million (£3.1 million) of Underlying EBITDA. Euro amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.1442 = £1.00, which was the period average for the 2020 financial year. Keradom’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in December 2020. In January 2021, the Group acquired the business and certain assets of an English distributor of soft flooring products, Hanover Flooring Limited, for initial cash consideration of £1.0 million, deferred consideration of £12.5 million and contingent consideration of up to £11.5 million, each subject to potential further post-closing adjustments. The transaction further drives our distribution capabilities in the United Kingdom and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing businesses in the United 66 ----- Kingdom.

We expect the ultimate significance of the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on financial and operational results, will be determined by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We currently continue to operate all of our manufacturing facilities globally, and did not experience material price increases or disruptions to our supply of raw materials. We have maintained a robust liquidity position since the initial government-mandated lockdowns in March 2020 and have not accessed any government credit-line schemes. We have also been encouraged by our most recent results, as 67 ----- the initial drop in demand we experienced during the initial government-mandated lockdowns rebounded quickly and was followed by strong sales in the months of October, November and December, 2020.

UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles: Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment increased by £10.5 million, or 8.6%, to £132.5 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £122.0 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. Australia: Our revenue from Australia decreased by £2.7 million, or 5.4%, to £47.0 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £49.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. 70 ----- _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by £3.0 million, or 1.5%, to £203.2 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £200.2 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the full-period effect of our prior-period acquisition of Ibero, our acquisition of Ascot and the additional week of trading in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the prior period. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased by 3.1 percentage points from 63.4% for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, to 66.5% for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020. _Gross profit_ Gross profit decreased by £13.4 million, or 11.6%, to £102.3 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £115.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. Our gross profit margin decreased by 3.1 percentage points from 36.6% for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, to 33.5% for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020. This was due to the full-period effect of our prior-period acquisition of Ibero, our acquisition of Ascot and the additional week of trading in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the prior period. _Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_ Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £0.4 million, or 1.0%, to £39.6 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £39.2 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, primarily due to the full-period effect of our prior-period acquisition of Ibero, our acquisition of Ascot and the additional week of trading in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the prior period. Distribution costs decreased by £2.3 million, or 6.0%, to £36.0 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £38.3 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, primarily due to lower sales activity during the period, our acquisition of Ascot and the additional week of trading in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the prior period, partially off-set by lower distribution activity in the beginning of the period. In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, have, as a percentage of revenue, increased slightly at 24.7% of revenue, as compared to 24.5% of revenue for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. _Other operating income_ Other operating income remained flat at £1.5 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, as compared to £1.5 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. This income primarily relates to the sale to the local power grid of electricity generated as a byproduct of the manufacturing process from Keraben’s combined heat and power plant. _Underlying operating profit_ Underlying operating profit decreased by £11.5 million, or 29.0%, to £28.2 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £39.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. This decrease is primarily attributable to decreased revenues and increased cost of sales for the period. Our underlying operating profit margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points from 12.7% for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, to 9.2% for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020. For further information on our like-for-like performance, see ‘‘—Results of Operations—Comparison of results of operations for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019 _and the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020—Underlying EBITDA.’’ Finance costs_ Our underlying finance costs increased by £2.3 million to £14.5 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £12.2 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. This increase primarily reflects the additional interest costs resulting from the Existing Notes and an increase of £0.6 million in amounts related to the unwinding of the discount on right-of-use lease liabilities. Reported net finance costs decreased by £4.6 million to £13.7 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £18.3 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, predominantly as a result of the absence of released prepaid finance costs as compared to the prior period and lack of underwriting fees and costs relating to bank facilities incurred in the prior period. 71 ----- _Taxation_ The reported corporation tax charge decreased by £2.4 million to a tax credit of £0.8 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from a tax charge of £1.6 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. The underlying tax charge of £3.5 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, when measured against underlying profit before tax, represents an effective tax rate of 25.5%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of £6.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, and an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects a greater contribution from subsidiaries in geographies where the corporate tax rate is higher than the historical Group effective tax rate, as a result the full-period impact of our acquisition of Ibero, which is located in Spain with an applicable local corporation tax rate of 25.0%, and our acquisition of Ascot, which is located in Italy with an applicable local corporation tax rate of 27.9%. _Underlying EBITDA_ Underlying EBITDA decreased by £6.1 million, or 10.4%, to £52.4 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £58.5 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the challenging trading environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed lockdowns across the geographies in which we operate. Nevertheless, we believe our record results in the post-lockdown period reflect significant pent-up and consistent demand. Our Underlying EBITDA margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points from 18.7% for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, to 17.2% for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, which is attributable to the foregoing, notwithstanding an Underlying EBITDA margin of 20.1% in the post-lockdown period from June to September 2020. For the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we generated Underlying EBITDA of £19.2 million in our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment, £27.7 million in our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment and £6.2 million in Australia, as compared to £19.4 million, £34.4 million and £5.6 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, respectively. On a like-for-like basis and as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, our Underlying EBITDA margin: (i) increased by 150 basis points for our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment (an increase of 500 basis points in the post-lockdown period from June to September 2020 as compared to the equivalent prior-year period); (ii) decreased by 350 basis points for our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment (an increase of 150 basis points in the post-lockdown period from June to September 2020 as compared to the equivalent prior-year period); and (iii) increased by 210 basis points in Australia (an increase of 260 basis points in the post-lockdown period from June to September 2020 as compared to the equivalent prior-year period). 72 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenues attributable to our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment, partially offset by an increase in revenue generated by our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment, with our Australia segment revenues decreasing slightly. From the months of June to September of 2020, however, our revenue increased by 9.2% on a like-for-like basis, which was primarily attributable to pent-up customer demand for our products following the cessation of government-mandated lockdowns in the summer of 2020. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment decreased by 12.6% over this period, primarily due to the challenging trading environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed lockdowns in the United Kingdom which spanned from the months of March to May of 2020. Revenues, however, in the post-lockdown period from June to September were 27.8% higher than revenues in the prior equivalent period (a like-for-like increase of 21.2% as compared to the equivalent prior-year period), supporting segment results and reflecting significant pent-up and consistent demand post-lockdown. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment increased by 8.6% over this period, primarily attributable to the full-period effect of our prior-period acquisition of Ibero and our acquisition of Ascot, supported by organic sales growth in post-lockdown revenues from June to September which were 27.4% higher than revenues in the equivalent prior-year period (a like-for-like decrease of 2.6% as compared to the equivalent prior-year period), reflecting significant pent-up and consistent demand post-lockdown. Our revenue from our Australia segment decreased by 5.4% over this period notwithstanding like-for-like revenue growth of 14.7% for the post-lockdown period from June to August as compared to the equivalent prior-year period, primarily due to the continued challenging trading environment, further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed lockdowns in August and September 2020. _Revenue by operating segment_ The following table sets forth our revenue for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, and the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, by operating segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Australia: Our revenue from Australia decreased by £4.4 million, or 4.4%, to £95.6 million for the 2020 financial year from £100.0 million for the 2019 financial year. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by £30.3 million, or 8.3%, to £395.1 million for the 2020 financial year from £364.8 million for the 2019 financial year. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni, our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot and organic sales growth. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points from 64.4% for the 2019 financial year to 63.6% for the 2020 financial year. _Gross profit_ Gross profit increased by £24.4 million, or 12.1%, to £226.4 million for the 2020 financial year from £202.0 million for the 2019 financial year. Our gross profit margin increased by 0.8 percentage points from 35.6% for the 2019 financial year to 36.4% for the 2020 financial year. This was due to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni, our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot and organic sales growth. _Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_ Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £17.2 million, or 26.2%, to £82.9 million for the 2020 financial year from £65.7 million for the 2019 financial year. Distribution costs increased by £4.0 million, or 5.8%, to £73.2 million for the 2020 financial year from £69.2 million for the 2019 financial year. These increases were primarily due to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni and our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot. In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs for the 2020 financial year have, as a percentage of revenue, remained relatively consistent at 25.1% of revenue, as compared to 23.8% of revenue in the 2019 financial year. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by £0.9 million, or 29.0%, to £4.0 million for the 2020 financial year from £3.1 million for the 2019 financial year. This income primarily relates to the sale to the local power 74 ----- grid of electricity generated as a byproduct of the manufacturing process from Keraben’s combined heat and power plant. _Underlying operating profit_ Underlying operating profit increased by £4.1 million, or 5.8%, to £74.3 million for the 2020 financial year from £70.2 million for the 2019 financial year. Our underlying operating profit margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points from 12.4% for the 2019 financial year to 12.0% for the 2020 financial year. This increase is primarily attributable to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni and our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot. _Finance costs_ Our underlying finance costs increased by £13.2 million, or 100.8%, to £26.3 million for the 2020 financial year from £13.1 million for the 2019 financial year. This primarily reflects the additional interest costs resulting from the Existing Notes. Reported net finance costs increased by £29.8 million, or 107.8%, to £57.5 million for the 2020 financial year from £27.7 million for the 2019 financial year, predominantly as a result of fair value adjustments to redemption options on the Existing Notes of £7.3 million, translation differences on foreign currency indebtedness of £13.0 million and £2.6 million related to the unwinding of the discount on right-of-use lease liabilities. _Taxation_ The reported corporation tax charge remained unchanged at £4.2 million for the 2020 financial year as compared to £4.2 million for the 2019 financial year. The underlying tax charge of £12.4 million for the 2020 financial year, when measured against underlying profit before tax, represents an effective tax rate of 25.8%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of £13.9 million for the 2019 financial year and an effective tax rate of 24.3%. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects a greater contribution from subsidiaries in geographies where the corporate tax rate is higher than the historical Group effective tax rate, as a result of the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni and our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot. _Underlying EBITDA_ Underlying EBITDA increased by £22.0 million, or 22.9%, to £118.1 million for the 2020 financial year from £96.1 million for the 2019 financial year. This increase was primarily due to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni and our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot. Our Underlying EBITDA margin increased by 2.0 percentage points from 17.0% for the 2019 financial year to 19.0% for the 2020 financial year, which is partially attributable to the shift in our product mix towards ceramic tile products. 75 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

See the Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Group Financial Statements. (2) As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential future credit risk across key customer categories was reassessed as at March 28, 2020, resulting in an increase in credit loss provision of £2.8 million. See Note 14 to the 2020 Group Financial Statements. _Revenue_ During the 2020 financial year, our revenue increased by £54.7 million, or 9.7%, to £621.5 million from £566.8 million for the 2019 financial year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni, our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot and organic sales growth. 73 ----- During the 2020 financial year, our revenue increased by 0.4% on a like-for-like basis, which was primarily attributable to like-for-like revenue growth in our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segments, partially offset by a decline in by our Australia segment. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment remained flat on a like-for-like basis over this period. Our revenue from our Australia segment decreased by 1.0% on a like-for-like basis over this period, which was primarily due to the continued challenging trading environment. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment increased by 2.3% on a like-for-like basis over this period, which was primarily due to strong performance in the DIY retail segment in Continental Europe. _Revenue by operating segment_ The following table sets forth our revenue for the 2019 and 2020 financial years by operating segment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The financial information presented in this table for the 2018 financial year has been re-presented to give effect to our 2019 financial year re-segmentation. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial _Information—Operating Segment Reporting.’’_ UK & Europe—Soft Flooring: Our revenue from UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment increased by £7.9 million, or 3.0%, to £272.9 million for the 2019 financial year from £265.0 million for the 2018 financial year. UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles: Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment increased by £146.9 million, or 312.6%, to £193.9 million for the 2019 financial year from £47.0 million for the 2018 financial year. Australia: Our revenue from Australia decreased by £12.8 million, or 11.3%, to £100.0 million for the 2019 financial year from £112.8 million for the 2018 financial year. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by £85.4 million, or 30.6%, to £364.8 million for the 2019 financial year from £279.4 million for the 2018 financial year. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the acquisition of Saloni and the full-year effect of the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 1.4 percentage points from 65.8% for the 2018 financial year to 64.4% for the 2019 financial year. _Gross profit_ Gross profit increased by £56.6 million, or 38.9%, to £202.0 million for the 2019 financial year from £145.4 million for the 2018 financial year. Our gross profit margin increased by 1.4 percentage points from 34.2% for the 2018 financial year to 35.6% for the 2019 financial year. This was due to the acquisition of Saloni and the full-year effect of the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. _Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_ Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £27.1 million, or 70.2%, to £65.7 million for the 2019 financial year from £38.6 million for the 2018 financial year. Distribution costs increased by £9.8 million, or 16.5%, to £69.2 million for the 2019 financial year from £59.4 million for the 2018 financial year. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of Saloni, the full-year effect of the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs for the 2019 financial year have, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 23.8% of revenue, as compared to 23.1% of revenue in the 2018 financial year. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by £1.7 million, or 121.4%, to £3.1 million for the 2019 financial year from £1.4 million for the 2018 financial year. This income primarily relates to the sale to the local power grid of electricity generated as a byproduct of the manufacturing process from Keraben’s combined heat and power plant. 77 ----- _Underlying operating profit_ Underlying operating profit increased by £21.4 million, or 43.9%, to £70.2 million for the 2019 financial year from £48.8 million for the 2018 financial year. Our underlying operating profit margin increased by 0.9 percentage points from 11.5% for the 2018 financial year to 12.4% for the 2019 financial year. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Saloni and the full-year effect of the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. _Finance costs_ Our underlying finance costs increased by £5.1 million, or 63.8%, to £13.1 million for the 2019 financial year from £8.0 million for the 2018 financial year. This reflects the additional interest costs resulting from the acquisition of Saloni and the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Reported net finance costs increased by £14.7 million, or 113.1%, to £27.7 million for the 2019 financial year from £13.0 million for the 2018 financial year, predominantly as a result of fair value adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration of £7.2 million and translation differences of £3.6 million. _Taxation_ The reported corporation tax charge decreased by £0.6 million, or 12.5%, to £4.2 million for the 2019 financial year from £4.8 million for the 2018 financial year. The underlying tax charge of £13.9 million for the 2019 financial year, when measured against underlying profit before tax, represents an effective tax rate of 24.3%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of £9.2 million for the 2018 financial year and an effective tax rate of 22.5%. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects a greater contribution from subsidiaries in geographies where the corporate tax rate is higher than the historical Group effective tax rate, as a result of the acquisition of Saloni and the full-year impact of our acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. _Underlying EBITDA_ Underlying EBITDA increased by £31.4 million, or 48.5%, to £96.1 million for the 2019 financial year from £64.7 million for the 2018 financial year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Saloni and the full-year effect of the prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Our Underlying EBITDA margin increased by 1.8 percentage points from 15.2% for the 2018 financial year to 17.0% for the 2019 financial year, which is partially attributable to the shift in our product mix towards ceramic tile products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The increase in revenue was primarily due to our acquisition of Saloni and the full-year effect of our prior year acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. During the 2019 financial year, our revenue increased by 2.0% on a like-for-like basis, which was primarily attributable to strong revenue growth in our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment, partially offset by a decline in revenue generated by our Australia segment and a slight decline in our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Soft Flooring segment increased by 7.3% on a like-for-like basis over this period, which was primarily the result of the successful re-balancing of our soft flooring product portfolio to take into account recent demand for slightly lower-priced products on average. Our revenue from our Australia segment decreased by 6.9% on a like-for-like basis over this period, which was primarily due to the more challenging trading environment and the impact of tighter mortgage lending caps put in place by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in 2017, which ended in 2019. Our revenue from our UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles segment decreased slightly by 1.3% on a like-for-like basis over this period, which was primarily due to the impact of a one-off disruption in Serra’s production due to the installation of a new porcelain production line (completed in June 2018) and some pricing pressure on the small amount of products we export to customers outside of the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. 76 ----- _Revenue by operating segment_ The following table sets forth our revenue for the 2018 and 2019 financial years by operating segment. Prior to the 2019 financial year, we presented our soft flooring and hard flooring operating businesses in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe as a single operating segment (‘‘UK & Europe’’). To facilitate comparability of our operating segments, we have re-presented certain financial information presented for the 2018 financial year in the chart below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.34,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.34.1,Capital Resources,"Our primary sources of liquidity for the periods presented have primarily been our loan facility agreements, cash flows from operations, retained earnings and the Existing Notes. The principal financing arrangements that will be in place following the Offering will consist of the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the BGF Loan, as described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements.’’ On the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering (i) for general corporate_ purposes which may include, without limitation, the funding of one or more acquisitions and/or the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of the Issuer, (ii) to complete the Refinancing, including the payment of accrued and unpaid interest and Redemption and Tender Offer premia and (iii) to pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’ Following the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom, our debt service obligations will consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes, interest payments on the Existing Notes, principal and interest payments on amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, the BGF Loan and any capital lease obligations. As of October 3, 2020, on a _pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the Post-Balance Sheet Transactions, we would have had net senior debt on a consolidated basis of £301.7 million (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to 78 ----- fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flow from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and the cost of our current and future debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our _Structure—We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations.

This decrease was primarily due to decreased operating profits as a result of decreased revenues caused by the challenging COVID-19 trading environment during the governmentimposed lockdowns throughout the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, which required the shutdown of our production facilities in the United Kingdom and certain of our customers’ businesses until May 2020. Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £9.3 million to a net inflow of £28.6 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from a net inflow of £37.9 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, primarily due to the increase in interest paid on loans and notes from £5.6 million in the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019 to £16.1 million in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020. Operating cash flow before interest, tax and exceptional items decreased by £1.1 million to £43.6 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, from £44.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019.

Net cash flow generated by operating activities increased by £34.1 million to a net inflow of £108.7 million for the 2020 financial year from a net inflow of £74.6 million for the 2019 financial year. This increase was primarily due to increases in operating profits as a result of the full-year effect of our prior-year acquisition of Saloni and our acquisitions of Ibero and Ascot. Operating cash flow before interest, tax and exceptional items decreased by £8.1 million to £97.6 million for the 2020 financial year from £105.7 million for the 2019 financial year.

The decrease was primarily due to the cash consideration paid in connection with our acquisition of Saloni being greater than the cash consideration paid in connection with our acquisitions of Ibero, Ascot and Estillon. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by £183.3 million to a net outflow of £133.0 million for the 2019 financial year from a net outflow of £316.3 million for the 2018 financial year.

In the 2019 financial year, we issued share capital of £59.3 million relating to the acquisition of Saloni in the period and further repaid a reverse factoring facility acquired as part of the acquisition in an amount of £13.4 million. Net cash generated by financing activities decreased by £217.8 million to £88.8 million for the 2019 financial year from £306.6 million for the 2018 financial year.

As much of our plant and machinery is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a modular basis, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are minimal. While our maintenance capital expenditures have increased over the period under review, as our business has grown, our maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue have remained relatively stable, at 3.3%, 4.1% and 4.1% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. Our expansionary capital expenditures are primarily related to our initiatives to expand and improve our manufacturing and logistics capabilities in order to meet the needs of our growing business. Our capital expenditures during the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 were £11.3 million compared to £17.6 million during the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019. Our capital expenditures during the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 comprised: £9.1 million in maintenance capital expenditures and £2.2 million in expansionary capital expenditures, as compared to £12.3 million and £5.3 million in the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, respectively. Our capital expenditures during the 2020 financial year were £33.8 million compared to £44.4 million during the 2019 financial year, comprising of £25.4 million in maintenance capital expenditures and £8.4 million in expansionary capital expenditures. The decrease in our capital expenditures in the 2020 financial year as compared to the 2019 financial year was primarily attributable to decreased expansionary capital expenditures as compared to the prior year (further described in the paragraph below). Our capital expenditures during the 2019 financial year were £44.4 million compared to £29.3 million during the 2018 financial year, comprising of £23.5 million in maintenance capital expenditures and £20.9 million in expansionary capital expenditures. The increase in our capital expenditures in the 2019 financial year as compared to the 2018 financial year was primarily attributable to: (i) the addition of Keraben’s new clay atomizers in floor and wall plants in order to increase clay reception capacity, (ii) Keraben’s new inkjet printing machines for wall and floor pressing and glazing processes, (iii) the installation of a state-of-the-art finishing line in the South Wales factory, (iv) ongoing logistics optimization projects and (v) investments to increase our manufacturing capacity in our Abingdon, Quest and Keraben businesses. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Our exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to our trade receivables. Credit risk is managed locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are obtained from reputable external sources. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction on the recoverability of the cash flows. Furthermore, in specific areas where a heightened credit risk is perceived, credit insurance is utilized to help mitigate this risk. A review of credit risk by customer category was undertaken in light of historical rates of credit loss overlaid with the heightened risk of potential economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical locations. Furthermore, specific trade receivables are written-off when there is considered to be little likelihood of recovering the debt. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s credit loss provision was increased by £1.0 million in the 2020 financial year to account for heightened risk. We continue to monitor our exposure to expected credit losses and further disclosure will be provided in future periods if the our assessment changes. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies. We have no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. The Issuer has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the performances of which are closely monitored. Further, the carrying amounts of monies owed by the Issuer’s subsidiaries are approximate to their fair value. 82 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. Our policy is to ensure that we always have sufficient cash to allow us to meet our liabilities when they become due. To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days. The board of directors of the Issuer (the ‘‘Board’’) monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts against actual cash position on a monthly basis. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a detailed exercise was undertaken to understand the cash consumption of the business through a range of possible outcomes, including impacts on profit/loss and working capital requirements.

The Group borrows in the desired currency at floating or fixed rates of interest and may then use interest rate swaps to secure the desired interest profile and manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations. After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we anticipate that only the amounts that we borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to variable interest rates, as the Notes will carry interest at a fixed rate. The annualized effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in post-tax loss for the year of £0.2 million for the 2020 financial year (2019: increase in post-tax profit of £0.4 million).

It is the Board’s policy not to hedge against translational risk-resulting movements in the pound sterling/Australian dollar and pound sterling/ euro exchange rates. Other currency exposure derives from trading operations where goods are exported or raw materials and capital equipment are imported.

The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. We are required on an annual basis to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill balances is less than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty rates and customer attrition.

Details of the option embedded in the contract are shown in Note 16 to the 2020 Group Financial Statements. In assessing the applicable recognition date for the embedded derivative, it was deemed appropriate to apply the loan commitment scope exclusion as defined in the standard. Consequently, the date of initial recognition was considered to be the date of drawdown, as opposed to the date of commitment. As a result of applying the loan commitment scope exclusion, as above, it was deemed appropriate to base the value of the combined instrument on the proceeds as agreed at the earlier commitment date. It was deemed appropriate that for the purpose of calculating the host as the residual that, in light of the loan commitment scope exclusion applied, the embedded option should only be recognised on drawdown and therefore that its initial carrying value should be the fair value at that date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.1,Global Market Overview,521.1.1,,"_By product_ There are a number of products that comprise the global flooring industry. The two major product segments are: hard flooring, which is composed of non-resilient flooring and resilient flooring, and soft flooring, which is also known as carpets and rugs. Global demand for flooring includes both hard flooring and soft flooring (collectively, ‘‘Global Flooring Demand’’). Non-resilient flooring includes ceramic tiles, laminate and wood flooring, as well as other miscellaneous items such as bamboo, glass, plastic and grating. Relative to other flooring products, non-resilient flooring benefits from durability and ease of maintenance. In 2017, non-resilient flooring accounted for approximately 58.1% of flooring demand (Source: Freedonia Report). The non-resilient flooring segment is forecast to grow at an expected compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of 3.1% between 2017 and 2022 (Source: Freedonia Report). Resilient flooring products mainly consist of vinyl but also include asphalt, cork, linoleum and rubber. Resilient flooring products are relatively lower in cost compared to other flooring products and benefit from high underfoot comfort, noise absorption, durability and wear resistance. Also included in this category are LVT, which have been gaining popularity in recent years with demand expected to continue to increase. Resilient flooring is expected to be the fastest growing segment with a CAGR of 3.9% in the period from 2017 to 2022 (Source: Freedonia Report). Soft flooring products are textile floor coverings. These products range from braided, hooked and needlepunched products, as well as tufted products such as broadloom carpeting, scatter rugs, bath mats and artificial grass. In contrast to the other types of flooring, soft flooring is expected to show more modest growth over the 2017 to 2022 period, with a forecast CAGR of 2.4% (Source: Freedonia Report). Tufted products constitute the vast majority of this segment, and their lower cost and improving product performance are expected to contribute to demand growth for tufted products. _By region_ The level of economic growth has an impact on Global Flooring Demand. Global real gross domestic product (‘‘GDP’’) is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% from 2017 through to 2022, with the Asia/Pacific region expected to experience the highest growth rate over the forecast period (Source: Freedonia Report). The forecasted global real GDP growth rate is slightly higher than the global real GDP growth 87 ----- rate experienced for the 2012 to 2017 period. The following chart shows GDP by region for 2012 through to the forecasted GDP for 2022. 20FEB202101404645 Source: Freedonia Report Global Flooring Demand is forecasted to reach 21.0 billion square meters (‘‘m[2]’’) with a valuation of approximately $226.0 billion by 2022 (Source: Freedonia Report). This represents a CAGR of 3.1% from 2017 to 2022 (Source: Freedonia Report). The Asia/Pacific region and the Africa/Mideast region are projected to contribute to most of this growth, as personal income for individuals in developing countries in these regions is expected to grow. Growing personal income in these areas is also expected to translate into increased demand for flooring products as an alternative to traditional unimproved floor surfaces. Our largest markets are Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Western European region is projected to record a CAGR of 1.3% over the 2017 to 2022 period (Source: Freedonia Report). The United Kingdom is expected to have a similar growth profile over the same period, with demand also forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 1.1% (Source: Freedonia Report). Demand in Australia, where soft flooring dominates the market, is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 0.8% over the 2017 to 2022 period (Source: Freedonia Report). _By end-market_ Flooring has three predominant end-markets: (i) residential buildings, (ii) non-residential buildings and (iii) transportation equipment and other uses. The residential buildings end-market encompasses single-family homes, multi-family structures (for example, apartments) and manufactured housing. This end-market can be further segmented into (i) new construction (i.e. the building of new structures) end-market (3.0 billion m[2] of demand as of 2017) and (ii) improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market (6.4 billion m[2] of demand as of 2017). The I&R end-market constitutes the majority of the market. The non-residential buildings end-market includes office, retail, institutional, industrial, and other business / government facilities. Like the residential buildings end-market, flooring in this end-market can also be further segmented into new construction and I&R. The new construction end-market is smaller relative to the I&R end-market, both globally and in Western Europe. The transportation equipment and other uses end-market consists of a variety of vehicle types (for example, automobiles and boats) and other miscellaneous applications such as power plant control rooms and water treatment facilities. Nearly all of the transportation related flooring products are installed at the OEM level an remain throughout the vehicle’s life, unless it is refurbished. 88 20FEB202101404645 ----- The primary driver of Global Flooring Demand is construction activity, which includes new construction and I&R. Economic and demographic factors have an impact on the level of construction activity. For example, residential construction expenditure is influenced by real interest rates, population growth, employment rates and personal income. On the other hand, non-residential construction expenditure is impacted by the general business cycle and the supply of buildings within a particular area. Additionally, higher income countries (such as Australia, the United States and Japan) typically have well-developed building construction and/or transportation equipment manufacturing sectors, making new construction and renovations more affordable for their respective populations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

We believe that we do not have any directly comparable competitors due to our diverse product offering within our core markets in Europe and Australia. In our view, the industry landscape within which Victoria operates can be broadly divided into three competitor market segments, namely, soft flooring specialists, ceramic tile specialists, and large multi-class producers. Within the soft flooring specialists segment, Balta, Condor Carpets and Associated Weavers are some of the key, larger players with a strong presence in Europe. However, these companies do not have any offering within resilient or non-resilient hard flooring. Furthermore, whilst all of these companies export to the UK market, which is both the largest broadloom carpet market within Europe and our primary focus within this segment, they do not have comparably broad distribution capabilities and are more reliant than Victoria on local wholesalers and larger national retailers. Within the ceramic tile specialists segment, Porcelanosa, Pamesa Ceramica and Baldocer, each based in Spain, and Florim and Marazzi (the latter owned by Mohawk), based in Italy, are examples of key competitors. However, none of these companies have resilient hard flooring or soft flooring product offerings. In terms of large multi-class producers, Tarkett, Forbo and Beaulieu International (Flooring Solutions division) are the main players within Europe. Tarkett and Forbo are predominantly focused on the manufacture and distribution of resilient hard flooring products (where Victoria currently has a smaller, selective presence) as well as products for commercial end-markets.

The United Kingdom is Western Europe’s second largest economy and is a key regional financial hub. In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union and on March 29, 2017, the Government formally initiated the withdrawal process for the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’). A withdrawal agreement, setting out the terms of the withdrawal, was approved by the United Kingdom Parliament on January 9, 2020, and on December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally completed its exit from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on 92 ----- the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. To date, the potential effects of Brexit on foreign trade and investment remain unclear. GDP growth is forecasted to slow, increasing at 1.6% annually up to 2022 (Source: Freedonia Report). The residential renovation market has proven to be resilient in the months since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers are spending more time at home and re-focusing discretionary expenditures away from travel and leisure. Household savings, particularly in higher-income households (which represent our target demographic), have increased during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment increases have primarily affected younger workers, who are less likely to own their own homes. According to Rightmove, home sales in the United Kingdom were 70% higher in September 2020 than they were in September 2019, and management expects these increased sales to have a positive effect on home improvement expenditures in the medium term.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.6,BUSINESS Overview,521.6.1,,"We are a leading international designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. In each of our product segments, we have leading market positions in the markets in which we operate. We are a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. In soft flooring, we are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We manufacture and supply a diversified range of products, including carpet, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, luxury vinyl tile (‘‘LVT’’), artificial grass and flooring accessories. The majority of our products are for residential use, with a particular focus on the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market. We primarily target mid- to upper-market product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche product segments. Our customer base is diverse and focused on small, independent retailers with whom we can differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering superior service. We group our reported operating segments by product category and manufacturing geography. These segments, broadly divided into ceramic tile and soft flooring offerings, comprise: (i) UK & Europe— Ceramic Tiles, consisting of our ceramic tile manufacturing businesses in Spain and Italy; (ii) UK & Europe—Soft Flooring, consisting predominantly of our carpet, flooring underlay, artificial grass, LVT and flooring accessories businesses in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe; and (iii) Australia, consisting of our (predominantly carpet and flooring underlay) soft flooring businesses in Australia. In the 2020 financial year, ceramic tile accounted for 61.3% of our Underlying EBITDA, with soft flooring and other products accounting for the remaining 37.6% of our Underlying EBITDA (in both cases, excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). For the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, we generated £673.5 million of _Pro Forma Revenue and £120.4 million of Pro Forma EBITDA (17.9% Pro Forma EBITDA margin). While we have grown largely through strategic acquisitions since 2013, like-for-like revenue growth was 1.6%, 2.0% and 0.4% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. Our revenue and Underlying EBITDA is diversified across a variety of products and geographies. Through a series of strategic acquisitions, we have developed a balanced operating model across ceramic tiles and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products, both in terms of product category and target price point. Although originally focused on soft flooring offerings, we have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. In particular, our Keraben, Serra, Saloni and Ibero businesses, together with our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, give us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic exposure. The following charts set forth our Underlying EBITDA by destination geography and product segment for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). 20FEB202101404069 (1) Geographic split is based on Underlying EBITDA split by destination. (2) This split assumes a consistent margin on sales across all geographies and for each business unit. (3) Includes small amounts attributable to LVT and other products. 100 20FEB202101404069 ----- We have gained scale in the large and fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a major competitor in both the soft and hard flooring markets. To build on the competitive advantage of our soft flooring capabilities, we expanded into the complementary flooring underlay market by adding flooring underlay operations in both the United Kingdom and Australia in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This was achieved through the acquisitions of Interfloor in 2015 and Ezi Floor in 2016, flooring underlay manufacturers based in the United Kingdom, and the 2016 acquisition of Dunlop, a flooring underlay manufacturer based in Australia. In response to robust growth in demand for artificial grass, we further expanded into the artificial grass market through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands in 2017. We entered the ceramic tile segment in Continental Europe through our acquisitions of Serra (Italy) and Keraben (Spain) in 2017, Saloni (Spain) in 2018, Ibero (Spain) in 2019 and Ascot (Italy) and Keradom (Italy) in 2020. These strategic acquisitions have given us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic footprint. In 2019, we also made the small acquisition of Estillon B.V., a small underlay distributor in Continental Europe, and further added to our soft flooring distribution offering in the United Kingdom with our acquisition of Hanover in January 2021. We believe we have achieved an optimal level of integration with respect to our recent strategic acquisitions, enabling us to develop a balanced operating model across ceramic and soft flooring, offering a diversified product portfolio of flooring products. We have a highly successful multi-brand strategy with over 30 brands encompassing mid- to upper-priced products. These include 14 carpet brands covering a broad range of wool and synthetic products, such as Victoria, Whitestone Weavers, StainFree and Quest; Westex and Hugh Mackay, two of our premium carpet brands; Duralay, Dunlop and Tredaire, leading and innovative flooring underlay brands; Keraben and Saloni, mid- to upper-market ceramic tile brands; Distinctive, Heartridge and Frontier, under which we sell high-end LVT products; and GrassInc and Avalon, under which we sell artificial grass products for a wide range of applications, including lawns, parks, sports grounds and indoor applications. We benefit from economies of scale through our consolidated manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our business is selectively vertically integrated, comprising three components: (i) the design and specification of the majority of our products; (ii) the manufacturing of the substantial majority of our products, with limited outsourcing in circumstances in which doing so is financially and operationally beneficial; and (iii) the distribution of our products based on their product category and customer proposition, which maximizes the turnover of our inventory and product efficiency. We believe that this balanced approach to vertical integration creates robust margins and increases our competitive advantage in our target markets. We believe we have competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate, including our design capabilities, large-scale and efficient in-house manufacturing facilities and our long-standing direct relationships with retailers across all operating businesses. We operate fourteen manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and three manufacturing sites in Australia. Our integrated in-house capabilities allow us to operate our production facilities flexibly, varying production levels to meet demand, while maintaining a low fixed cost base, high efficiency and rigorous quality control. Where advantageous to do so, we have consolidated the design, manufacturing and distribution of certain products. Our core markets are the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, where we employ over 3,400 people across more than 20 sites. The largest end-market for our products is the improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market, and, therefore, our business is less exposed to the economic cycles that otherwise commonly affect the smaller, cyclical construction end-market. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical segments in which they are manufactured, placing us in close proximity to our customer bases across core markets. Our relationships with our customers, the thousands of flooring retailers and small number of distributors and direct sales customers we supply across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are central to our success. We primarily sell directly to retailers. In the United Kingdom, our 3,000-plus customers range from independent retailers to distributors and large format chains. Some of these relationships, across operating geographies, are multigenerational and we believe the strength and depth of these relationships represent a significant competitive advantage. When coupled with our expansion since 2013, these relationships allow us to offer a broad range of products to our customers and further our cross-selling opportunities. We benefit from a large, diverse customer base with limited concentration. For the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of our revenue. 101 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Competitive Strengths,521.7.1,Market-leading business with a focus on branded mid- to high-end products,"We have built a market-leading business across our core markets with a wide product range and global production and distribution capabilities. We are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, with approximately 14% market share, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia, with approximately 14% market share, and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both jurisdictions, in each case by volume as of March 28, 2020. We are also a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer in the mid- to upper-market ceramic tile segment by volume, with approximately 8% market share as of March 28, 2020. Our focus on upper-market products across the majority of our product segments is driven by the stronger and more resilient margins they generate as compared to lower-end flooring products. Upper-market product sales are generally less volatile than sales in the lower-end market, as end-consumers in the uppermarket generally have more stable spending habits; unlike many products in the lower-end market, mid- to high-end products also benefit from brand recognition, especially among retailers and wholesalers who are able to differentiate on the basis of brand quality and brand customer service. We believe that our market-leading positions across our key end-markets, together with our wide product range and our global distribution capabilities allow us to closely track and adapt to customer behavior while adjusting our production levels to match demand. Specifically, as a result of our presence in multiple product segments, our vertical integration and significant contacts across retailers, we are able to receive substantial feedback as to end-consumer trends in design and supply volumes on a timely basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Competitive Strengths,521.7.2,"Diversified business across products, geographies and customers","We have a diverse product portfolio consisting of wool and synthetic broadloom carpets, ceramic tiles, laminate, flooring underlay, LVT and other hardwood flooring products, artificial grass, carpet tiles and flooring accessories. These products are spread across over 30 brands. Notably, while we have sought to selectively expand our product portfolio, we have strategically elected not to enter into product markets characterized by low margins and high price competition, such as linoleum. We primarily target the mid- to upper markets and employ a commercially focused product development process to proactively manage our margins. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes inform one another and are designed to yield product specifications that align with our target customers’ price points while optimizing margins. Our customer relationships and manufacturing flexibility also aid diversification of our product portfolio. Our close relationships with our customers provide us with valuable feedback and enable us to adapt to changes in end-customer preferences. We are also able to avoid large-scale product warehousing because of our ability to rapidly scale production on short notice, allowing us to maintain lean inventory levels which further aid product diversification. The evolution of our product range has been targeted and deliberate, underpinned by selective acquisitions through which we have increased production flexibility and our product and geographical diversification. As a result of this careful expansion, we are not overly dependent on any particular product segment, with ceramic tile products, carpet products (including flooring underlay and accessories) and artificial grass constituting 61.3%, 34.4% and 4.3% of our Underlying EBITDA for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases), respectively. Additionally, we are not unduly dependent on any particular brand (with Keraben constituting the largest proportion of our revenues in the 2020 financial year at 19.6%) or geographical segment and have the flexibility to produce and serve multiple geographies and shift production as needed based on fluctuations in demand. In the 2020 financial year, 70.5% of our Underlying EBITDA by product destination (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases) was generated outside of the United Kingdom. Importantly, we have benefited from our diversity across geographies and customers during the SARSCoV-2 (‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic, as we were able to maintain relatively stable sales for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2020, notwithstanding governmentmandated lockdowns and restrictions in any single country. The chart below sets forth our Underlying EBITDA by product destination for the 2020 financial year (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). 102 ----- 20FEB202101405212 Through our portfolio of over 30 brands, we offer a broad, differentiated and continuously evolving product portfolio for a variety of end-markets, including residential, office and hospitality and leisure. The breadth of these offerings provide us with a diverse customer base consisting of independent retailers, national retailers, Do-It-Yourself (‘‘DIY’’) retailers and buying groups, with over 3,000 customers in the United Kingdom, over 2,000 customers in Continental Europe and approximately 800 customers in Australia. These retailers are highly diversified across specialist, non-specialist, general and DIY sales channels. The chart below sets forth our customer distribution by sales channel (as a proportion of revenue) through the 2020 financial year. 20FEB202101404788 Significantly, the vast majority of our products are sold directly to independent flooring retailers rather than third-party distributors, which we believe drives brand loyalty and long-term relationships. Our involvement in the supply chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold directly to consumers, optimizing margins. Unlike some of our competitors, a minority of our revenue is generated from large retail chains. In the 2020 financial year, 43.8% of our revenue was generated from sales to independent retailers (including DIY retailers) while 22.8% was generated from sales to large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2020 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer constituting approximately 3% of our revenue. We believe that the breadth of our product offering and the diversity of our revenue streams support the resilience of our business and that our sales of products across a number of attractive flooring segments increases our cross-selling opportunities, visibility and pricing power. We further believe that our broad product offering, expansive geographic footprint and diverse base of customers strengthen our position as a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products while positioning us for future growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Competitive Strengths,521.7.3,Stable flooring market dominated by the less cyclical improvement and repair end-market,"The United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring markets are stable, mature and attractive end-markets. According to the Freedonia Report, the flooring industries in our core markets, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are forecast to grow at a combined compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of 1.3% between 2017 and 2022, with the I&R end-market forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.4% over the same period. We believe that our rapid and successful expansion into the hard flooring market in Continental Europe, as well as our sizeable presence in Australia supported by our current optimization initiatives, collectively enable us to defend our position and take advantage of sustained demand for flooring products in the markets in which we operate. 103 20FEB202101404788 ----- In addition to the stable forecast for the flooring industry generally, our business benefits specifically from our focus on the I&R end-market. The I&R end-market in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is approximately five to six times larger than the new construction end-market and has limited dependence on new construction activity. Demand for new flooring in the new construction end-market tends to lag overall growth in new construction and is typically more volatile than the I&R end-market due to the cyclical nature of new construction activity. Conversely, the I&R end-market, which is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to upgrade the appearance of existing homes, is characterized by greater price inelasticity and is typically less susceptible to business cycles, and, according to EUROCONSTRUCT, the residential renovation industry across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is expected to remain consistent and stable to 2023. Based on the composition of our customer base, we believe that over 90% of our revenues are generated from the I&R end-market. Notably, we have benefited, and continue to benefit from increased global demand for home decoration and renovation materials from consumers who are spending increasing amounts of time at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even in countries which have implemented stringent COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures, home renovation activity has continued, helping us maintain sales in such markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Competitive Strengths,521.7.4,Established market position in an industry with high barriers to entry,"Over the course of our operating history, we have developed sufficient scale, expertise and breadth of product offering to succeed notwithstanding the significant barriers to entry in the flooring industry. We believe this business model would be difficult to replicate due to the following structural barriers to entry: - **Fragmented customer base: Our broad customer base is dominated by independent retailers, with whom we enjoy long-standing and, we believe, mutually beneficial relationships; - **Proximity to customers: Carpets are large, non-palletized goods and ceramic tiles are heavy, making both products difficult and expensive to transport. High transportation costs provide a barrier to low-cost international manufacturers from distributing their products within our geographical segments. Our operating businesses manufacture their products in close proximity to their customers and end-users, allowing us to minimize logistical costs; - **Difficulty in contract manufacturing: Long production runs are required in our industry in order to enable cost-effective manufacturing. As a result, contract manufacturing is generally not a feasible alternative to the owned production capabilities, which has been our approach; - **Strength of brands: We have a diverse portfolio of over 30 brands that we believe enjoy strong recognition with customers. New competitors in the mid- to upper-markets in which we operate would need to develop (organically or via costly acquisition) significant brand recognition in order to compete on a material level; - **Capital barriers: New entrants seeking to establish operations locally would face significant up-front capital costs; and - **Product understanding and technical know-how: We have been in continuous operation since 1895, currently employing 18 managing directors with an average of 20 years of industry expertise. Our ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure ensures that these expert local managers and their respective management teams exercise valuable discretion over the diverse products, customers and geographic markets with which they are intimately familiar, in conjunction with our highly-experienced group-level management team. We believe these barriers to entry protect our business from both the threat of inexpensive, international imports as well as new entrants to our local markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.7,Our Competitive Strengths,521.7.5,"Low operational gearing through a flexible cost base, concerted efficiency-driving efforts and low capital expenditure requirements","We benefit from low operational gearing, with 52.3% of our cost base (which represented 43.3% our revenues) for the 2020 financial year varying directly with revenue. A further 35.5% of our cost base (which represented 29.4% of our revenues) for the 2020 financial year is semi-variable, with the ability to adapt within a few months. We have been able to maintain this low operational gearing despite being a manufacturing business by automating certain processes and because our equipment generally has a very long useful life. We also benefit from multiple production sites with the flexibility, capacity and cost structure to vary production levels, enabling our business to maintain efficiency in favorable markets and 104 ----- resilience through the more challenging parts of the business cycle. Our low operational gearing has been an asset during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we are able to decrease our variable costs to partially off-set reductions in revenue that may occur during government-mandated lockdowns. The following diagram sets forth the components of our cost base for the 2020 financial year, expressed in percentage of revenues, as a function of variability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Our focus on the less cyclical I&R end-market made us less susceptible to the worst effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, and we successfully increased our revenue in each of 2006-2011. We also gained invaluable experience from this period, during which time consumers opted for less expensive forms of home improvement. While we shifted our sales mix to lower than average selling prices in order to protect sales volumes, we were able to utilize our flexible cost base to maintain our margins. After the global financial crisis, we expanded our product portfolio, developed a more efficient production footprint and introduced optimized inventory management. Our business is fundamentally broader and more diversified than it was at the beginning of the global financial crisis, as we have shifted from a pure carpeting business to a hard and soft flooring group over the 105 ----- past decade, with a range of carpet, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, LVT and artificial grass products. As a result of our increased scale through acquisitions and various operational initiatives, we optimized our production footprint and inventory management. We believe that these changes strengthened our business, especially as we also diversified geographically in both manufacturing and sales without over-exposure to any single geographic market. Since the change in our management in 2012, we have experienced a period of accelerated growth coupled with improvements in Underlying EBITDA margins, increasing from 7.2% in the 52 weeks ended March 29, 2014 (the ‘‘2014 financial year’’) to 18.3% in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. Further, we have maintained consistently high Operating Cash Flow Conversion, with Operating Cash Flow Conversion of 83.2% in the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020, and 85.0%, 110.0% and 99.4% in the 2020, 2019 and 2018 financial years, respectively. This strong free cash flow generation has historically allowed us to de-lever following new acquisitions, supported by relatively limited working capital requirements and stable capital expenditures that have grown in proportion to the growth in our business since 2014. We believe our prior experience and success in dealing with major economic downturns, aided by our experienced management teams across our operating businesses, has left us well-positioned to deal with the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our emphasis on operational agility, highlighted by our diversity in products and sales geographies, low operational gearing and our ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure, permits us to quickly adapt to dynamic local conditions, COVID-19 developments and idiosyncratic government responses to the pandemic. Among other advantages, we are able to change our sales mix, reduce variable costs and shift production capabilities all on short notice, all of which have allowed us to minimize the impact of the global pandemic. We believe we have robustly exhibited the resilience of our business for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, generating revenues of £305.5 million and Underlying EBITDA of £52.4 million for the 27 weeks ended October 3, 2020 (£315.9 million and £58.5 million for the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, respectively).",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Though we aim to maximize the realization of synergies following an acquisition, our strategy is primarily focused on acquiring high-quality, high-margin targets that we intend to operate as stand-alone propositions. We seek to acquire businesses that are growing and profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive advantages in production and distribution. Our acquisition targets generally possess sustainable above-average margins and are led by committed and capable management teams. We believe this focus on stand-alone business value allows us to minimize our downside acquisition risk while maintaining room for synergistic upside potential. Since the change in Group management in 2013, we have made 18 acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Keraben and Serra in 2017, Saloni in 2018, Ibero and Estillon in 2019, Ascot and Keradom in 2020 and Hanover in 2021. Over this period, our Underlying EBITDA has grown from £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to £111.9 million in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020, and our Pro Forma EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020 was £120.4 million. Our increased scale through acquisitions has given us significant opportunities for margin improvement. We possess better buying power for raw materials and have consolidated our manufacturing, distribution, warehousing and logistics capacity. Additionally, the acquisition of production capacity and development of distribution facilities in close proximity to our clients is also a competitive advantage, as the high levels of customer dispersion typical in the flooring industry can generate substantial distribution costs. Our strategically located distribution facilities allow us to minimize these costs and access customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Through our increased scale, we have also been able to rationalize product lines, improve working capital management through SKU reduction and take advantage of cross-selling products through new distribution channels. As a result of the above, our acquisition strategy has resulted in realized margin synergies, as evidenced by the increase in our Underlying EBITDA margin from 3.3% in the 2013 financial year to 18.3% in the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. We have a long history of creativity and innovation in the flooring industry, both technical and aesthetic, and we are well-positioned to develop, together with our customers, design concepts and create innovative products that are tailored to consumers’ tastes and preferences. Our strategic acquisitions in the ceramic tile and artificial grass segments position us to continue to offer products tailored to a contemporary audience. In particular, our Keraben, Serra, Saloni and Ibero businesses, together with our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom, give us a market-leading position in the higher-margin Continental 106 ----- European ceramic tile business, while diversifying our product offering and geographic exposure. We continue to introduce new product collections every year to meet consumer preferences and trends.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Geoffrey Wilding, responsible for our rapid and successful expansion, joined the Group as Executive Chairman in 2012 and drives overall Group strategy. The 2020 financial year was Philippe Hamers’ third full year as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hamers has over 25 years of experience in the flooring industry, most recently chairing Europe’s largest carpet manufacturing operation before assuming his role with us. We operate a ‘‘team-of-teams’’ structure that minimizes cost friction and red tape, while capitalizing on local expertise and allowing organic local strategies to flourish. Our international operating strategy is generated centrally by Group-level management, including budgeting, capital expenditure planning and cross-business operations. Complementing our Group-level strategy, we maintain a decentralized structure with managing directors responsible for the day-to-day management of each of our core operating businesses. Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each managing director develops their own strategy and tactics (reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets. This structure has also been an asset to us during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the managing directors of our core operating businesses and their management teams were able to react quickly and decisively when lockdowns were announced across our operating geographies. As our managing directors have an average of 20 years of industry expertise, many have been through a number of recessions over their careers, and we have been able to leverage this experience to adapt positively to rapidly changing conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our management team has a strong track record of identifying value-accretive acquisition targets, integrating the acquired companies and identifying and achieving synergies. In selectively growing our operations, we look for mature businesses with modern, well-invested production facilities, committed management teams, established distribution channels and competitive advantages in the relevant target market. Once a business has been acquired, we have historically been able to deliver significant production and purchasing synergies, which continue to drive growth in operating margins and improved like-for-like performance, as evidenced by five consecutive years of increasing EBITDA margins. An important part of our acquisition strategy is our focus on retaining the management teams at the operating companies we acquire, which is a strategy that has proved successful for the Group. We have retained nearly all members of management in post-acquisition earn-out periods and, out of the 18 acquisitions made by the Group since 2013, ten are either post earn-out or did not have an earn-out period. In addition, our divisional management teams have extensive experience in the flooring industry and we believe that their collective industry knowledge, technical expertise, and customer and supplier relationships will enable them to continue to grow our business and execute our strategies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Further, as much of our plant and equipment is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a modular basis, our business requires a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash flows. Of our capital expenditures for the 2020 financial year, £25.4 million related to maintenance and £8.4 million related to growth. While our maintenance capital expenditures have increased on an absolute basis over the last three years, our maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue remained relatively stable, at 3.3%, 4.1% and 4.1% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. We have also increased efficiencies across our business by consolidating production in locations with excess capacity while rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. At the same time, we enhanced our logistics capabilities in the United Kingdom, which is our largest geographical segment. In 2017, we began the reorganization of our United Kingdom manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve productivity, manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our Kidderminster factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the relocation of our distribution center in the Midlands, which we completed in 2018. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our United Kingdom carpet production being shared between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. In 2019, we completed a similar initiative in Australia, which resulted in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have made further efficiency gains with the opening of our Southern Distribution Center near London, servicing all of our United Kingdom and Continental European carpet brands. In the 2020 financial year, we further increased our logistics capabilities through the in-sourcing of underlay delivery logistics, which has improved service levels and distribution flexibility, and additional investment in our logistics-focused subsidiary, Alliance Flooring Distribution. The foregoing initiatives have markedly improved the efficiency of our soft flooring businesses, resulting in increased logistics capacity and reduced delivery costs in the United Kingdom. We are also pursuing a number of smaller initiatives, begun in the 2020 financial year, to increase production capacity and operational efficiencies where possible. These include further consolidation of carpet manufacturing capabilities, improvements in underlay production and administrative cost reductions in our ceramic tile businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.9,Strategy,521.9.1,Continue to generate sustainable organic top-line growth in selected product segments,"Our growth since 2013 has created a consolidated platform in carpeting, flooring underlay, flooring accessories, ceramic tile and LVT products. While the Group has grown over this period largely through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth was 1.6%, 2.0% and 0.4% for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial years, respectively. We intend to continue to utilize our platform in order to defend our market position, develop new products, and leverage our distribution channels to drive organic top-line growth. When investing in our organic development, we target product segments in which we benefit from existing high margins and where we can increase operational efficiencies. For example, we benefit from high margins in our ceramic tile segments, and have completed investments in Keraben to increase ceramic 107 ----- production capacity. These investments include the development of a new production plant, which began production in 2020, the installation of new clay atomizers in floor and wall plants designed to increase clay reception capacity and the installation of new inkjet printing machines for wall and floor pressing and glazing processes. Additionally, in the 2019 financial year, we completed the installations of a continuous clay mill and floor tile production plant within Keraben facilities, fueling production synergies across Saloni and Keraben, and a further carpet finishing line in South Wales to grow our Australian carpet manufacturing capabilities. In 2019, we completed a similar initiative in Australia, which resulted in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have strengthened our UK logistics network, including through the establishment of our new Southern Distribution Center and the relocation of our Midlands Distribution Center. In addition to optimizing our cost base, these initiatives are a competitive advantage as they allow our customers to distribute their products more efficiently, which we believe will drive increased sales. We are also pursuing a number of smaller initiatives, initiated in the 2020 financial year, to increase production capacity and operational efficiencies where possible. These include further consolidation of carpet manufacturing capabilities, improvements in underlay production and administrative cost reductions in our ceramic tile businesses. While our primary focus is on sales to retailers and the I&R market, we also aim to grow our contract offering directly to end-market consumers, particularly within the hospitality and leisure and construction end-markets. Though our Whitestone operating business currently services clients within these end-markets, we have identified these end-markets as targets for organic expansion as our existing presence is minimal. In light of our growing ceramic tile and LVT product offerings, we have begun designing and creating products specifically for these product segments with our sales teams concentrating marketing efforts in these areas. We are also making targeted investments into new product development and associated marketing materials, aided by our selective acquisitions in new strategic areas in which we believe there is superior and sustainable market growth and high margins. For example, we have expanded into the attractive Continental European ceramic tile industry with our Keraben, Saloni, Serra and Ibero businesses, and our recent acquisitions of Ascot and Keradom. Non-resilient flooring, mostly consisting of the ceramic tile segment, remains the most popular flooring solution across Continental Europe. Additionally, our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon give us a foothold in the rapidly expanding global artificial grass industry. We believe there are large, underpenetrated markets for these and other products and we intend to leverage the scale of our footprint and our diverse distribution channels in order to capitalize on these opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.9,Strategy,521.9.2,Acquisitive growth to realize margin-driving synergies and integration,"We are a consolidator in a highly fragmented industry and believe we have built a reputation as a disciplined and credible acquirer. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives, the Group has grown from having Underlying EBITDA of £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to _Pro Forma EBITDA of £120.4 million for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2020. This growth supports our belief that the flooring market is suitable for further consolidation. Manufacturing in our industry is characterized by many small, inefficient and privately owned manufacturers. Further, we have been insulated from large-scale competition within the United Kingdom and Continental Europe as the largest global manufacturers operate in the United States. Small manufacturers offer potential economies of scale, stable backgrounds and typically operate in the I&R end-market, which is less sensitive to economic cycles. Most carpet manufacturers trade at or below net asset value and, therefore, incumbent owners are often keen to exit. With many retiring owners lacking a succession plan, we are seen as an ideal buyer among few buying players in the market. We are constantly sourcing new opportunities for acquisitive growth and aim to make two-to-three high-quality, complementary acquisitions per year while maintaining our disciplined leverage strategy. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic has motivated a number of incumbent business owners within the United Kingdom and Continental European flooring markets to look for exit opportunities, and we are in active discussions with potentially attractive targets as we continue to monitor acquisition opportunities. The acquisition origination process begins with a long list of market participants. Our policy is to avoid acquiring turnarounds, so we only invest in currently profitable and cash-generative businesses. After months of contact with the target’s management, and due diligence on the target’s operating sites and financials, we consider commercial and cultural fit, possible synergies and terms of the possible acquisition. In addition to our focus on well-run businesses with strong management teams, we stress contingent 108 ----- structuring of consideration, to motivate the target and to share downside risk. With strong, rational adherence to our acquisition strategy, we have been able to limit our downside risk. Our growth through acquisitions has allowed us to use our scale to drive operating margins. After an acquisition, we maintain the target’s customer-facing teams, such as design, branding, sales and marketing. This feet-on-the-ground approach allows for product and brand differentiation while simultaneously maintaining responsiveness to dynamic customer demand. At the same time, operational integration drives the realization of cost-savings synergies in procurement, production, logistics and IT. These initiatives result in better buying terms with suppliers of raw materials, better working capital management through SKU reduction and rationalization of product lines and manufacturing assets. Importantly, our acquisition strategy creates the potential for further future consolidation of manufacturing capacity. We are able to realize depot, fleet and load consolidation for a more efficient logistical process. More efficient retail network relationships created through consolidation also yield commercial synergies such as product bundling and cross-selling while further driving sales growth and SKU reduction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.9,Strategy,521.9.3,Generate free cash flow to enable de-leveraging,"A hallmark of a successful flooring business is its generation of free cash flow and high cash conversion rates. These are due to the longevity of flooring manufacturing plants, the relatively low capital requirements of those plants, relatively inelastic demand, and price inelasticity. When coupled with our synergistic acquisitions, we have consistently been able to consolidate production capability, increasing utilization, reducing SKUs, increasing stock turnover and establishing favorable trading terms with suppliers and customers. Together, these elements have the effect of further increasing our free cash flow. High free cash flow, in turn, allows us to rapidly de-lever. Although much of our historical growth has been through acquisitions, we have successfully maintained stable net leverage in part by funding certain of these acquisitions through equity offerings. Maintaining low leverage ensures the long-term health of the Group and gives us headroom for further acquisitions. We had pro forma senior net leverage of 2.8x as of October 3, 2020 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16—Leases). We intend to use our cash flow to decrease our overall leverage.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

When Geoffrey Wilding joined as Executive Chairman in 2012, a new board was appointed to conduct a full strategic review of the Group. In 2014, Mr. Wilding acquired a controlling stake in the Group. Since our formation, we have grown beyond our initial soft flooring offerings and gained scale through acquisitions in the fragmented flooring industry diversifying both by product and geography. Since 2013, we have made 18 acquisitions across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia to become an international player in the flooring industry. In late 2017, we expanded our position in Continental Europe, with the acquisition of Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Both Serra and Keraben are Continental European hard flooring manufacturers. Also, in early 2017, in response to the robust growth of the artificial grass market, we gained artificial grass-manufacturing capability through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands. We additionally acquired the business and assets of Millennium in 2017, a carpet distribution business based in Belgium, further enhancing our presence in the UK high-volume market. We further increased our presence in the Continental European hard flooring market through our acquisitions of Saloni in August 2018 and Ibero in August 2019, which are both Spanish ceramic tile manufacturers, along with the acquisitions of the Italian ceramic tile manufacturers Ascot and Keradom in 2020. In 2019, we acquired Estillon B.V., a small underlay distributor in Continental Europe, and further added to our soft flooring distribution offering in the United Kingdom with our acquisition of Hanover in January 2021.

We also manufacture a small amount of carpet products which are used for niche end-market uses, such as for use in feature films or bespoke automobiles. We provide carpeting products for both indoor and 110 ----- outdoor use, with our offerings including braided, hooked, needle-punched and tufted carpeting. The carpet products we sell are mid- to upper-market offerings made of wool and synthetic materials. We manufacture our carpet products within the United Kingdom and Australia and sell locally within these markets. We benefit from their historical carpeting production infrastructure and the clear local consumer preference for carpeting over other types of flooring products. _Other products LVT_ Luxury vinyl tile is a resilient hard flooring product, which currently is a small but fast-growing area of the hard flooring segment. LVT is offered at a lower price point than non-resilient flooring and benefit from high underfoot comfort, noise absorption, durability and wear resistance.

Ceramic tiles constitute the large majority of non-resilient flooring demand throughout our geographical segments, and we export significant amounts of our ceramic tile products outside of the traditional ceramic tile manufacturing bases of Spain and Italy. We export these products primarily to countries within Continental Europe. In 2016, we expanded from our historic focus on carpeting with the aim of capturing opportunities in the ceramic tile market, as an increasing proportion of flooring sold is ceramic tiles. In November 2017, we acquired Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Serra is an efficient, mid-market manufacturer of ceramic tile products, supplying retailers, distributors and DIY chains throughout Continental Europe. Keraben is one of Spain’s largest ceramic tile manufacturers with a reputation for high quality products and customer service. We further increased our footprint in the ceramic flooring segment with our 2018 acquisition of Saloni in Spain, our 2019 acquisitions of Ibero in Spain and Ascot in Italy and our 2020 acquisition of Keradom in Italy, all manufacturers of mid- to upper-market ceramic tiles, giving us better access to the ceramic tile market.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.16,Sales,521.16.1,End-Market,"We believe, based on the composition of our customer base that the majority of our products are for residential use. Residential buildings encompass single-family homes, multi-family structures and 112 ----- manufactured housing. This residential end-market can be further classified as either new construction or I&R (with I&R constituting over two-thirds of the residential flooring market and the source of over 90% of our revenues in the 2020 financial year). Based on the high number of independent retailers we supply, we believe the I&R end-market also constitutes the large majority of our sales. New residential construction flooring demand follows the growth in new building construction, while I&R is directly linked to personal income levels. The non-residential end-market consists of office, retail, institutional, industrial and other business or government facilities. Flooring in the non-residential end-market can also be classified as either new construction or I&R, with the latter also representing around three-quarters of demand in the non-residential end-market. In particular, businesses with heavy decorative flooring needs (e.g. hotels and other hospitality facilities) drive growth in the non-residential I&R end-market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.16,Sales,521.16.2,,"We generally operate a business-to-business sales model and therefore rarely access our end-consumers directly. Consequently, we rely on our customers’ ability to sell and market our products effectively in order to increase our revenue and generate sustainable cash flows. As our customers grow, they tend also to increase their orders with us. We seek to maintain strong relationships with our customers and work collaboratively with them to help increase store traffic and grow their business. Significantly, we sell the majority of our products directly to flooring retailers, which comprised 66.6% of our sales in the 2020 financial year, rather than third-party distributors, driving brand loyalty and long-term relationships. In order to maximize our profit margins, our involvement in the supply chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold direct to consumers. A small portion of our revenue is generated from large retail chains, and we benefit from a diversified customer base. Unlike some of our competitors, the majority of our revenue (43.8% in the 2020 financial year) comes from independent retailers (including DIY retailers) while a smaller proportion (22.8% in the 2020 financial year) comes from large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2020 financial year, our largest ten customers only accounted for approximately 18% of our revenue, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue. No single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the 2020 financial year. Outside the top 10 customers, we have a diversified base of over 5,000 customers. We also sell certain of our products in certain jurisdictions to wholesalers where there is a structural or commercial rationale for doing so, and engage in a small amount of contract work for the construction or hospitality industry (1.0% of Group revenue in the 2020 financial year). We maintain a decentralized operating structure, with each of our operating subsidiaries possessing its own front-office sales team. Each sales office has its own organization, responding to the structural particularities of that geographical segment and the preferences of the local region. One of the strengths of our sales force is its ability to respond to local demand. Our sales professionals use a variety of sales tools and techniques to promote our products. These include the distributing of samples, advertising in trade publications, participating in trade fairs, distributing point of sales materials, and establishing showrooms. In keeping with industry practices, we do not have formal purchase arrangements with a substantial majority of our customers. Purchase arrangements do not have standard terms and conditions, are typically on a non-exclusive basis, contain no minimum purchase obligations and do not have a fixed term or may be terminated on short notice. We believe that our market-leading positions across our core markets, together with our wide product range and our international production and distribution capabilities, allow us to closely track and adapt to customer behavior and adjust our production levels to match demand. We analyze our sales data and we are able to identify target end-customers and price points. We also use our data to identify product range gaps or product ranges that require replacement. Our analysis drives our design process.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.17,Design,521.17.1,,"We believe we are at the forefront of design in the flooring industry. We employ a commercially-focused design process, centered on four strategic pillars: aesthetic design, quality, operations and cost. The product design and development team leverages the strong relationships we have with our customers in order to coordinate our product development strategy and to ensure the rapid development and launch of innovative offerings and product upgrades. In particular, as a result of our vertical integration, our significant contacts with retailers and our presence in multiple product segments, we are able to receive substantial feedback regarding end-consumer trends in design, pricing and supply volumes. We follow consumer preferences and demand trends closely. We use a systematic approach to collection planning, and we maintain a short design-to-product cycle. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes are mutually reinforcing, resulting in product specifications that align with our target customers and price points while ensuring optimal margins. We have the ability to set up our machines and re-engineer our production facilities, as well as increase our production capacity to manufacture new and different products in response to changing trends and consumer preferences. In addition, the breadth of our product offerings and our ability to redeploy our machines to make new designs makes us less subject to the success or failure of any given collection. New products must also meet our high-quality standards; and, weight, thickness, durability and finish are among the elements that we evaluate. Because of our high-quality standards, manufacturing feasibility is another primary consideration. We also assess our existing production capacity; from an operations perspective, we assess the ease of integration of a new potential product into existing production runs and its impact on SKU and stock management. We also perform standard cost and margin assessments of a potential new offering.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.18,Manufacturing,521.18.1,Raw Materials,"Our in-house manufacturing is centered around our carpeting, ceramics and underlay segments. For carpeting products, synthetic yarn remains the largest single raw material expense. Though synthetic yarn is an oil-based product, we benefit from minimal price-pressure because we source materials globally from a large number of suppliers. The primary raw materials of our ceramic offerings are clay, which we are able to source locally in Spain and Italy, and natural gas supply, for which we maintain a 12-month forwardhedging policy. Underlay can also be manufactured using polyurethane foam (‘‘PU’’) trim or rubber: PU is a ‘‘virgin’’ waste product from other manufacturing industries, such as furniture manufacturing, and can be sourced from a global market. Rubber prices have consistently declined over the last decade. Because we manufacture underlay using both PU and rubber, we can alternate production to reflect price increases in either PU or rubber. Our raw materials expense (including direct costs such as packaging) was £50.0 million, which is equivalent to 8.0% of our revenue for the 2020 financial year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.18,Manufacturing,521.18.2,Supply Chain,"We have a broad range of suppliers, with minimal concentration risk. Our suppliers are generally located in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Turkey and China. For the 2020 financial year, our top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 19% of our total expenditure with third parties. We can easily pass supplier price increases to our customers, and we maintain a low foreign currency risk profile, as approximately 17% of our 2020 financial year cost base was incurred in foreign currencies. We also offset 113 ----- currency fluctuation through our Group-wide hedging strategy; for example, we use our local currency income first to satisfy local currency costs, and then we apply a forward-hedging policy on the remainder. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative _and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk.’’_ Bulk purchases of a small number of raw materials such as synthetic yarn are coordinated at the Group level, and prices of these Group-level bulk purchases are reviewed every six-to-twelve months by senior management. We do not utilize a central purchasing department, though our operating businesses’ purchasing functions operate in accordance with a Group-defined framework. For key raw materials, we run a competitive auction process with a range of approved suppliers. In the case of certain raw materials, such as PU and natural gas, prices are fixed through long-term agreements. However, we generally prefer shorter-term agreements, as the scale of our business, the fungibility of certain key raw materials suppliers (we maintain relationships with alternative raw materials suppliers with whom we do not currently trade) and the competitive nature of the markets for a number of our raw materials give us significant purchasing power and leverage over our supply partners. We are therefore able to manage third-party costs tightly while ensuring supply security through supply chain redundancy. We have robust in-house manufacturing capabilities, and we do not outsource a significant amount of manufacturing operations. We, however, utilize some contract manufacturers and other manufacturers’ spare capacity on a small scale to balance our own carpet and ceramic manufacturing capacity and cost, and to increase manufacturing flexibility. For certain smaller product segments of our offering, commercial sense requires that we outsource the full production. For example, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) is considerably easier than other flooring products to transport and warehouse, and there is a well-established and cost-effective manufacturing base in Asia.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.18,Manufacturing,521.18.3,Production,"Our core manufacturing activities are centered around three product segments: carpet, ceramic tile and flooring underlay. Manufacturing processes between these products differ significantly. For example, our tufted carpet manufacturing process begins with yarn extrusion (extraction of yarn filaments from synthetic granulates). The resulting yarn filaments are then dyed and spun, set up on beams and creels, and finally tufted, backed and cut. Our ceramic tiles are milled from raw materials, pressed, then dried and glazed. After rolling into shape, the tiles are fired in a kiln before being cut into squares. Our PU underlay manufacturing begins with the manufacture of PU foam and subsequent exposure to binding agents. Once bonded under high-pressure steam, the underlay is dried, peeled, laminated and cut. Rubber underlay is manufactured by combining manufacturing liquids and powdered rubber, extruding and rolling flat the resulting putty, then baking in a ‘‘heat-setting’’ process before cutting the final product into shape. We have robust in-house manufacturing capabilities and we do not outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing. Broadloom tufted carpets, one of our key carpeting products, are large and heavy, difficult to manufacture in short runs and because they are large and non-palletized, are difficult to transport over long distances and relatively easy to damage. Ceramic tiles generally are similarly heavy and difficult to transport. These factors represent significant barriers to entry for low-cost international imports and are why the vast majority of carpet and ceramic flooring in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is produced by locally-based manufacturers. The location of our production facilities in the United Kingdom and in the center of Continental Europe in close proximity to our key United Kingdom and Continental European end-markets is a key competitive advantage, helping to minimize end-product transportation costs and delivery lead times to these markets. In certain instances, we also utilize contract manufacturers and other manufacturers’ spare capacity on a small scale to balance our own carpet and ceramic manufacturing capacity and cost, and to increase manufacturing flexibility. Most individual steps in our manufacturing processes across all our manufactured products are modular, such that multiple processes for the same product can be run simultaneously—we are therefore rarely limited by manufacturing infrastructure bottlenecks. Outsourcing is utilized in parts of the production process (for example, in the yarn extrusion process) to provide manufacturing flexibility and downside protection. For certain smaller product segments, there is a strong commercial rationale for fully outsourcing our production. For example, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) can be palletized and is therefore considerably easier than 114 ----- other flooring products to transport and warehouse, with a well-established and cost-effective manufacturing base in Asia. Our manufacturing activities are spread across 17 locations (seven in the United Kingdom, seven in Continental Europe and three in Australia). In the 2018 financial year, we consolidated our United Kingdom carpet manufacturing at our Yorkshire and South Wales factories while closing our Kidderminster factory as well as insourcing certain production. In 2019, we completed a similar initiative in Australia, which resulted in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney.

Our in-house warehousing capability is a competitive advantage, and is a barrier to entry for future potential competition. By holding stock for certain products on our customers’ behalf, and by subsequently delivering upon receipt of orders, we benefit from real-time market data and feedback while limiting our de-stocking risk. This service is a core part of our customer offering, and a key structural strength. The combination of our stocking services with our design and manufacturing capabilities results in vertical integration that differentiates us from much of our competition. In general, stock management, warehousing and transport differ by product segment. Among our product offering, broadloom carpet is the most complex to distribute. As a result of the size and weight of broadloom carpets, and the equipment required to cut them into end-product sizes, many independent retailers are not able to hold stock. For these customers, the Group often holds stock on their behalf, while the customer retains Group-branded display stands and samples in-store. Our sales teams are subsequently provided a summary of end-consumer orders which are then cut from ‘‘mother rolls’’ in our distribution centers, wrapped and delivered in-store. Typical stock turn in our carpet distribution centers is approximately three times per year. Ceramic tiles are also stocked to meet ongoing customer demand, but without the need for any further processing (e.g. cutting) as with broadloom carpets. Similar to our carpet offering, specialist retail customer deliveries follow from in-store consumer orders based on samples we provide. Ceramics, however, have a larger wholesale market and are also sold for use in the DIY market—these retailers are able to hold stock and are suited to bulk delivery. Given the structure of the Continental European ceramic tile production market (with producers concentrated in Spain and Italy), customers arrange transport rather than manufactures. Typical stock turn is approximately three-to-four times a year for specialist retailers and nine-to-ten times a year for DIY retailers. Underlay is more commonly sold through distributors and large-chain retailers. As a result, inventory turnover of finished goods is greater, and deliveries tend to be in bulk, direct from the factory warehouse 115 ----- to customer warehouses. These products come in standard widths of four-meter rolls, and are much lighter and easier to handle than carpets or ceramics. Typical stock turn is approximately ten times a year. Our objectives when we transport our products include maintaining our on-time delivery record while managing transportation costs. Some of our subsidiaries own their own transport infrastructure, with the Group operating a fleet of approximately 200 goods vehicles. Additionally, some subsidiaries utilize thirdparty service providers to transport products from our production facilities to the relevant warehouse or distribution center, as well as to our customers and end-consumers. In 2017, we began the reorganization of our United Kingdom logistics operations to improve productivity and customer service. This process included the relocation of our distribution center in the Midlands to our Kidderminster site, which we completed in 2018. Further efficiency gains have been made from the completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center in Hemel Hempstead, England, servicing all of our brands. In the 2020 financial year, we further increased our logistics capabilities through the in-sourcing of underlay delivery logistics, which has improved service levels and distribution flexibility, and additional investment in our logistics-focused subsidiary, Alliance Flooring Distribution. We have also begun construction on a new storage warehouse for finished carpet rolls in Wales to reduce the cost of volume shipments and reduce pressure on our other logistics centers located in England, which we expect will be completed in March 2021.

Their principal objective is to ensure the safety and protect the health of end-market users by demonstrating that the product complies with regulatory requirements, which relate primarily to fire-resistance, slip-resistance and limits on toxic fumes. Non-mandatory standards are primarily testing standards to determine a product’s technical characteristics such as acoustic properties or dimensional stability, and specifications relating to minimum thresholds for a specific use. These standards vary depending on the product and its intended use, such as schools, hospitals or homes. These standards allow buyers, decision-makers and end-market users to be informed of the 117 ----- characteristics of our flooring in order to better differentiate between our products and those of our competitors.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.27,Regulation of Our Business,521.27.3,Standard Organizations and Standards Used in Other Jurisdictions,"Standard organizations define the technical characteristics and performance that a product must meet, as well as the tests to be used. At the international level, the principal organization in charge of publishing our applicable standards is the International Organization for Standardization (‘‘ISO’’). Compliance with ISO standards is based on the principles developed by the World Trade Organization, and is technically voluntary, although often required by architects and contractors, in particular for government contractors. Furthermore, agreements between ISO and the European Union enable the transposition of an ISO standard into a European standard. In Europe, standards are established by the European Committee for Standardization (‘‘CEN’’). These standards, called ‘‘EN’’ standards, are mandatory when referenced by a European regulation. European directives also define requirements for each product. ‘‘Harmonized’’ EN standards may be either mandatory or optional. They concern the health and safety of end-market users as well as energy savings. If a product is shown to comply with certain harmonized standards, it is automatically deemed to comply with requirements under European directives. Compliance with harmonized standards enables a manufacturer to obtain the ‘‘CE’’ label, governed by Regulation (EC) No. 305/2011 of April 24, 2011, which came into effect on July 1, 2013. We market our products in Europe under this label. The CE label indicates that we certify that the product complies with the various harmonized standards and that the flooring has undergone adequate testing. Among the mandatory harmonized standards, fire-retardant and fire-resistance standards, anti-slip standards and toxic emissions standards are the most important. For example, we comply with EN Standard 14041, which details requirements for resilient and laminate hard flooring and carpets. In addition, we can be required to comply with standards issued by national organizations in various European Union member states. We are subject to national standards in the countries where we sell our products. Countries such as Australia, also develop standards as well as national regulations with which we may be required to comply.

(2) Any such Lien created as a result of this covenant ‘‘Limitation on Liens’’ in favor of the Notes or any such Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates or (ii) as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Security.’’",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.12,Certain Covenants,21.12.5,Change of Control,"(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal amount of A100,000 or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’) in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Date’’). (2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control Offer, with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing in the register on such date, which notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent, or such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under the Exchange Act or any other applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid on such date; (e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and (f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. (3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to each Holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of A100,000 or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. (4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) the Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the Notes in the manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such tender offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than A100,000 in original principal amount of such Note would remain outstanding following such purchase. 165 ----- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could (i) lead to a mandatory prepayment and cancellation of all amounts and facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (ii) require the Issuer to make an offer to holders of the Existing Notes to repurchase the Existing Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence, however, of a Holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of Control. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds were available, the terms of any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes the rights described under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’ An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, would result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements,’’ including under the Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture_ governing the Existing Notes. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset Sale, within 365 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net Cash Proceeds are so used within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period), may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt,’’ that is secured by the Collateral on a basis _pari passu with or in priority to the Notes and is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Debt that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Debt or Debt that is owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Debt secured by a Lien on the Collateral at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Debt plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; _provided that the Issuer shall redeem, repay, repurchase or redeem any such Pari Passu Debt_ pursuant to this clause (iii) only if the Issuer makes an offer to the Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Excess Proceeds 167 ----- Offer on a ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Debt repaid pursuant to this clause (iii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Excess Proceeds Offer for purposes hereof); or (iv) to make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Excess Proceeds Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Excess Proceeds Offer for purposes hereof); (b) to invest in any Replacement Assets or make capital expenditures (including by means of capital expenditure by, or an investment in Replacement Assets by, a Restricted Subsidiary with an amount equal to some or all of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); or (c) do any combination of the foregoing. The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds actually received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary but not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture. (3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £25.0 million and 22.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will, within 30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an ‘‘Excess Proceeds Offer’’) from all Holders of Notes and, at the Issuer’s election, from the holders of any Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount, in the case of the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of A 100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such Note being repurchased and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt being redeemed or repurchased, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt, if any, for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder). Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero. (4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such Holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act. Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant by virtue thereof. 168 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of Notes. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (e) under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (e) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture (except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which case, the consent of the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with 180 ----- any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and provided that the fees and expenses of the Trustee have been paid. No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any remedy thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such written notice and receipt of indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will deliver to each Holder of the Notes notice of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of such Notes if it determines in good faith that withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of the Holders of the Notes. The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders provide to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017), (the ‘‘Recast Insolvency",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI ‘‘shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties’’ and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as at the date the company enters an insolvency proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor’s COMI is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g. the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). If the ‘‘COMI’’ of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings must be 215 ----- ‘‘secondary.’’ Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined in Article 2(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean ‘‘any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.’’ Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. In addition, the concept of ‘‘group coordination proceedings’’ has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any of the Issuer or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer or Guarantors. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (‘‘exit day’’) and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be made to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applies from January 1, 2021, but is still subject to formal approval by the European Parliament. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private 216 ----- international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below)) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. 217 ----- Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer or the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustees, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators’ powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge— however an administrator may only dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the leave of the court or with the consent of the secured creditor). The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. A secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator’s powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (UK) (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Regulations’’). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be extended by court order or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors). The English Obligor(s) may exit administration if the administrator is satisfied that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon application to and order of the court if the administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume normal business upon exiting administration. However, the administrator also has the power, should he conclude that there is no reasonable prospect of rescuing the company, to either place the company into liquidation or use his powers under, and in accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company’s assets and thereby achieve substantially the same result as a liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital market investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically provided for in English law security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925 for the holder of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to appoint a receiver over the charged assets to collect the income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction of the secured debt. A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the security documentation which typically provide for the ability to appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in accordance with their terms. Once appointed, the receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The charge document pursuant to which the receiver is appointed will typically set out the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these powers will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged assets, with the proceeds being used to pay the secured creditors. An administrative receiver’s and, typically, a receiver’s primary duty is to realize the secured assets and to pay the proceeds to the secured creditor, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the prescribed part (discussed below)). He does, however, also owe duties to the company, in particular a duty to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable at the relevant time when selling any asset. There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and terminating contracts. If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the appointment of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the administrator consents or the court permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. In contrast the appointment of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the appointment of an administrator. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed over part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. 219 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘MVL’’) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘CVL’’). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales, with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an ‘‘establishment’’ in England and Wales or which have a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except Denmark) but which has an ‘‘establishment’’ in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a ‘‘financial collateral arrangement’’ under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation. A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail. A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract. In 220 ----- addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply where the collateral-provider or collateral-taker under the arrangement is being wound up, to any financial collateral arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors. A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area but has its COMI in a member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) or in the UK. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company’s directors (if the relevant company is not in administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the administrator or the liquidator (as applicable). The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s unsecured debts, but may also form part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different creditor groups. If the proposals under the CVA are approved by the requisite majority of creditors (i.e. a majority in excess of 75% in value of creditors who respond in the decision procedure) and provided that those voting against the proposal do not include more than 50% in value of creditors who are unconnected with the company whose claims are admitted for voting, a CVA will bind all unsecured creditors of a company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure—however a CVA will not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors unless they agree to the proposals. Shareholders of the company will also be asked to vote on the CVA but whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. 221 ----- The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. - Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘‘FSCS’’) up to the statutory limit. - Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii) VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. - This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which preceded such liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act). An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge 222 ----- security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his associates together have control of it. A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or (ii) it is controlled by a person and that person’s associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is controlled by a group of two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings. 223 ----- _Transactions at an undervalue_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see ‘‘England _and Wales—Connected persons’’ above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the_ connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith 224 ----- and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company. _Voidable floating charges_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a Connected Person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months before the onset of insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge, the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company, and of the interest on any such amount. No court action is required. Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests. It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transactions_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation 225 ----- (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While Recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory 226 ----- provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with ‘‘likely’’ in this context meaning ‘‘probable.’’ Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to UK company law. Under UK company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 21-day period has been extended to 31 days under the Companies etc. (Filing Requirements) (Temporary Modifications) Regulations 2020.

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act and (ii) has ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to the English jurisdiction. In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. 227 ----- Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the United Kingdom legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include the following: _Moratorium_ Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a ‘monitor’. Despite the existence of a ‘‘payment holiday’’ in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under an obligation incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as ‘‘priority pre-moratorium debts’’), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts. Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than on the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition. _Restructuring Plan_ CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006 (see ‘‘England and Wales—Scheme of Arrangement’’), but with an ability for a crossclass cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. This new standalone 228 ----- restructuring plan under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a restructuring plan. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see above), any creditors in respect of ‘‘moratorium debts’’ and ‘‘priority pre-moratorium debts’’ (see ‘‘Moratorium’’) may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the Restructuring Plan without their consent. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant meeting, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic interest in the company. The creditors/members of a class are deemed to approve a restructuring plan if at least 75% in value of the creditors/members of that class who are present and voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in favour of the proposals. Unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in number of those creditors present and voting to vote in favour of a restructuring plan for class approval to be given. As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme or arrangement does not have, a ‘‘cross-class cram down’’ provision. This allows the court to sanction a restructuring plan even if not all of the relevant classes of creditors and/or members have voted in favour of it. In order for the court to sanction a cross-class cram down the court must be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the ‘‘relevant alternative’’ (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and that the plan has been agreed by 75% in value of a class of creditors or members present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court’s discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see above) to provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible. _Statutory demands and winding-up petitions (temporary measure)_ CIGA 2020 (as amended) has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding-up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and March 31, 2021 (subject to change) on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a statutory demand where the statutory demand was served between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have existed 229 ----- even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding-up orders made in respect of such petitions. Similarly, no winding-up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding-up orders made during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force will be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its ‘‘pre-petition’’ position. _So-called ‘‘Henry VIII’’ powers_ CIGA 2020 further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person’s corporate duties and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligors would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, as discussed in the section ‘‘—European Union’’ above, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and, where a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union, any main insolvency proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State. Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an ‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the event where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or in bad faith. Certain case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of proof), usually through a motion for declaratory relief filed by the guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Because of this prohibition, a creditor must initiate the enforcement of the security interest and use as payment of the debt the proceeds obtained in the sale of the collateral in a public auction or through certain other proceedings aimed at ensuring that fair value is obtained from the enforcement process. These proceedings are monitored either by a court or a notary public, depending on the type of proceeding. The only applicable exceptions to the prohibition of the ‘‘pacto comisorio’’ are the following: - financial collateral arrangements: Royal Decree-Law 5/2005, of March 11, 2005 (‘‘RDL 5/2005’’), which implements in Spain Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002, on financial collateral arrangements, regulates, among other matters, financial collateral arrangements. RDL 5/2005 regulates the two following types of financial collateral arrangements: title transfer collateral arrangements (acuerdos de garant´ıa financiera con cambio de titularidad) and 231 ----- security financial collateral arrangements (acuerdos de garant´ıa pignoraticia) (i.e. pledges over cash or securities); and - pledges of credit rights: As an exception to the general rule that requires the enforcement of pledges through a public auction, pledges over credit rights may be ‘‘foreclosed’’ by way of set-off since the pledged credit rights or receivables are considered ‘‘liquid’’ (i.e. credit rights arising from the relevant bank accounts and receivables). In other words, the asset does not need to be ‘‘realized’’ into money because it is precisely the right to claim an amount of money such as the balance of a bank account or the right to receive payment of the receivable. Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario). The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type that would be enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.4,Spain,1339.4.3,Parallel debt/Security agent,"Security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the secured parties under the relevant security document, and each secured party must accept said security interest. Spanish law does not recognize the concept of ‘‘security agent’’ holding security on behalf of a syndicate of lenders or parallel debt structures. Therefore, to validly create a security interest or guarantee under Spanish Law, it must be granted in favor of its purported beneficiaries, which shall be party to the relevant Spanish law security document and accept the security either directly or through a duly empowered third party (such as the security agent). There is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a security agent (including the Security Agent) and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent’s actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent (such as the Security Agent) would only be entitled to enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the other secured parties. In those cases where an entity acts as security agent (including the Security Agent) of the actual beneficiaries of the security interest or a guarantee (i.e. the creditors of the secured obligations), such security agent should be duly empowered for that purpose at the time it acts as security agent. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent, may be subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties (e.g., lenders and the holders of the notes) in favor of the Security Agent for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961). Regardless of the authority that may be conferred upon the security agent under the relevant financing framework agreement, such agent will need to prove that it is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of duly notarized and apostilled powers of attorney by all lenders in its favor. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged. 232 ----- The concept of ‘‘parallel debt’’ may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court. Further, it is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant secured obligations arise (i.e. the Indenture and any supplemental indentures in case of the Notes), and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes. _Enforcement Proceedings in Spain_ Creditors are entitled to initiate actions under the following three types of proceedings: (i) the so-called declarative proceeding (juicio declarativo) provided for under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000, of January 7, 2000 (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil); (ii) the executive proceeding (juicio _ejecutivo) provided for under the same Spanish regulation; and (iii) the procedure managed by notaries to_ enforce guarantees under Article 1,872 of the Spanish Civil Code, which must be jointly interpreted with the Notary Public Law of 28 May 1862 (the ‘‘Notarial Law’’) that establishes the requisites to be met by the mentioned notary public auction system regulated in the Spanish Civil Code. The aforementioned procedures are aimed at selling the relevant asset in a public auction monitored either by a Court or by a notary public if the debtor does not verify payment of the amount due prior to the public auction. As for first demand guarantees, either declarative proceedings or executive proceedings (if the guarantee is granted in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000) could be used to enforce payment from the guarantor. The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in the Notarial Law was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of 2 July on voluntary jurisdiction (‘‘Law",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Due to this, they would be declared null, void and/or terminated if the principal obligation is declared null, void and/or terminated. Any transfer of the principal obligation carries along with it the transfer of the security interest. Additionally, the transfer of the security interest itself cannot be done independently from the principal obligation due to its accessory nature. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are not existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the relevant guarantee or security are not enforceable because the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not existing and valid obligations. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations. Therefore, the primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement and they should be amended in parallel to any amendment of the primary obligation to clearly reflect the scope of the guaranteed and secured obligations and the identity of the secured parties. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by Article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. A Spanish company must have a corporate interest in granting the security interest. It is difficult to determine whether or not a corporate benefit is obtained when granting the so-called upstream security interests. Some factors may be considered, such as the receipt by the Spanish company of the funds (even indirectly) or the actual benefit that the Spanish company receives from the financing. The absence of a corporate interest may lead to the creditors of the Spanish company to contest, on the grounds of Article 1,111 of the Spanish Civil Code, acts carried out by the Spanish company implying fraud of the creditors’ rights. In addition, directors’ liability may be triggered. See ‘‘Risks Related to the Notes and Our _Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.’’_ In particular, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to grant security interests over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Therefore, as stated in section ‘‘Insolvency laws’’ below, guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor 230 ----- of other group companies may be challenged on the basis that such guarantees have no consideration unless evidence could be provided that there was a tangible and identifiable economic interest for the Spanish companies (beyond an abstract group interest). Whether there is a specific consideration in favor of the guarantor for the granting of the guarantee, is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis. The lack of proof in that regard, may entail, if the guarantee is challenged, that a judge declares the guarantee null and/or void. Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades an´onimas) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company, and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, guarantees or security interests granted by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares or its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such guarantee or security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Articles 150 and 143 of the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto _Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital)._ This limitation would also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt although this is widely debated between academics. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes. For example, where proceeds from the Notes are used to refinance the Existing Term Loan Facility, the value of the Guarantee granted by Saloni would be limited to the portion of the Existing Term Loan Facility not used to fund our acquisition of Saloni. In addition, and whilst this remains debatable, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantors relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee. Such limitation, _inter alia, may be referred to the net equity, net assets or share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or even_ the portion of the proceeds of the Notes used directly or indirectly to pay or refinance obligations of the Spanish Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this new legal framework given that some,1339.5.1,,"provisions of the Notarial Law seem to be in conflict with laws on the enforcement of pledges that were not expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open to interpretation. After the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of in rem securities (e.g., mortgages, pledges) affecting assets owned by the debtor and necessary for the continuity of its professional or business activities (presumably most of the debtor’s assets) will be stayed until the first of the following circumstances occurs: (i) approval of a creditors’ agreement (unless the content has been approved by the favorable vote of the creditor secured by the security, in which case the creditor will be bound to whatever has been agreed in the creditors’ agreement), (ii) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings having been initiated; or (iii) the court conducting the insolvency proceedings declares that the asset is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s activities in accordance with Spanish insolvency regulations. Pursuant to Spanish law, the creation of pledges requires the fulfillment of certain formalities in order for such security interests to be considered existing and perfected. ‘‘Ordinary’’ pledges (which may be created over shares/quotas, credit rights arising from contracts, etc.), for instance, require the transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee, and their formalization in a notarial document (which is not compulsory in all cases but habitual and advisable in order for the security interest to be effective vis-`a-vis third parties). The specific way to fulfill the request of transfer of possession varies depending on the nature of the assets to be pledged. In respect of pledges over credit rights arising from contracts or bank deposits/accounts, the transfer of possession requirement is met by formalizing such pledge in a notarial document and the pledge is typically notified to the relevant debtor/depositary bank. Hence, the formalizing of the pledge and (although not strictly and legally required) the notice to the relevant debtor/depositary bank would suffice for the purposes of creating this security. _Insolvency laws_ Any insolvency proceedings against Keraben and Saloni would be likely based on Spanish insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings and the Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of May 5, by virtue of which the Restated Spanish Insolvency Act is approved (the ‘‘Spanish Insolvency Act’’), where a Spanish company conducts business in another country, the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts may be 233 ----- limited if the company’s center of main interest is found to be in a country other than the Kingdom of Spain. This ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ are considered ‘‘the principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the ‘‘territorial insolvency",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw back actions where the subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a _iuris et de iure presumption (i.e. it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (i.e. it is a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor (or any other debts that may be owed to other creditors). Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages if it is proved that such third party incurred in willful misconduct when entering into the fraudulent agreement with the debtor. In any other case (i.e. if it is proved that the third party acted in good faith and was not aware of the debtor’s fraudulent intention) it will be the person who has actually and consciously caused the damage to the creditor who will have to reimburse the corresponding amount. The deadline to file a rescission action expires after four years as from the date when the claim could have been filed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.6,proceedings’’).,1339.6.2,,"Keraben and Saloni are incorporated under the laws of Spain. As a general rule, in the event of an insolvency of the a Spanish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings (bankruptcy) may be initiated in Spain and governed by Spanish law (provided that the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of the Spanish Guarantor is considered to be located in Spain) in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Act. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Spanish Insolvency Act and of various extraordinary resolutions including, among others, Royal Decree Law 34/2020 (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de _17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al sector energ´etico, y en materia tributaria) or Act 3/2020 (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ´ambito de la Administraci´on de Justicia) (‘‘Act 3/2020’’), that have been approved_ as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis. These resolutions have introduced several temporary and extraordinary measures that impact pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings. The Spanish Insolvency Act regulates insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of- court liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law, is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities). The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as ‘‘concurso de acreedores,’’ applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (composition agreement) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets. Both the debtor and creditors may initiate the insolvency proceeding. Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor and involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor. A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the insolvency petition upon inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the insolvency is declared and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action (including, inter alia, the possibility of submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and insolvency be classified as ‘‘guilty.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to article 6.1 of Act 3/2020, until 14 March 2021 (inclusive), or later if this term is extended, debtors that are insolvent will not have the duty to file for insolvency proceedings, whether or not they have notified the judge that negotiations have been opened with creditors to reach a refinancing agreement, an out-of-court payment agreement (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) or adherences to a debtor’s voluntary arrangement (propuesta anticipada de convenio). Moreover, pursuant to article 6.2 of Act 3/2020, until 14 March 2021 (inclusive) the courts will not accept mandatory insolvency filings filed after the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain on 14 March 2020. The general obligation to file for insolvency within two months from the date of being in a situation of current insolvency (insolvencia actual) does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain accessions to a pre-arranged anticipated composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or to reach an out-of-court refinancing agreement set out in Articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (‘‘notice of negotiation with creditors’’) and Articles 597 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Effectively, by means of the notice of negotiation with creditors of the 234 ----- Articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the debtor gains a three-month period to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one further month to file for insolvency, if after the above mentioned period of three months has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time, creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and enforcement will be prevented: (i) by creditors, other than public, over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business activities; and (ii) by financial creditors over any asset, provided financial creditors holding at least 51% of the total financial indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or continue enforcement proceedings against the debtor pursuant to Article 590 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced before the filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended. Creditors may file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor but must provide evidence of its actual and not just its imminent insolvency. To this end, creditors must prove to the court: (i) a generalized default on payments by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, ‘‘fire sale,’’ hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three months). However, creditors having acquired debt by means of inter _vivos acts and by a singular title after becoming due and payable may not file for the declaration of_ insolvency of the debtor within six months of the date of the debt acquisition. Creditors must communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal) within one month from the publication of the judicial resolution declaring the insolvency of the debtor in the Official Gazette (Bolet´ın Oficial del Estado), by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. In addition, the insolvency trustee is obliged to include all creditors appearing in the corporate documentation of the debtor in the list of creditors to be attached to the insolvency trustee’s report, even if such creditors did not communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee. The sole declaration of insolvency does not imply the automatic suspension of the business activities of the debtor. The insolvency court can either determine that the debtor continues to be managed by its management body under the supervision of the insolvency trustee, or that the management body loses control over the debtor, in which case the insolvency trustee will take over the full management of the debtor. The debtor may not carry out any management activity or enter into any new transactions concerning the disposal of its assets, unless approved by either the insolvency trustee or the management body with the authorization of the insolvency trustee. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void. Neither private nor governmentally-led foreclosure proceedings can be initiated or continued against the debtor’s assets after its declaration of insolvency. See the previous section ‘‘—Enforcement Proceedings in _Spain’’ for any details on the exceptions to the foregoing._ Set-off is not allowed under the Spanish Insolvency Act once a debtor has been declared insolvent, but where the operating requirements of set-off are met before the declaration of insolvency, set-off can still apply. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-`a-vis the insolvent company if the law governing the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it during insolvency proceedings. Accrual of both legal and contractual interest is suspended from the declaration of the insolvency except for those credits secured with in rem security up to the maximum amount covered by the relevant security. The general rule is the maintenance of all contracts entered into by the debtor from which obligations derive for both parties that are still outstanding, regardless of the declaration of insolvency or the existence of an early termination for insolvency clause in the relevant contract (which shall be deemed as not included within the agreement). Contracts can be terminated if one of the parties breaches its contractual obligations, although the court, even existing a termination cause, may force the fulfillment of the contract if it is in the interest of the debtor’s estate. Contracts can also be terminated if the insolvency trustees deem it convenient for the debtor’s estate upon approval of the insolvency court. In addition, the insolvency trustees and, under certain circumstances, other creditors may seek the termination of certain acts and contracts harmful to the debtor’s estate by initiating a claw-back action (see further details below). 235 ----- There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt with by the insolvency court. The judge’s insolvency resolution contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within a one-month period, by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and that held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims benefiting from special privileges, (ii) claims benefitting from general privileges, (iii) ordinary claims and (iv) subordinated claims. (a) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially _in rem _security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem_ securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims may entail separate proceedings, and are subject to certain restrictions related to a mandatory waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided that the relevant asset is necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to composition agreements (convenios), unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the arrangement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 65% (or 80% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of the specially privileged secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets. (c) Claims benefiting from general privileges including, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations are recognized as privileged for half of their amount, and so is 50% of the amount of the claims held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved. New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Articles 596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (cr´edito contra la _masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to be_ affected by the restructuring (if under a composition agreement) except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the composition agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law) and with the exception of secured assets, from which payments will be collected first by the relevant creditors holding claims with a special privilege. (d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a prorated basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and generally privileged claims. (e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives. In the case of a legal entity, this includes directors (whether duly appointed or ‘‘de facto’’ acting as such—administradores de hecho) and those holding general powers of attorney (including those that have held those positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration); group companies and their common shareholders, and any shareholders holding over 5% (for listed companies) or 10% (for non-listed companies) of the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Articles 596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the 236 ----- debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right are also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they may not vote on a composition agreement (convenio) and in the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full). Exceptionally, Article 7 of Act 3/2020 establishes that credits deriving from ‘‘cash receipts from loans, credits or other analogous transactions’’ granted to the debtor after the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain (i.e. 14 March 2020) by ‘‘specially related parties’’ will rank as ordinary claims if the debtor’s insolvency is declared before 14 March 2022. Likewise, ordinary and privileged credits of third parties upon which specially related persons have been subrogated as a consequence of the payment of those debts in the name and representation of the debtor as from 14 March 2020 will also rank as ordinary claims (and will keep any privilege of the credits, if applicable) in the debtor’s insolvency is declared before 14 March 2022. Notwithstanding the above, some claims are considered credits against the debtor’s estate and will be generally payable when due according to their own terms. Debts against the insolvency estate, include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after the insolvency of the debtor is declared (including the amounts payable as a consequence of the voluntary termination or breach of contract by the insolvent debtor if such breach or termination takes place after the declaration of its insolvency), (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw back actions within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency, (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a viability plan (plan de viabilidad) (‘‘VP’’) in accordance with Article 672 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, excluding claims granted by ‘‘specially related parties’’ to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose (Article 4.3 of Act 3/2020 provides an exception of this limitation in relation to ‘‘specially related parties’’ in case there is a default of a VP approved or modified between 14 March 2020 and 14 March 2022, as long as the new VP, or the amended one, identifies the obligor and the maximum amount of the financing to be granted or the guarantee to be perfected), and (viii) in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the funds lent in compliance with a refinancing arrangement in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 596 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act (except for new funds granted by persons specially related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose). Once the insolvency proceeding is instituted, the harmful actions to the debtor’s estate carried out by the debtor within two years prior to the date of declaration of the insolvency proceeding may be declared rescinded (rescindido) or clawed back. Some transactions are presumed detrimental to the debtor’s estate without the parties being able to provide evidence to the contrary, non-rebuttable presumptions, (e.g., disposal of assets without consideration and payment of non-matured unsecured obligations). In some cases, the prejudice is presumed although such presumption can be challenged (rebuttable presumption) as in the case of (i) disposal acts in favor of specially-related persons to the debtor; (ii) the granting of in rem rights as security for preexisting obligations (or new obligations in substitution of the preexisting obligations); or (iii) early repayment of secured obligations. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission. Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of the labor authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to; and (v) transactions that are a result of the implementation of resolutions measures upon credit entities and investment services entities. 237 ----- The Spanish Insolvency Act excludes as well certain types of refinancing agreements from the scope of claw-back actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted in execution of such agreements as explained in the ‘‘—Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain’’ section below. On top of claw-back actions, acts and contracts entered into by the debtor in fraud of creditors within the last four years may be judicially challenged (through the so-called ‘‘actio pauliana’’). If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts. The foreclosure of a security interest under the different proceedings set forth in the Spanish Civil Procedure Law (e.g., judicial or notarial auction) does not guarantee -at least in practice -that the proceeds to be obtained as a result of the enforcement proceeding are equivalent to the amount secured by such asset or even to the value on the asset. Enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under condition less favorable than those applicable to the principal debtor. Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called ‘‘group interest’’). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees. _Conclusion of insolvency Settlement_ Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages creditors to reach a composition agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. Such an agreement may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors whose credits exceed a fifth of all claims (masa _pasiva), and shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the_ composition agreement must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors. The composition agreement must contain proposals for write-offs and stays for a shorter period than 10 years. Articles 317 and 327 of Spanish Insolvency Act provide that it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of credits into shares, into profit-sharing credits, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets related to the debtor’s business activity to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the composition agreement. The proposals in the composition agreement shall include a payment schedule in accordance with Article 331 of Spanish Insolvency Act. In order for a composition agreement to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met at the creditors’ meeting: (a) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans (pr´estamos 238 ----- _participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of the ordinary claims have voted in favor of such_ composition agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will suffice when the composition agreement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less than 20%. (b) In case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, it will be required that at least the 65% of the ordinary credits should have voted for the composition agreement. The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled to vote. Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved composition agreement (unless they have expressly voted in its favor or adhered thereto), the effects of an approved composition agreement can be extended to privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition agreement has been approved by the following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial creditors or others): (a) In case the composition agreement contains the full payment of ordinary claims within a period not exceeding three years or the immediate payment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less than 20%, a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have voted in favor; and (b) In case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, at least 75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor. _Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain_ In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts) can also be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceedings of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, provided that, among other requirements, (i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones, all these in accordance with a viability plan enabling the continuity of the debtor business activity in the short and medium term; (ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, the majority refers both individually to each company and to the Group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not taken into account-); and (iv) the refinancing agreement and the documents sustaining performance of conditions (i) to (iii) above are formalized in a notarial deed. Such judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw-back action, but may be challenged in certain cases pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law (i.e., in case of breach of formalities or in case they impose disproportionate sacrifices on dissenting creditors—see below). As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement (for the purposes of petitioning protection against clawback) if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below: (a) Pursuant to Article 623 of Spanish Insolvency Act, if the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (pr´estamos participativos) of duration up to five years. 239 ----- Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of the specially privileged secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all specially privileged secured claims of the debtor pursuant to Article 626 of Spanish Insolvency Act. (b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: (i) stays of payments for up to ten years; (ii) uncapped haircuts; (iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap; (iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and (v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio _pro soluto)._ Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of the specially privileged secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the rules set out in the Spanish Insolvency Act), when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all the specially privileged secured claims of the debtor. _Liquidation_ Failure to obtain the approval of a composition agreement or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a composition agreement has been approved, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such composition agreement. Additionally, in such case, if the debtor does not file a petition for liquidation while the composition agreement is in force, any creditor may file such petition based on Article 407.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Act. Therefore, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits. The insolvency trustee will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the insolvency court. The insolvency trustee is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a different insolvency trustee pursuant to Article 427 of Spanish Insolvency Act. _Termination of the insolvency proceedings_ Article 465.6 of the Spanish Insolvency Act also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome. Finally, it must be noted that Article 465.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as no future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty. 240 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The bill entered into force on January 1, 2021. Under the CERP, a proceeding will become available to restructure debts of companies in financial distress outside insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘Dutch Scheme’’). The CERP provides that a debtor or a court-appointed restructuring expert may offer creditors (including secured creditors) and shareholders a composition plan. Upon confirmation by the court, such plan is binding on the creditors and shareholders to which it has been offered and changes their rights. A composition plan under the CERP can also extend to claims against group companies of the debtor on the account of guarantees for the debtor’s obligations, if _inter alia (i) the relevant group companies are reasonably expected to be unable to continue to pay their debts as they fall due and (ii) the Dutch courts would have jurisdiction if the relevant group company would offer its creditors and shareholders a composition plan under the CERP. Jurisdiction of the Dutch courts under the CERP may extend to entities incorporated or residing outside the Netherlands on the basis that there is a connection with the jurisdiction of the Netherlands. Under the CERP, voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two-third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The CERP provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross-class cram down). Under the CERP, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. Under the CERP, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge. Claims of creditors against the Dutch Guarantors can be compromised as a result of a composition plan adopted and confirmed in accordance with the CERP. A composition plan under the CERP can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the CERP can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The emergency legislation provides for a court-ordered moratorium and several related protections which currently apply and can, if and when necessary, be extended for two-month periods at a time. The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Tax authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/ debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-`a-vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two-month periods at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during such period: (i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed; (ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors; and 244 ----- (iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court. The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that as currently proposed, any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions. When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium retain these rights vis-`a-vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

However, guidelines issued by the Dutch courts provide that applications in insolvency and attachment matters (which may include enforcement of security) should clearly state whether, and how, the matters addressed in the relevant court petition are related to the COVID-19 pandemic and indicate that the Dutch courts will, on the relevant petition, consider all relevant circumstances to determine whether the filing constitutes an abuse of the current situation, which expressly includes the consideration of the impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, any enforcement action or court process may face delays or other practical challenges in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, if a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its administrator in a suspension of payments or its receiver in bankruptcy, if both (i) the obligations of the company under that transaction do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also all relevant circumstances, including whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang), whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in its corporate interest. The enforceability of the obligations of a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions. Under Dutch law, the obligations of a Dutch Guarantor may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare _tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general_ defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of 245 ----- the Notes. Other general defenses include claims that a security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include suspension of performance (opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening). Furthermore, the courts of the Netherlands may change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of abuse of authority (misbruik van bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests may be capable of being rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken) and the legal consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Under Dutch law, any creditor of a Dutch Guarantor (outside bankruptcy) or its administrator or receiver (in bankruptcy) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes (including the granting of the Guarantee or any security) was conducted without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions); and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal act entered into a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted (including the granting of the Guarantee or any security), the relevant Dutch Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the above-mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver in bankruptcy. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a ‘‘suspect period’’ of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply _mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver in bankruptcy may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

This is particularly relevant to certain Guarantors which are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and have their statutory seat (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’), and which are therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary and exceptions under the EU Insolvency Regulation) to have their COMI in the Netherlands. See further ‘‘—European Union’’ above. Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for you to recover the amount you would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by a Dutch Guarantor of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws. There are three insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, a pre-insolvency plan (onderhands akkoord), 241 ----- is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The third, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. All insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below. This general description is subject to the proposals discussed under the heading ‘‘—Proposed Emergency _Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic’’ below._ Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (meaning, more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its own bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar _Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds_ distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, can benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver in bankruptcy pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver in bankruptcy and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. A suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors (and in the case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there 242 ----- were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt debtor’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for the set-off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a suspension of payments is granted, and will terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In case of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver in bankruptcy’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The _renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. The claim of a_ creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. Interest on claims accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the Notes. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. 243 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The most common method for appointment of an administrator is by resolution of the company’s board. However, a creditor with a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property can also appoint an administrator (provided that security interest is immediately enforceable), as can a liquidator or provisional liquidator (if the company is already in liquidation or provisional liquidation). A company need not be presently insolvent to enter into voluntary administration, however in the case of an appointment by the company’s board or a liquidator or provisional liquidator, the appointer must believe that the company is likely to become insolvent at some future time. Voluntary administration is the only formal process in Australia with rehabilitation as one of its express goals. During the period of voluntary administration, there is a moratorium on claims by the company’s creditors, such that (with certain exceptions) no proceedings against the company, or in relation to the company’s property, can be commenced or continued with, and no enforcement processes can begin or proceed other than with the consent of the administrator or the relevant Australian Court. Similarly, a security interest cannot be enforced over the property of the company except with the consent of the administrator or the Court, unless the secured creditor holds a security interest over the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and enforces the security interest within 13 business days following the appointment of the administrator. These restrictions may affect the enforceability of the security interests granted by the Australian Guarantors if a voluntary administrator were appointed to those entities. The duration of voluntary administration is prescribed in the Australian Corporations Act and is intended to be for a short period of time, although the administrator can seek an order from an Australian Court to lengthen the period of the administration where the circumstances justify that course. During the period of voluntary administration, the administrator controls the company (the powers of the directors and officers are suspended). The administrator may carry on the business of the company and does so as the company’s agent. At the second creditors’ meeting, creditors will be asked to vote on whether the company should execute a Deed of Company Arrangement if one is proposed (see below), be wound up (see below) or revert to the control of its directors. That decision is made by the company’s creditors (by a majority in number and value) at a meeting convened by the administrator. If the vote is split between value and number, the administrator who generally chairs the meeting of creditors has a casting vote on the outcome, however the exercise of this power may be subject to review by the Australian Court.

Secured creditors who do not vote in favor of the deed of company arrangement will generally not be bound by its terms. The content of a deed of company arrangement must include the mandatory provisions that are required by the Australian Corporations Act and will depend on the arrangement proposed which is put to vote at the second creditors’ meeting held during the voluntary administration procedure. A deed of company arrangement will generally provide for the restructure or rehabilitation of the company, usually by compromising claims against the company in exchange for a distribution to creditors. It may also provide for the realization of assets, the orderly winding down of the company’s business, the pursuit of litigation for the benefit of creditors and, as stated above, the compromise of claims against the company. It will generally also provide for a moratorium on claims against the company for the period in which the deed of company arrangement operates. A deed of company arrangement can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of the relevant Australian Court, or in certain circumstances by resolution of the company’s creditors. 247 ----- The consequences of termination will depend on the terms of the deed or (if applicable) the Court orders made or the creditors’ resolution. Two common consequences of termination are: - that the company is wound up (for example, if the deed has not been performed, the Court makes orders terminating the deed or the creditors pass a resolution terminating the deed and that the company be wound up); or - that the company returns to the control of its directors and officers (if the deed has been performed).",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Receivers are generally appointed privately by a secured creditor in accordance with the terms of a security document. In certain limited circumstances, receivers may also be appointed by an Australian Court on application of a party seeking to protect its interests. Depending on the extent of the assets securing the company’s obligation to the secured creditor and the terms of the security, the secured creditor will usually have the ability to appoint either a receiver or a receiver and manager. For the purposes of this document, there is no distinction between receivers and receivers and managers, so the term ‘‘receivers’’ is used to describe both types of appointment. A receiver is charged with the realization or management of the secured asset over which he or she has been appointed. Where the terms of the relevant security permit it to do so, a receiver and manager may be empowered to take control of the debtor’s business as a going concern for the purpose of repayment of the secured debt, through realization of the debtor’s assets and/or through the income generated by the debtor’s business. A receiver’s powers are determined by the terms of the security under which she or he is appointed (or in the case of a Court appointed receiver, the relevant Court orders). Receivers’ powers and obligations are also subject to the Australian Corporations Act and general law. Generally, a receiver’s powers will include the power to enter into possession and control of the secured property, lease or sell the secured property, and to carry on the business of the debtor and do all things which the debtor is normally empowered to do. It is common for the document creating the security interest to provide that receivers exercise their powers as agent of the company. As such, while directors and officers of the debtor are not formally displaced by the appointment of a receiver, the powers of the receiver supersede those of the existing company management, in respect of dealing with secured property. The directors may however be required to provide the receiver with reports as to the company’s affairs and to cooperate with the receiver to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes of the receivership. A receivership can occur concurrently with a voluntary administration, deed of company arrangement or a liquidation. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a voluntary administration, the administrator’s powers are subject to the functions and powers of the receiver. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a winding up (or liquidation), the receiver’s powers are not diminished, although the receiver’s agency for the company whilst carrying on the company’s business is subject to the liquidator’s consent or an order of the Australian court. A receiver owes her or his primary duty to the secured creditor who appointed them. However, the Australian Corporations Act also imposes certain statutory duties on a receiver. In particular, s 420A(1) of that Act, obliges receivers to take reasonable care to ensure that, if sold, the secured property is sold for market value (or, if the assets do not have a market value, for the best price reasonably obtainable having regard to the circumstances that exist when the property is sold). Receivers are also officers of the company and therefore, are subject to the officers’ duties imposed by the Australian Corporations Act. In the normal course, a privately-appointed receivership will terminate where the purpose for which the receiver was appointed has been achieved. This will usually be the repayment of the debt owed to the secured creditor. If there are insufficient assets held by the debtor to repay the secured debt in full, the receivership will terminate when the receiver exhausts all of the available assets of the debtor and retires. On termination of the receivership (assuming there is no concurrent voluntary administration, deed of company arrangement or liquidation), control of the company and all of its remaining assets are returned to the company’s directors and officers. 248 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

A winding up most commonly occurs where a company is insolvent, and is commenced: - where a Court makes an order that the company be wound up in insolvency (or for some other reason); - by resolution of the company’s members (known as a creditors’ voluntary winding up if the company is insolvent); or - by resolution of the company’s creditors at the second meeting of creditors in a voluntary administration. It is also possible for a company to be wound up on a solvent basis, most commonly because its members wish it to cease trading and have their capital returned (known as a members’ voluntary winding up). This process requires the directors to sign a solvency declaration in relation to the company. During a winding up: - subject to a Court order, a stay is imposed upon existing proceedings against the company and claimants are prohibited from commencing new proceedings; - instead claimants must lodge a proof of debt with the liquidator for the amount of their claim against the company; and - subject to a Court order, any distress or execution put in force against the property of the company is void. However, a secured creditor does not require the leave of the Court to deal with the charged property. Where a receivership and liquidation occur concurrently, a liquidator will generally not have power to deal with the company’s assets that are the subject of a valid security interest in favor of the secured creditor. On liquidation, unsecured creditors have a right to vote at any creditors’ meetings and are entitled to participate in the distribution of a fund of assets protected and properly administered. Secured creditors generally retain the right to enforce their security and may elect to appoint a receiver. Once appointed, a liquidator is able to bring proceedings, among other things, against persons in relation to ‘‘voidable transactions,’’ pursuant to section 588FE(1) of the Australian Corporations Act. The most commonly prosecuted ‘‘voidable transaction’’ claims, and their relevance to noteholders, are discussed further in the limitations section below. The proceeds of successful claims will be available for distribution to the company’s creditors. After collecting the assets and finalization of the process of calling for proofs of debt and adjudicating those proofs (and the time for receipt of proofs of debt having expired), the liquidator can pay a dividend to creditors. Depending upon the complexity and size of the company, a liquidation can last for several years and the liquidator may declare several dividends over that time. Section 556(1) of the Australian Corporations Act provides a prescribed order (commonly referred to as a ‘‘waterfall’’) for the payment of certain unsecured debts and claims against the company, which must be paid in priority to all other unsecured debts and claims against the company. These include, among others, debts or amounts owing to employees for certain claims. The final step in a winding-up is the deregistration of the company. The steps for deregistration are governed by the Australian Corporations Act. Once deregistered, the company ceases to exist and the liquidator’s role comes to an end.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Schemes can be utilized by companies to provide for a modification or adjustment of the rights of the company’s creditors or members which, if approved by the requisite majority of creditors or members of 249 ----- the class to which the scheme was proposed and approved by the Court, will be binding on all creditors or members in that class (including dissenting creditors or members). In brief, there are two different types of schemes: members’ schemes and creditors’ schemes. Before either type of scheme can be implemented it must be approved the court, ASIC and the members or creditors of the company. Members’ schemes will generally involve some restructuring of the company and the rights and obligations of its members. A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the company’s debts. A typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company and a compromise of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in relation to the company). A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by each class of affected creditors (in each case by a voting majority constituting 75% in value and a simple majority in number). Unlike a deed of company arrangement, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors, owners and lessors in respect of their property and can release certain third-party claims provided there is sufficient nexus between the release and the relationship between the debtor/creditor. Schemes are, however, extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to the rights and obligations of the company and its creditors. However, a scheme which is contrary to law, or not in the public interest is unlikely to be approved by the Court (even if it has the support of members and/or creditors), which has an inherent fairness discretion in relation to the final approval of schemes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1339,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1339.8,Australia,1339.8.6,Summary of Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Collateral Under Australian Law,"_General_ Under Australian law, the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and security interests is subject to various limitations, some of which are summarized below. _Breach of Directors’ Duties_ The decision to provide the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests may be found to have been in breach of the duties owed by the directors of the Australian Guarantors, including the duty to act in good faith in the interests of the Australian Guarantors, and for a proper purpose. If a Court were to find that the directors of the Australian Guarantors breached those duties in connection with providing the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests, they may become voidable. If any of the Guarantees from an Australian Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that Noteholders would be left with a claim solely against the Issuer and the other Guarantors. _Risks Relating to Registration_ Under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the ‘‘PPSA’’), security interests over personal property (as that term is defined in the PPSA) may be susceptible to a loss of priority (or in certain circumstances extinguishment) unless the security interest has attached to the relevant collateral and has been perfected. Perfection will usually occur upon registration of the security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register within the requisite timeframe (but can also be effected by ‘‘possession’’ or ‘‘control’’ of the relevant collateral in some cases). If a security interest is not perfected or is extinguished, a secured party will continue to have an unsecured claim against a grantor upon the appointment of a voluntary administrator or a liquidator to the grantor. The PPSA also sets out detailed rules for priority between security interests over personal property and for the circumstances in which assets may become free from security interests. To the extent that security interests granted by the Australian Guarantors are created over personal property, these rules will apply. The general rule is that security interests rank in order of perfection subject to a number of exceptions, which have general application. For example, a security interest perfected by ‘‘control’’ ranks ahead of other security interests and a purchase money security interest can rank ahead of earlier perfected security interests provided it is registered within a certain time. _Risks Arising in a Winding-Up Voidable transactions_ If an Australian Guarantor is subject to a winding up, the liquidator may apply to an Australian Court for orders that the entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests or a transaction in connection 250 ----- with the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests constitutes a voidable transaction and should be set aside. The most commonly brought voidable transactions claims include the following: - an ‘‘unfair preference,’’ (sections 588FA and 588FC of the Australian Corporations Act) being a transaction between the company and a creditor carried out at a time when the company was insolvent (or the company became insolvent as a result of the transaction) that results in the creditor receiving from the company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than the creditor would receive on a winding up of the company if the transaction were set aside; - an ‘‘uncommercial transaction,’’ (sections 588FB and 588FC of the Australian Corporations Act) being a transaction that a reasonable person in the company’s position would not have entered into, having regard to the benefits and detriment to the company of entering into the transaction, the benefits to the other parties to the transaction of entering into it and any other relevant matters; or - an ‘‘unreasonable director-related transaction’’ or an ‘‘unfair loan’’ (sections 588FDA and 588FD, respectively, of the Australian Corporations Act). _‘‘Green’’ security_ A security interest granted by the company in respect of ‘‘circulating assets’’ in the 6 month period leading up to the liquidator’s appointment or, if the liquidation was preceded by voluntary administration, the commencement of the voluntary administration, will be void except so far as the security interest secures: - a new advance (other than an advance to discharge an unsecured debt owed to the secured party which must be given as consideration for the circulating security interest); - interest on such an advance; - the amount of a liability (e.g. under a guarantee) undertaken at or after that time on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company; or - an amount payable for property services supplied to the company at or after that time or interest on an amount so payable. The security interest will not be void if the company is proven to have been solvent immediately after the time it granted the security interest. _Impact of the above on entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests_ The extent to which the entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests is susceptible to challenge on the bases set out above depends, among other things, on when the relevant transaction was entered into relative to the commencement of the winding up (or, if a voluntary administration precedes the winding up, the commencement of the voluntary administration). Different time periods apply depending on the circumstances of the relevant transaction and the identity and relationship of the parties to it. _Ipso facto reforms_ On 18 September 2017, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No.2) Act 2017 (the ‘‘TLA Act’’) was enacted in Australia. With effect from 1 July 2018, this legislation introduced new provisions into the Australian Corporations Act, which provide for an automatic stay on the enforcement of certain rights and self-executing provisions (known as ‘‘ipso facto’’ rights) arising under certain contracts (such as a right entitling a creditor to terminate the contract or to accelerate payments or providing for automatic acceleration), if the reason for the enforcement of those rights or provisions is (a) the contractual counterparty being under voluntary administration, having a managing controller appointed over the whole or substantially the whole of its property, or announcing, applying for or being the subject of a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of it avoiding being wound up in insolvency), (b) the contractual counterparty’s financial position during any of those affected procedures or (c) a reason that is in substance contrary to the provisions inserted by the TLA Act (known as ‘‘prescribed reasons’’). Notably, the procedures under which the automatic stay would apply do not include being subject to winding up or liquidation (unless those processes are consequent to a voluntary administration or a scheme) or where a 251 ----- deed of company arrangement has been executed (unless the deed administrators obtain a court order for a stay to operate). The automatic stay applies to ipso facto rights arising under contracts, agreements or arrangements entered into at or after 1 July 2018, subject to certain exclusions set out in the Corporations Act, subordinate regulations and a Declaration related to the provisions inserted by the TLA Act that also came into effect on 1 July 2018. The subordinate regulations prescribe that a right contained in a kind of contract, agreement or arrangement for the underwriting of an issue, or sale, of bonds or that is, or governs, bonds, is not subject to the automatic stay. Rights exercised with the consent of the relevant administrator, managing controller (which includes a receiver or receiver and manager), scheme administrator (or a liquidator if a liquidation follows the administration or scheme) and the right to appoint a controller (in respect of security over the whole or substantially the whole property) during the decision period following the appointment of administrators are excluded. In addition to the exclusions currently applicable as a result of related subordinate regulations and the Declaration that came into effect on 1 July 2018, rights prescribed by regulations or Ministerial declarations following 1 July 2018 may also be excluded. Any such subordinate legislation that may be implemented following 1 July 2018 may also prescribe additional reasons to which the automatic stay on enforcement applies. The legislation also gives the Court the power to impose stay orders in respect of a potentially broader range of contractual rights (where the court is satisfied that the relevant right is being exercised, is likely to be exercised or there is a threat that it might be exercised because of one of the prescribed reasons described above), lift the automatic stay (where the court is satisfied that doing so is in the interests of justice) and extend the duration of the automatic stay. In relation to the Australian Guarantor, the effect of the ipso facto reforms means that, in the event of the Australian Guarantor being subject to voluntary administration, a managing controllership over the whole or substantially the whole of its property or a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of avoiding it being wound up in insolvency), but not winding up or liquidation (unless those processes are consequent to a voluntary administration or a scheme) or where a deed of company arrangement has been executed (unless the deed administrators obtain a court order for a stay to operate), the rights of any counterparty to a contract with the Australian Guarantor that would otherwise be triggered by those events (or triggered by its financial position whilst affected by one of those affected procedures) may be stayed during the period whilst those processes are underway. This may affect the exercise of rights under the Guarantees as against the Australian Guarantor. Until there has been judicial consideration of the new provisions of the Australian Corporations Act as introduced by the TLA Act, the subordinate regulations and the Declaration, the scope of the ipso facto reform and its potential effect on the Notes and Guarantees remains uncertain. 252 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The regime is intended to provide eligible Australian incorporated small businesses with access to a ‘debtor-in-possession’ restructuring process in which a restructuring plan can be proposed to deal with creditor claims. The process is available to companies which meet the eligibility criteria, the most significant of which is that the company’s liabilities are less than AUD$1 million, including secured and related-party debt, but excluding employee entitlements.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.1,England and Wales,215.1.1,,"The United States and England currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilize any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. 270 ----- Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

According to Article 3.2 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, the Spanish Government may establish that the Spanish authorities will not cooperate with another country’s authorities where there has been a refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other country’s authorities. Additionally, article 47 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act provides for a special provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in proceedings resulting from collective action, which may be recognized and enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the conditions set forth therein. 271 ----- The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain, which would not directly be recognized or enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera _Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) for which the foregoing requirements must be_ met. The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. A final and conclusive judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation number 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters would be recognized and enforceable by the Spanish courts, without review of its merits. The enforcement of any judgments in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain court fees must be paid, and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (e) the content and validity of foreign law, if needed, must be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could, again, entail certain costs). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Consequently, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the party in whose favor a final and conclusive judgment of the U.S. court has been rendered will be required to file its claim with a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands. Such party may submit to the Dutch court the final judgment rendered by the U.S. court. The Dutch court will have discretion to attach such weight to the judgment rendered by the relevant U.S. court as it deems appropriate. Dutch courts can, under current practice, be expected to give conclusive effect to a final and enforceable judgment of such court in respect of the contractual obligations thereunder without substantive re-examination or re-litigation of the substantive matters adjudicated upon (marginale toetsing), provided that: (i) the U.S. court involved accepted jurisdiction on the basis of internationally recognized grounds to accept jurisdiction, (ii) the proceedings before such court have been conducted in compliance with generally accepted principles of fair trial and proper procedure (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) such judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iv) such judgment not being incompatible with a judgment rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with a prior judgment rendered by a foreign court between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided such prior judgment fulfills the conditions necessary for it to be given binding effect in the Netherlands, and (v) the foreign judgment is— according to the law of its country of origin—formally capable of being enforced (e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not been subject to a certain time frame), but the court will in either case have discretion to attach such weight to the judgment of any federal or state court in the United States as it deems appropriate and may re-examine or re-litigate the substantive matters adjudicated upon. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other awards. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement of any foreign judgment in the Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 272 ----- Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Dutch law. Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that those judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

In addition, no assurance can be made as to whether or not an Australian court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in Australia and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In order to enforce a United States judgment in Australia: - the judgment creditor must rely on common law principles in Australia by commencing fresh proceedings in an Australian court to sue for the judgment amount as a debt, or by bringing a cause of action based on the original cause of action relying on the foreign judgment to estop the judgment creditor from raising any defense; and - each of the following conditions must be satisfied: (i) the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive, in that it must end the proceeding and the dispute to which the proceeding relates and the matter was not the subject of an earlier final and conclusive judgment by another court having jurisdiction; (ii) the parties to the U.S. judgment must be identical to the parties to the Australian enforcement proceeding; (iii) the U.S. judgment must be for a fixed, or readily calculable, sum and not in the nature of a tax, foreign revenue debt, fine or penalty imposed by U.S. (or any foreign) law; (iv) the U.S. Court giving the judgment did not lack jurisdiction to give the judgment; (v) the U.S. Court must have exercised jurisdiction which is recognized under Australian conflict of law rules—this requirement will usually be satisfied where the judgment debtor was ordinarily resident or present in the U.S. at the time the proceeding was served, or otherwise voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court; (vi) the U.S. judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and enforcement must only be sought to the extent the judgment is not satisfied); and (vii) the enforcement proceeding must have been commenced within any applicable limitation periods. The party bringing the application must advance sufficient evidence of these elements. Under common law principles in Australia, a defense will be available against the enforcement of a U.S. judgment in Australia if: - the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud or duress; - enforcement of the U.S. judgment would contravene Australian public policy; - the judgment debtor was denied natural justice or fairness before the U.S. court (for example, if they did not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable them to defend the case); - enforcement of the U.S. judgment in Australia would amount to the enforcement of a U.S. penal or revenue law; or 273 ----- - there is a prior judgment in another court between the same parties concerning the same issues as are dealt with in the U.S. judgment.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1972,BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,1972.1,,1972.1.1,,"Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: - the fair value of the consideration transferred; less - the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs related to acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, are expensed as incurred. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

This is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investments are initially recognised in the F-23 ----- Balance Sheet at cost and thereafter adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in value. The carrying values of investments in associates include any acquired goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. If the Group’s share of losses in an associate exceeds its investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on behalf of the associate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487
250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1974,INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES HELD BY THE COMPANY,1974.1,Goodwill,1974.1.1,,"Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the cost of a business acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of acquisition. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which management controls the related cash flows. Goodwill with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rate to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. If the impairment is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount, except in the case of goodwill, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, limited to the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised previously. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding VAT, trade discounts and rebates in accordance with IFRS 15. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at a point in time when promised goods have been transferred to a customer at which point the performance obligation is considered to have been satisfied. The customer is considered to obtain control of the promised goods at the point of delivery. The standalone selling price of the product sold to a customer is clearly determined from the contract entered into. The total transaction price is estimated as the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods after deducting trade discounts and volume rebates which create variability in the transaction price. In determining the variable consideration to be recognised, trade discounts and volume rebates are estimated based on the terms of the contractually agreed arrangements and the amount of consideration to which the group will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. Variable consideration is estimated using the ‘most likely amount’ method.

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Payments made to state managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. (b) Defined benefit schemes Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which F-26 ----- the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1974,INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES HELD BY THE COMPANY,1974.15,Taxation,1974.15.1,,"Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In respect of IFRS 16 leases, each lease is considered as a single transaction in which the asset and liability are linked so that there is no net temporary difference at inception and subsequently deferred tax is recognised on the net temporary difference arising on settlement of the liability and the amortisation of the right of use asset plus the finance charge on the lease liability. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Depreciation on buildings is charged to profit or loss. Other fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does F-28 ----- not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

This facility has been accounted for using split accounting to recognise separate debt and equity components. The warrant was redeemed in November 2017. During the year, payment of the BGF redemption premium was deferred from December 2019 to December 2021. The debt component is recognised on the date of inception or modification at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity element is recognised as the difference between the fair value of the financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the equity and debt components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts. Subsequently, the debt component is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. In September 2017 the terms of the BGF loan agreement were modified. The changes to the loan agreement were determined to give rise to a substantial modification, and as such has been accounted for under IFRS9 ‘extinguishment accounting’. In adopting extinguishment accounting the Group has: - De-recognised the existing liability and recognised a new liability at fair value. - Recognised a gain or loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the old liability and the fair value of the new liability. The unamortised element of the transactions costs from the original loan have also been included in the determination of the gain or loss. - Calculated a new effective interest rate for the modified liability which will be used in future periods. In November 2017 the BGF exercised the share option in full, acquiring 3,730,000 shares.

The plan involves the issue of up to 100,000 ordinary shares in Victoria Midco Holdings Limited. The Plan will operate for a five year period, with the value of the Incentive Shares linked to cumulative Total Shareholder Return (‘‘TSR’’) delivered each year above a hurdle, being the current market capitalisation of the Company increased annually by 20% p.a. on a compounding basis (i.e. within each annual period shareholders have to receive a return of 20% before the participants benefit from the Plan). At the end of the Plan, the Incentive Shares can be exchanged for new ordinary shares in Victoria, (at the then prevailing share price averaged over the month prior to exchange). While the Company has the ability to buy back Incentive Shares after 3 years (it is not anticipated that this right will be exercised), participants can only choose to exchange at the end of the full five-year period of the Plan. Customary good and bad leaver provisions will apply. On 10 April 2018, the Group issued 73,855 I shares (‘I1 Shares’). On 1 April 2019, a further 4,350 I shares were issued (‘I2 Shares’).

The Group has also applied the practical expedient in IFRS16 to not reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application. The Group’s results have been impacted by the adoption of IFRS 16, which introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognised. A lessee now recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. At the start of the current accounting period, on 31 March 2019, the Group recognised an initial right-of-use asset of £56.1m and liability of £57.3m. The lease liability on transition has been calculated based on the net present value of the future expected capital payments under the group’s lease obligations discounted at the group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 31 March 2019. The right of use asset has been calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for prepaid and accrued lease payments as at 31 March 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at the date of initial application is 3.8%. As a result of adopting IFRS 16, Group PBT for the period was adversely impacted by £1.0m. Charges relating to operating leases (£10.9m), which previously were recognised on a straight-line basis have been replaced with a depreciation charge (£9.3m) to the right-of-use asset, plus an interest expense (£2.6m) representing the unwinding of discount on the lease liability. The interest follows a logarithmic profile resulting in a higher initial charge, and reduces over the period of the lease. This change in treatment has no impact on the cash flows of the business.

These businesses are the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and represent cash generating units (‘‘CGUs’’). The CGUs within a reported segment share similar characteristics to each other and to the other businesses within that segment. Previously CGUs were determined to be individual acquisitions which had been made historically, however in the current year these were reassessed in light of an increasing amount of integration, both in terms of operations and management. Consequently, the cash flows of each individual business are no longer distinguishable and as a result, the CGUs assessed in 2020 are aligned to the group reporting divisions, with the exception of the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles division’. This division is split between a CGU representing the Spanish operations and a CGU representing the Italian operations, which are distinct from one another in terms of geography and, to an extent, management. The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. These assumptions have been sensitised as part of current year testing procedures. The discount rates used of: 12% for the ‘UK & Europe—Soft Flooring’ CGU; 13.5% for the Spanish part of the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles’ CGU; 13.25% for the Italian part of the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles’ CGU; and 13.9% for the ‘Australia’ CGU are estimated using pre-tax weighted-average costs of capital that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money, based on risks specific to the markets in which the businesses operate.

The calculation uses cash flow projections extrapolated from the budget for the year ending March 2021. At the end of the discrete forecast period, a terminal value is calculated based on terminal growth rate assumptions of: 2.25% for the ‘UK & Europe— Soft Flooring’ CGU; 1.3% for the Spanish part of the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles’ CGU; 1.75% for the Italian part of the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles’ CGU; and 2.75% for the ‘Australia’ CGU. Primarily as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated uncertainties, we have reduced our forecast assumptions and the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs were reduced. As a consequence, the ‘UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles (Spain) CGU was assessed to have a recoverable amount of £478.3m, being its value in use. In calculating the value in use, a discount rate of 13.5% and a terminal growth rate of 1.3% were applied. As the value in use was lower than the carrying value of its assets, an impairment to goodwill of £50.0m was recognised, and charged through the income statement during the period. If a discount rate of 0.5% higher had been used, the resulting impairment implied would have been greater by £19.9m; whereas if a discount rate of 0.5% lower had been used, the resulting impairment implied would have been lower by £21.6m. No reasonably possible changes in assumptions in the value in use calculations for the other CGUs would generate an impairment. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing workforce.

As part of the Keraben acquisition terms, the senior management team were required to invest A8.3m into a performance plan linked to the financial results of the target business over a five year period. The value of this plan can go up or down from the original A8.3m subscription, depending on performance. Customary leaver provisions apply during the five year period.

250,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1983,16. OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES,1983.3,Notes to the accounts (Continued) 16. OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (Continued),1983.3.1,,"Senior debt as at 28 March 2020 relates to A500m of 2024 senior secured notes, on which a coupon of 5.25% is paid bi-annually. The notes were issued in two tranches during the year, with the first tranche (A330m) issued at par and the second (A170m) at a 5% premium. As such, on issuance of the second tranche the Company received incremental proceeds of A8.5m, which was recognised within the opening value of the liability, and is reduced to Anil at maturity when only the par value (A170m) is repayable. As at 28 March 2020 this premium is recognised on the balance sheet at £7.5m. The fair value of the liability as at 28 March was A388.6m, which has been determined based on a quoted price in an active market. Attached to the notes is an early repayment option, which has been identified as an embedded derivative asset, separately valued from the host contract. Changes in the Group’s credit rating and market pricing of the notes would have an impact on the value of the option for early repayment. The redemption price of the repayment option is the par value of the notes plus any accrued interest, plus the following premia: within the first two years 2.625% plus a make-whole of the fair value of interest that would otherwise have been payable in that period; in the third year 2.625%; in the fourth year 1.3125%; in the fifth year 0%. This option has been valued based on the contractual redemption terms and measuring the Group’s forward assessment of the notes’ market value based on an option pricing model. The value of the derivative asset at inception of the first and second tranches of the notes was £2.0m and £5.0m, respectively. The value of the liability recognised for the notes was increased by a corresponding amount, which is then reduced to par (A500m) at maturity in 2024 using a effective interest rate method. As a result, as at 28 March 2020 there is a total liability recognised of £452.9m in relation to notes with a par value of £448.4m (A500m) repayable in 2024, which includes an additional liability of £6.8m arising as a result of the embedded derivative recognition and £7.5m relating to the premium on the second tranche. The value of the derivative asset at the year end was £nil, and therefore an associated non-cash charge was recognised through the income statement for the period of £7.3m. Additionally, the Group has a variable rate £75m multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing in 2024, which at the year end was drawn in full. The prior year A445m term loan provided by Barclays & HSBC was refinanced in the current year with the senior notes. The unsecured loans relate to a loan of £1.5m owed to the vendors of the G-tuft business, and the debt component of the BGF loan on which the coupon is 6%. During the year, payment of the BGF redemption premium was deferred from December 2019 to December 2021, resulting in a non-underlying financial income of £0.2m (see Note 3). The Group’s net debt position as at 28 March 2020 was £378.6m (2019: £339.9m), before inclusion of right-of-use lease liabilities and netting off prepaid finance costs. This figure includes the above £6.8m in relation to the early repayment option on the notes and £7.5m relating to the 5% issue premium on the second tranche of the notes. The contractual maturities of financial liabilities and average effective interest rates are set out in Note 26. F-54 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (Continued) Fair value measurement of financial instruments,1983.17.1,,"Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement as follows: - Level one: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level two: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly - Level three: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities All financial assets and liabilities have been identified as Level one with the exception of: - Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are Level two financial assets/liabilities and all expire within 12 months from 28 March 2020. The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for complex valuations of the forward exchange contracts. Valuation techniques have utilised observable forward exchange rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts. - Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities. The fair value of the contingent earn-out liabilities arising from acquisitions is determined considering the value of estimated future payments, discounted to present value. Payments are determined by mechanisms set out in each acquisition agreement, and are generally based on EBITDA performance over a three to four year period. Estimated future payments are calculated using financial projections based on operational budgets for the next 12 months and then applying growth assumptions for future years as appropriate. Discount rates are reviewed annually for each acquisition, and range between 11.5% and 18.5%. The most significant inputs, all of which are unobservable, are the estimated growth rates in future profits and the discount rates applied. The estimated fair value increases if the estimated growth rates increase or the discount rates decrease. The overall valuations are sensitive to both assumptions. The Board considers that changing the above unobservable inputs to reflect other reasonably probable alternative assumptions would not result in a significant change in the estimated fair value. There were no transfers between level one, level two and level three in 2020 or 2019. F-58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The last full actuarial valuations of these schemes were carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 July 2018. The contributions made by the employer over the financial period were £136,000 (2019: £95,000) in respect of the Main Scheme and £nil (2019: £126,000) in respect of the Executive Scheme. Contributions to the Executive and Main Schemes are made in accordance with the Schedule of Contributions. Future contributions are expected to be an annual premium of £136,000 in respect of the Main Scheme and £nil contributions payable to the Executive Scheme.

OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES,1983.60,(b) Ascot Gruppo Ceramiche S.R.L.,1983.60.1,,"On 1 March 2020, Victoria PLC entered into an arrangement to lease the business and manufacturing facilities of Ascot for seven years, with an associated option to purchase the business. During the course of FY20, the Group explored opportunities to expand the production capacity for its Italian ceramic tiles operations, where demand consistently exceeded the maximum manufacturing output of the existing business Ceramiche Serra. Operating in Sassuolo, Italy, Ascot is located close to Serra. It manufactures high quality porcelain ceramic flooring, which is sold both domestically and internationally. It sells to a combination of wholesalers, retail groups, and independent stores throughout Continental Europe. With excess capacity and the ability to leverage operational synergies, Ascot provides a solution to the above capacity constraint issue. Despite the arrangement being structured as a lease with option to purchase, as the Group has full control of the business and assets of Ascot and intends to exercise the option to acquire, the transaction meets the criteria for business combination accounting under IFRS3. The total consideration is A11.5m (£9.9m), all of which is deferred on completion, with payments being made over the period of the lease up to the point at which the option to acquire is exercised. The option is exercisable at any time for no cost, subject to the full remaining balance of the full A11.5m being paid. While there is no initial payment, under the agreement, the vendors have some flexibility over the timings of the deferred consideration payments, albeit an adjustment for cost of capital applies if drawn early. For the year ended 31 December 2018, Ascot reported revenues of A67.1m (£58.6m[1]) and operating profit of A2.3m (£2.0m[1]). This is clearly a period prior to the signing of the lease arrangement and therefore does not include any of the aforementioned capacity benefits for the Group. The Group results for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2020 include contribution from Ascot of A4.8m (£4.2m[1]) of revenue and A0.4m (£0.3m[1]) of profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs).",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,1984.8,Credit risk,1984.8.1,,"The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are obtained from reputable external sources. Furthermore, in specific areas where a heightened credit risk is perceived, credit insurance is utilised to help mitigate this risk. A review of credit risk by customer category was undertaken in light of historical rates of credit loss overlaid with the heightened risk of potential economic fallout from Covid-19. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical locations. Furthermore, specific trade receivables are written-off when there is considered to be little likelihood of recovering the debt. Further to the above review in light of Covid-19, the Group’s credit loss provision was increased by £1.0m to account for the heightened risk. The group continues to monitor its exposure to expected credit losses and further disclosure will be provided in future periods if the Group’s assessment changes. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the performances of which are closely monitored.

To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days.

The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. On an annual basis the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill balances are less than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance.

Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty rates and customer attrition.

Consequently, the date of initial recognition was considered to be the date of drawdown, as opposed to the date of commitment. As a result of applying the loan commitment scope exclusion, as above, it was deemed appropriate to base the value of the combined instrument on the proceeds as agreed at the earlier commitment date. It was deemed appropriate that for the purpose of calculating the host as the residual that, in light of the loan commitment scope exclusion applied, the embedded option should only be recognised on drawdown and therefore that its initial carrying value should be the fair value at that date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS,1987.15,An overview of the scope of our audit,1987.15.1,,"Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business, its environment and risk profile. The components of the Group were evaluated by the Group audit team based on a measure of materiality, considering each as a percentage of the Group’s total assets, revenues and profit before taxation, to assess the significance of the component to determine the planned audit response. A full-scope audit approach for all components evaluated as significant was determined based on their relative materiality to the Group and our assessment of the audit risk. For significant components requiring a full-scope approach we or the component auditors evaluated the controls over the financial reporting system identified as part of our risk assessment, reviewed the financial statement production process and addressed critical accounting matters. For all significant risks identified we documented our understanding of management’s process for evaluating the applicable risk and assessed the design effectiveness of related key controls. We sought, wherever possible, to rely on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls in order to reduce substantive testing. We then undertook substantive testing on significant transactions and material account balances. In order to address the described audit risks identified during our planning procedures, the Group audit team performed a full-scope audit of the financial statements of the Company, Victoria PLC (in the United Kingdom), and of other significant component entities in the United Kingdom, and component F-86 ----- auditors performed a full-scope audit of the financial statements of other significant components in Spain, Italy and Australia. The operations that were subject to full-scope audit procedures totalled 88.6 percent of consolidated revenues and 94.1 percent of consolidated underlying profit before taxation.

We also determined that targeted procedures were to be carried out by the Group audit team in respect of certain entities based in the Netherlands and United Kingdom where significant assessed risks of material misstatement had been identified. The remaining operations of the Group were subjected to analytical procedures with a focus on the audit risks identified above and the significance to the Group’s balances. Detailed audit instructions were issued to the component auditors of the reporting components where a full-scope approach had been identified. The instructions highlighted the significant risks to be addressed through the audit procedures and detailed the information that we required to be reported to the Group audit team.

Staff costs (Continued) Share based payment schemes B Shares and C Shares schemes,1987.58.1,,"On 29 April 2016, the Group Finance Director, Michael Scott, was awarded 5,000 B ordinary shares (the ‘‘B Shares’’) in a new intermediate holding company, Victoria Midco Holdings Limited, in connection with a share-based incentive plan as recommended by the Remuneration Committee. Between the second and third anniversary of his joining the company, Mr Scott is able to exchange the B Shares into ordinary shares in Victoria PLC (‘‘Ordinary Shares’’) of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award represents approximately 0.611% of the growth in value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of £3.00. On 7 June 2018, Mr Scott exercised his option, exchanging the 5,000 B Shares for 395,476 Ordinary Shares in Victoria Plc. In the year ended 30 March 2019, no further B shares were granted and no B share options remained outstanding. On 8 June 2017, Mr Scott was awarded 5,350 C ordinary shares and certain other employees 1,070 C ordinary shares (collectively the ‘‘C Shares’’) in connection with the share-based incentive plan. Between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 participants will be able to exchange C Shares into Ordinary Shares of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award represents approximately 0.733% of the growth in value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of £6.75. The Plan is subject to good leaver and bad leaver provisions. In the year ended 30 March 2019, none of the C shares were exercisable, no additional C shares were granted and all of the existing 6,420 C shares remained in place. The B and C Shares have been valued for the purposes of IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) using a Black Scholes model.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS,1987.60,I Shares scheme,1987.60.1,,"On 10 April 2018, a new long-term incentive plan was introduced to incentivise senior employees. The plan involves the issue of up to 100,000 ordinary shares in Victoria Midco Holdings Limited. The Plan will operate for a five year period, with the value of the Incentive Shares linked to cumulative Total Shareholder Return (‘‘TSR’’) delivered each year above a hurdle, being the current market capitalisation of the Company increased annually by 20% p.a. on a compounding basis (i.e. within each annual period shareholders have to receive a return of 20% before the participants benefit from the Plan). At the end of the Plan, the Incentive Shares can be exchanged for new ordinary shares in Victoria, (at the then prevailing share price averaged over the month prior to exchange).

The fair value of the I shares are charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the scheme, which is expected to be 5.4 years, with a corresponding credit to equity as the charge is non-cash. The expected volatility assumption has been determined with consideration to the historical share price volatility over a period commensurate with the expected maximum term of the I shares and the historical volatility of industry comparator companies.

UK & Europe—Ceramic Tiles **38.7** — 223.7** 188.1 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. These assumptions have been sensitised as part of current year testing procedures. The discount rates used of: 11.1% to 12.0% for CGUs within the UK; 12.0% to 12.7% for CGUs within Holland; 12.0% to 13.0% for CGUs within Spain; 12.2% to 13.2% for CGUs within Italy; and 13.6% to 14.6% for CGUs within Australia are estimated using pre-tax weighted-average costs of capital that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money, based on risks specific to the markets in which the businesses operate. The primary reasons for the difference in the rates between the UK, Europe and Australia are the differences in underlying risk-free rates and cost of debt. The calculation uses cash flow projections extrapolated from the budget for the year ending 28 March 2020. At the end of the discrete forecast period, a terminal value is calculated based on terminal growth rate assumptions of: 2.0% to 2.5% for CGUs within the UK; 2.5% to 3.0% for CGUs within Australia; and 2.0% to 2.5% for CGUs within Continental Europe. Given the sensitivities used in testing, the Group does not consider it probable that any reasonable changes to the key assumptions would result in impairment to any of the Goodwill balances. As at 30 March 2019 no impairment provision was therefore considered necessary. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

All of the schemes assets have a quoted market price in an active market. The actual return on plan assets was £1,671,000 (2018: £1,551,000). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. If the discount rate decreased by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 4.6%. If the rate of inflation increases by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 3.5%. F-122 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Financial assets and liabilities (Continued) Fair value measurement of financial instruments,1987.120.1,,"Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement as follows: - Level one: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level two: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indrectly - Level three: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities All financial assets and liabilities have been identified as Level one with the exception of: - Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are Level two financial assets/liabilities and all expire within 12 months from 30 March 2019. The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for complex valuations of the forward exchange contracts. Valuation techniques have utilised observable forward exchange rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts. - Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities. The fair value of the contingent earn-out liabilities arising from acquisitions is determined considering the value of estimated future payments, discounted to present value. Payments are determined by mechanisms set out in each acquisition agreement, and are generally based on EBITDA performance over a three to four year period. Estimated future payments are calculated using financial projections based on operational budgets for the next 12 months and then applying growth assumptions for future years as appropriate. Discount rates are reviewed annually for each acquisition, and range between 11.5% and 18.5%. The most significant inputs, all of which are unobservable, are the estimated growth rates in future profits and the discount rates applied. The estimated fair value increases if the estimated growth rates increase or the discount rates decrease. The overall valuations are sensititve to both assumptions. The Board considers that changing the above unobservable inputs to reflect other reasonably probable alternative assumptions would not result in a significant change to the estimated fair value. Any reasonably probable improvement in business performance is unlikely to give rise to a material change to the fair value of these liabilities. While we don’t expect a decline in business performance, this would likely give rise to a significant reduction in the fair values of these liabilities. Details of assumptions used in this review are detailed in Note 9. There were no transfers between level one, level two and level three in 2019 or 2018. F-115 ----- Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy.

The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for complex valuations of the forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contract. Valuation techniques have utilised observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts and the interest rate swap contract. - Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities.

Staff costs (Continued) Share based payment schemes,1987.262.1,,"On April 29, 2016, the Group Finance Director, Michael Scott, was awarded 5,000 B ordinary shares (the ‘‘B Shares’’) in a new intermediate holding company, Victoria Midco Holdings Limited, in connection with a share-based incentive plan as recommended by the Remuneration Committee. Between the second and third anniversary of his joining the Company, Mr Scott is able to exchange the B Shares into ordinary shares in Victoria PLC (‘‘Ordinary Shares’’) of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award represents approximately 0.611% of the growth in value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of £3.00. Since the year end, Mr Scott has exercised his option, exchanging the B Shares for 395,476 Ordinary Shares. On June 8, 2017, Mr Scott was awarded 5,350 C ordinary shares and certain other employees 1,070 C ordinary shares (collectively the ‘‘C Shares’’) in connection with the share-based incentive plan. Between the July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 participants will be able to exchange the C Shares into Ordinary Shares of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award represents approximately 0.733% of the growth in value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of £6.75. The Plan is subject to good leaver and bad leaver provisions. The B and C Shares have been valued for the purposes of IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) using a Black Scholes model.

UK & Europe **14.9** — 188.1** 59.8 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. The discount rates used of 10.4% for CGUs within the UK; 9.1% for CGUs within Holland; 10.4% for CGUs within Spain; 12.7% for CGUs within Italy; and 11% for CGUs within Australia are estimated using weighted-average costs of capital that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the markets in which the businesses operate. The primary reasons for the difference in the rates between the UK, Europe and Australia are the differences in underlying risk-free rates and cost of debt. The calculation uses cash flow projections extrapolated for five years from the budget for the year ending March 30, 2019. Mid-term growth rates in EBITDA are estimated at 4% for CGUs within the UK; 4% for CGUs within Australia; and 7% for CGUs within Continental Europe. At the end of the discrete forecast period, a terminal value is calculated based on a terminal growth rate assumption of 2.0%. The Group does not consider it probable that any reasonable changes to the key assumptions would result in impairment to any of the Goodwill balances. As at March 31, 2018 no impairment provision was therefore considered necessary. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

Both facilities mature on October 15, 2020, and are secured by way of debenture over the assets of the Group. The Subordinated loans relate to the debt component of the BGF loan and option instruments. During the year there was a significant modification to the terms of the loan, on which the coupon was reduced from 10% to 6% in September 2017. A corresponding extinguishment charge of £705,000 and release of prepaid costs of £210,000 have been charged to finance costs within the income statement (see Note 3). The Group’s net debt position as at March 31, 2018 was £258.7m (2017: £89.6m), before netting off prepaid finance costs.

POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS,1987.385,Estimates Measurement of intangible assets,1987.385.1,,"Intangible assets are recognised on acquisitions in relation to customer relationships, brands and developed technology. The fair value of these assets are determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset where no active market for the assets exists. These are assessed based upon management forecasts for each business in question. Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty rates and customer attrition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

Recognition therefore involves assessment of the future performance of the particular legal entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax assets in respect of losses recognised at the balance sheet date are based on the assumption that there is a high expectation that the asset will be realised in due course.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The fair value of the growth shares is based on growth in the share price of Victoria PLC above a hurdle and is measured using appropriate valuation model (Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo) at grant date. Key assumptions include expected volatility and the expected exercise period. The growth shares awarded effectively track the market capitalisation of the Company, therefore historical share price volatility has been used as a guide to the expected future volatility of the growth shares. As the fair value of the share based payment charge is spread on a straight line basis to the income statement over the expected term this estimate impacts the annual charge recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,487

The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. On an annual basis the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill, investments or intercompany balances are less than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance.
