(2) either:

(a) you and any customers you represent are QIBs; or

-----

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market:** Solely for the purposes of the
product approval process of the Manufacturers, as defined in the Purchase Agreement (as defined herein),
the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties (‘‘ECPs’’) and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a ‘‘Distributor’’) should take into
consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either
adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined herein) retail investors:** The securities described in the attached
Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the ‘‘PRIIPs
**Regulation’’), for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in**
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the
laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the
Offering Memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires
that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers (as defined in the
attached Offering Memorandum) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in
that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on
behalf of the respective Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of,
these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, the
Group (each term, as defined in the attached Offering Memorandum), any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or
responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to
you in electronic form and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

#### Victoria PLC
##### E450,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2023


Victoria PLC, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the ‘‘Issuer’’), is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) A450,000,000
aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the
‘‘Indenture’’) to be dated on or about, 2018 (the ‘‘Issue Date’’), among, inter alios, the Issuer, HSBC Corporate Trustee Company
(UK) Limited, as trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’), and Barclays Bank PLC, as security agent (the ‘‘Security Agent’’).

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date, payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on
, 2019. The Notes will mature on, 2023. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or
after, 2020 at the redemption prices set forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the ‘‘Offering Memorandum’’). At any time
prior to, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as described in
this Offering Memorandum. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem on one or more occasions up to 40% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes (as defined herein)) using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption; provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) remains outstanding
after the redemption. Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) during each 12-month period commencing on the Issue Date at its option, from time to time, at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. The Issuer may also
redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the
Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer
and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of such Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.’’ Upon the
occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of Notes may require the Issuer to
repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at the purchase prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control’’ and ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’_

The Notes will be the senior obligation of the Issuer and, on the Issue Date, will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the ‘‘Guarantees’’ and, each, a
‘‘Guarantee’’) by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (collectively, the ‘‘Guarantors,’’ and each of them, a ‘‘Guarantor’’). Subject to the terms of the
security documents, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests over certain shares and assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors (collectively, the ‘‘Collateral’’). The Notes and the Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and
future indebtedness of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees, as
applicable, including debt incurred under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as defined herein), and will rank senior in right of payment
to any existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment. The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all
of the existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not also secure the Notes and the
Guarantees, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally
subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of
the security interests over the Collateral, creditors under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations, if any, will be repaid with the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The security interests in the
Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Collateral may be pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances. The validity and
enforceability of the Guarantees and the security and the liability of the Guarantors and security providers will be subject to the limitations described
in ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the
London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market (the ‘‘Exchange’’). The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of
Directive 2014/65/EU. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be
granted or that such listing will be maintained. Settlement of the Notes is not conditional on such admission. The Exchange is a market designated for
professional investors. Securities admitted to trading on the Exchange are not admitted to the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority.
The London Stock Exchange has not approved or verified the contents of this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes in book-entry form. The Issuer expects that the Notes will be deposited and
registered in the name of a nominee for a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (‘‘Euroclear’’) and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(‘‘Clearstream’’) on or about the Issue Date. Interests in a global note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited
circumstances. See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 33.**

**Issue Price:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date**


**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’), or**
**the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons**
**except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. In the United States,**
**this offering is being made only to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in compliance with Rule 144A**
**under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’). You are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) of the Notes may be relying on the**
**exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. Outside of the United States, this offering is being made to**
**non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’). See ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’ and**

process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has
led ECPs to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is ECPs and professional clients only,
each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any Distributor should take into
consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting
or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors._** The Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to and should
not be offered or sold to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the
‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive
2003/71/EC (as amended, the ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’). No key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

**_Australia._** This Offering Memorandum is not, and is not intended to be, a disclosure document within the
meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) of Australia (‘‘Australian Corporations Act’’). No action has
been taken by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes in
Australia. This Offering Memorandum has not been, and no prospectus or other disclosure document (as
defined in the Australian Corporations Act) in relation to the Notes has been or will be, lodged with the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘‘ASIC’’). Accordingly, no offer or invitation for
applications for the issue, sale or purchase of the Notes may be made in Australia (including an offer or
invitation which is received by a person in Australia) and no draft, preliminary or definitive prospectus,
offering circular, disclosure document, advertisement or other offering material relating to the Notes may
be distributed or published in Australia unless:

- the aggregate consideration payable on acceptance of the offer or invitation by each offeree or invitee
is at least AUD $500,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies, but disregarding moneys lent by the
offeror or its associates) or the offer or invitation otherwise does not require disclosure to investors in
accordance with Parts 6D.2 or 7.9 of the Australian Corporations Act;

- such action does not require any document to be lodged with ASIC or any other regulatory authority
in Australia;

- the offer or invitation is not made to a person who is a ‘‘retail client’’ within the meaning of
section 761G of the Australian Corporations Act; and

- the offer, invitation or distribution complies with all applicable laws, regulations and directives in
Australia relating to the offer, sale and resale of the Notes in Australia and in the jurisdiction in which
such offer, sale and resale occurs.

You have been sent this offering circular on the basis that, amongst other matters, if you are a resident of
Australia, you are a wholesale client for the purposes of section 761G of the Australian Corporations Act
or otherwise a person to whom disclosure is not required under Part 6D.2 or Chapter 7 of the Australian
Corporations Act.

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Issuer was
incorporated as Victoria Carpet Holdings PLC on December 1, 1933, changing its name to Victoria PLC

significant assets of the Issuer are shares in its direct and indirect subsidiaries and certain intercompany
loans. For further information, see ‘‘Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure.’’

We prepare our financial statements on the basis of a 52-week or 53-week financial period. For the

**financial year,’’ the 52 weeks ended April 1, 2017 as the ‘‘2017 financial year’’ and the 53 weeks ended**
April 2, 2016 as the ‘‘2016 financial year.’’ Both the 2018 and the 2017 financial years were 52-week
periods, and the 2016 financial year was a 53-week period. Consequently, unless otherwise indicated, our
results for the 2016 financial year include an additional week of trading, which affects the comparability of
our results of operations between periods, see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results.’’_

This Offering Memorandum includes the following consolidated financial statements of the Victoria

**Statements’’).**

The 2016 Group Financial Statements, the 2017 Group Financial Statements and the 2018 Group
Financial Statements are herein collectively referred to as the ‘‘Audited Consolidated Group Financial
**Statements.’’ The Audited Consolidated Group Financial Statements, together with the Unaudited Group**
Interim Financial Statements, are herein collectively referred to as the ‘‘Consolidated Group Financial
**Statements.’’**

The Audited Consolidated Group Financial Statements have been audited by Grant Thornton UK LLP
and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (the ‘‘IASB’’) and adopted by the European Union (‘‘IFRS’’).
Our Unaudited Group Interim Financial Statements included herein and the accompanying notes thereto
as of and for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018, including the comparative financial statements for the
13 weeks ended July 1, 2017, have been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the preparation of
interim financial statements, including IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated financial information for the 52 weeks
ended June 30, 2018. This financial data is unaudited and has been calculated by adding (i) the audited
consolidated financial information for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2018 and (ii) the unaudited interim
consolidated financial information for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 and then subtracting (iii) the
unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. The unaudited

information contained in this Offering Memorandum with respect to the Victoria Group has been
prepared in accordance with IFRS.

_and IFRS.’’_

_Changes in accounting policies_

In preparing the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements, Keraben reclassified certain comparative
information for the financial year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the entry into force of Royal
Decree 602 of December 2, 2016, which modified Spanish GAAP from January 1, 2016 and primarily
impacted the entry and valuation of intangible assets. Except as otherwise indicated in this Offering
Memorandum, we present and discuss the restated financial information for the year ended December 31,
2015 in the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum rather
than the financial information as reported in the 2015 Keraben Financial Statements. For additional
information on the accounting change and restatement, see note 2-e to the 2016 Keraben Financial
Statements.

**_Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U._**

The Saloni Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Spanish GAAP and
audited by Saloni’s historical independent auditor, KPMG Auditores, S.L. The Saloni Interim Financial
Statements have been reviewed by KPMG Auditores, S.L.

This Offering Memorandum also includes Saloni’s unaudited financial data for the 12 months ended
June 30, 2018. This financial data is unaudited and has been calculated by adding (i) the consolidated
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) the unaudited consolidated interim
financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and then subtracting (iii) the unaudited
consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The unaudited financial
information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 has been prepared solely for the purpose of this
Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been
audited or reviewed. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018
presented herein is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 is not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2018 and should
not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation.

**_Pro Forma Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial_
information (the ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information’’) including our:

- unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018,
which gives effect to our acquisitions of Keraben and Saloni as if they had occurred on July 2, 2017;
and

- unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, which gives effect to
our acquisition of Saloni as if it had occurred on June 30, 2018.

We present the Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information to illustrate the_
estimated impact of the Spanish Acquisitions on our historical consolidated financial position and results
of operations, as if all such transactions had occurred on the dates indicated. The pro forma adjustments
are described in more detail in the section entitled ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma _Condensed Consolidated_
_Financial Information.’’ The Unaudited_ _Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information does_
not reflect the effect of the acquisitions of Millennium or Serra, neither of which are considered material
to the Victoria Group after giving pro forma effect to the Spanish Acquisitions.

The Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information described above is based on_
available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information is presented for information purposes only and is not
intended to represent or be indicative of the financial condition or results of operations that we would have
reported had the transactions described above actually occurred during the periods and as of the dates
presented, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information does not purport
to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period. Our actual results may
differ significantly from those reflected in the Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial_
Information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to
prepare the Unaudited _Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. The Unaudited_ _Pro_
_Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the_
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive, IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments
nor the resulting Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information have been audited
or reviewed. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma _Condensed Consolidated Financial Information’’ for the basis of_
preparation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information should be read in conjunction
with ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and the
Historical Financial Information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information, presented on an as adjusted basis,
to illustrate the effect the Offering would have had on certain of our financial results for the 52 weeks
ended June 30, 2018 or on our financial position as of June 30, 2018, as applicable.

vii


-----

The unaudited as adjusted financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to
represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have
reported had the Offering been completed as of June 30, 2018, in the case of our as adjusted debt, as
adjusted cash and cash equivalents and as adjusted net debt, and as of July 2, 2017, in the case of our as
adjusted interest expense. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should not be taken as
indicative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial position. Our historical results may
not be indicative of our future results following completion of the Offering. The unaudited as adjusted
financial information has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting standards.

The unaudited as adjusted financial information should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations’’ and the Historical Financial Information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Non-IFRS and Non-Spanish GAAP Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain financial measures and ratios, including Underlying
EBITDA, Underlying EBITDA margin, _Pro Forma Revenue,_ _Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted_ _Pro Forma_
Revenue, Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA, Adjusted_ _Pro Forma EBITDA margin, Operating Cash Flow_
before interest, tax and exceptional items, Operating Cash Flow Conversion, Underlying Operating Profit,
Free Cash Flow before exceptional items and Underlying movement in net working capital that are not
required by, or presented in accordance with IFRS or Spanish GAAP (the ‘‘Non-GAAP Measures’’).

We present these Non-GAAP Measures because they are measures our management use to assess
operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a
means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe
they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting
effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS standards, Spanish GAAP or other
generally accepted accounting principles. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measurements of our
performance or liquidity under IFRS or Spanish GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to
operating profit or profit from continuing operations or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with IFRS or Spanish GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or
financing activities. We define these Non-GAAP Measures as follows:

- Underlying EBITDA consists of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
exceptional items (as discussed in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations’’);_

- Underlying EBITDA margin consists of Underlying EBITDA divided by revenue;

- _Pro Forma Revenue consists of revenue adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Spanish Acquisitions;_

- _Pro Forma EBITDA consists of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and_
exceptional items (as described in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations’’) presented on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the Spanish Acquisitions;_

- Adjusted _Pro Forma Revenue consists of revenue adjusted to give_ _pro forma effect to the Spanish_
Acquisitions, further adjusted for the acquisitions of Serra and Sanicova;

- Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA consists of Pro Forma EBITDA as further adjusted to give effect to our
acquisition of Sanicova, certain normalization adjustments to the EBITDA contribution of Saloni and
Sanicova, our acquisition of Serra, the effect of a planned installation of a new manufacturing line at
Serra’s production facility and the business interruption due to a roof collapse under heavy snow at
our South Wales factory in March 2018;

- Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA margin consists of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA divided by Adjusted
_Pro Forma Revenue;_

- Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and exceptional items consists of Underlying EBITDA
before non-cash items and after Underlying movement in net working capital;

- Operating Cash Flow Conversion consists of Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and exceptional
items divided by Underlying EBITDA;

viii


-----

- Underlying Operating Profit consists of operating profit before the impact of exceptional items and
amortization of acquired intangibles;

- Free Cash Flow before exceptional items consists of Operating Cash Flow before interest, tax and
exceptional items after interest paid, income tax paid, maintenance capital expenditure and proceeds
from fixed asset disposals; and

- Underlying movement in net working capital consists of movements in working capital before the
impact of exceptional items.

Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA may be defined differently
from the corresponding terms under the Indenture. Underlying EBITDA, _Pro Forma EBITDA and_
Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in_
isolation. Some of the limitations of Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma
EBITDA are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA
and Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required to_
make such replacements;

- they do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, Underlying EBITDA, Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA
should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our
business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate
for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS or Spanish GAAP results, as applicable, and using
these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented
in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding
adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the
actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other information set forth in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations’’ and ‘‘Keraben Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations’’ are calculated using the rounded numerical data in the narrative_
description thereof.

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the various
markets or regions in which we operate and compete. The market data and certain economic and industry
data and forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from publicly available information
and independent industry publications. In particular, certain information has been derived from Global
Flooring Market, 8[th] Edition, January 2017 published by The Freedonia Group (the ‘‘Freedonia Report’’).

The Freedonia Report includes data obtained from its own research as well as data derived from industry
reports and publicly available information.

Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been
obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that there can be no assurance as to the accuracy and
completeness of such information. We believe that these industry publications are reliable, but we have not
independently verified any of the data from third-party sources. Forecasts and other forward-looking
information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the
other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum.

We cannot assure you that any of the assumptions underlying any statements regarding the flooring
industry are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Market data and statistics are
inherently predictive and speculative and are not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such
statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both
the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions
should be included in the relevant market. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics for different
markets is limited by many factors, including that (i) the markets are defined differently, (ii) the underlying
information was gathered by different methods and (iii) different assumptions were applied in compiling
the data. Accordingly, the market statistics included in this Offering Memorandum should be viewed with
caution and no representation or warranty is given by any person, including us or the Initial Purchasers, as
to their accuracy.

Certain statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding the flooring industry are not based on
published statistical data or information obtained from independent third-parties, but are based solely on
our experience, our estimates, and our own investigation of market conditions at the time of this Offering
Memorandum. We cannot assure you that any of these studies or estimates are accurate, and none of our
internal surveys or information have been verified by any independent sources. While we are not aware of
any misstatements regarding our estimates presented herein, our estimates involve risks, assumptions and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the
heading ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this Offering Memorandum.

expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our
actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which
we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forwardlooking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be
indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Offering Memorandum speaks only as of the date on
which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking

current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future
performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Moreover, we operate in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties,
you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We
urge you to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled ‘‘Presentation of Industry and Market
_Data,’’ ‘‘Summary,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_

**Overview**

We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United
Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. We are the
largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia
and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We are also a
leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. We manufacture and supply a range of carpet,
ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, luxury vinyl tile (‘‘LVT’’), artificial grass and flooring accessories. The
majority of our products are for residential use and are sold through our retail customer base. We
primarily target mid- to upper-market product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche
product segments. For the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018, we generated £630.6 million of Adjusted _Pro_
_Forma Revenue and £111.7 million of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (17.7% Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA_
margin). While we have grown over this period largely through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth
was 2.8%, 4.6% and 1.6% (adjusted for the restructuring of certain UK operations and the impact of a
weather-related business interruption).

We offer a diversified product portfolio of flooring products, both in terms of product category and target
price point. Although originally focused on soft-flooring offerings, we have gained scale in the large and
fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a
major competitor in both the soft- and hard flooring markets. The following charts set forth our Pro Forma
Revenue and Pro Forma EBITDA by geography and product segment for the 2018 financial year.

(4) Other includes Carpet tiles (1.0%) and Wood (0.3%).

We have a strong and long-standing presence in the UK carpet industry. To build on this competitive
advantage, we expanded into the complementary flooring underlay market by adding flooring underlay
operations in both the United Kingdom and Australia in 2015 and 2016. This was achieved through the
acquisitions of Interfloor in 2015 and Ezi Floor in 2016, flooring underlay manufacturers based in the
United Kingdom, and the 2016 acquisition of Dunlop, a flooring underlay manufacturer based in Australia.
In response to robust growth in demand for artificial grass, we further expanded into the artificial grass
market through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands in 2017. Most recently, we

1


-----

entered the ceramic flooring segment in Continental Europe through our acquisitions of Serra (Italy) and
Keraben (Spain) in 2017, and of Saloni (Spain) in 2018.

We have a highly successful multi-brand strategy with over 30 brands encompassing mid- to upper-priced
products. These include 14 carpet brands covering a broad range of wool and synthetic products, such as
Victoria, Whitestone Weavers, StainFree and Quest; Westex and Hugh Mackay, two of our premium
carpet brands; Duralay, Dunlop and Tredaire, leading and innovative flooring underlay brands; Keraben
and Saloni, mid- to upper-market ceramic flooring brands; Distinctive and Heartridge, under which we sell
high-end LVT products; and GrassInc and Avalon, under which we sell artificial grass products for a wide
range of applications, including parks, sports grounds, lawns and indoor applications.

We benefit from economies of scale through our consolidated manufacturing facilities in the United
Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our business is selectively vertically
integrated, comprising three components: (i) the design and specification of the majority of our products;
(ii) the manufacturing of the substantial majority of our products, with limited outsourcing in
circumstances in which doing so is financially and operationally beneficial; and (iii) the distribution of our
products based on their product category and customer proposition, which maximizes the turnover of our
inventory and product efficiency. We believe that this balanced approach to vertical integration creates
robust margins and increases our competitive advantage in our target markets. We believe we have
competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate, including our design capabilities, large-scale
and efficient in-house manufacturing facilities and our long-standing direct relationships with retailers
across all operating businesses.

We operate nine manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and five
manufacturing sites in Australia. Our integrated in-house capabilities allow us to operate our production
facilities flexibly, varying production levels as appropriate, while maintaining a low fixed cost base, high
efficiency and rigorous quality control. Where advantageous to do so, we have consolidated the design,
manufacturing and distribution of certain of our products.

Our core markets are the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, where we employ over
3,000 people across more than 20 sites. The largest end-market for our products is the improvement and
repair (‘‘I&R’’) end-market, and, therefore, our business is less exposed to the economic cycles that
otherwise commonly affect the smaller, cyclical construction end-market. We sell the substantial majority
of our products in the same geographical segments in which they are manufactured, placing us in close
proximity to our customer bases across core markets. Our relationships with our customers, the thousands
of flooring retailers and small number of distributors and direct sales customers we supply across the
United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are central to our success. We primarily sell directly
to retailers. In the United Kingdom alone, our 3,000-plus customers range from independent retailers to
distributors and large format chains. Some of these relationships, across operating geographies, are multigenerational and we believe the strength and depth of these relationships represent a significant
competitive advantage. When coupled with our recent expansion, these relationships allow us to offer a
broad range of products to our customers and further our cross-selling opportunities. We benefit from a
large, diverse customer base with limited concentration. For the 2018 financial year, our top ten customers
constituted approximately 15% of our _Pro Forma Revenue, with our largest customer constituting_
approximately 4% of our Pro Forma Revenue.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Market-leading business with an efficient global footprint_**

We have built a market-leading business across our core markets with a wide product range and global
production and distribution capabilities. We are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom,
with approximately 9% market share, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia, with
approximately 7% market share, and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both jurisdictions, in
each case by volume. We are also a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer in the mid- to
upper-market ceramic flooring segment by volume, with approximately 5% market share.

We manufacture a broad range of innovative products, which we distribute to leading retailers and
wholesalers across commercial and residential end-markets globally. The Group is headquartered in the
United Kingdom, with operations across the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Australia, employing over 3,000 people at more than 20 sites, including highly automated, flexible and
efficient manufacturing facilities. Our production sites across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe

2


-----

and Australia enable us to service demand in local as well as nearby markets. Through our recent
acquisitions of Keraben and Saloni in Spain, Serra in Italy, GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands and
Millennium in Belgium, we have increased our distribution of revenues across Continental Europe while
maintaining our efficient margin strategy.

We have increased efficiencies across our business by consolidating production in locations with excess
capacity while rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. At the same time, we enhanced our logistics
capabilities in the United Kingdom, which is our largest geographical segment. In 2017, we began the
reorganization of our United Kingdom manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve
productivity, manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our
Kidderminster factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the ongoing relocation of our
distribution center in the Midlands. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our United Kingdom
carpet production being shared between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We anticipate
that further efficiency gains will be made from the completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center
near London, servicing all of our brands, and the potential for a further new distribution center in northern
England.

We believe that our market-leading positions across our key end-markets, together with our wide product
range and our global distribution capabilities allow us to closely track and adapt to customer behavior
while adjusting our production levels to match demand. Specifically, as a result of our presence in multiple
product segments, our vertical integration and significant contacts across retailers, we are able to receive
substantial feedback as to end-consumer trends in design and supply volumes on a timely basis.

**_Stable flooring market dominated by the less cyclical improvement and repair end-market_**

The United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring markets are stable, mature and
attractive end-markets. Our core markets, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are
expected to undergo stable economic growth in the coming years. According to the Freedonia Report, this
economic growth is expected to translate into increased overall demand in the flooring industry across our
core markets. The combined United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring market is
forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of approximately 1.2% between 2015 and
2020, with the I&R end-market forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.8% over the same period.
The hard-flooring market is expected to experience the most substantial growth in the flooring industry.
Demand for resilient flooring (consisting primarily of vinyl, rubber and linoleum) is expected to grow at a
CAGR of approximately 3.0%, followed by non-resilient flooring (consisting primarily of ceramic, laminate
and wood) at a CAGR of approximately 3.5%. The non-resilient flooring market is expected to grow at a
particularly robust pace in Australia, a market characterized by a large building and construction sector, a
high standard of living and positive macroeconomic environment, at a CAGR of approximately 3.6%
between 2015 and 2020. We believe that our rapid and successful expansion into the hard-flooring market
in Continental Europe, as well as our sizeable presence in Australia supported by our current optimization
initiatives, collectively enable us to defend our position and take advantage of these growth trends.

In addition to the stable growth forecast for the flooring industry generally, our business benefits
specifically from our focus on the I&R end-market. The I&R end-market in the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe is approximately four to five times larger than the new construction end-market and
has limited dependence on new construction activity. Demand for new flooring in the new construction
end-market tends to lag overall growth in new construction and is typically more volatile than the I&R
end-market due to the cyclical nature of new construction activity. Conversely, the I&R end-market, which
is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to upgrade the appearance of existing homes,
is characterized by greater price inelasticity and is typically less susceptible to business cycles. Based on the
composition of our customer base, we believe that over 80% of our revenues are generated from the I&R
end-market.

**_Established market position in an industry with high barriers to entry_**

Over the course of our operating history, we have developed sufficient scale, expertise and breadth of
product offering to succeed notwithstanding the significant barriers to entry in the flooring industry. We
believe this business model would be difficult to replicate due to the following structural barriers to entry:

- **Fragmented customer base: Our broad customer base is dominated by independent retailers, with**
whom we enjoy long-standing and, we believe, mutually beneficial relationships;

3


-----

- **Strength of brands: We have a diverse portfolio of over 30 brands that we believe enjoy strong**
recognition with customers;

- **Globally priced key raw materials costs: Raw materials constitute the majority of our cost of**
production. Our primary raw materials are synthetic yarn, clay, natural gas, polyurethane foam and
trim and rubber, which have relatively consistent global pricing. As a result, we are able to keep
certain of our costs competitive with low-cost international manufacturers looking to distribute their
products within our geographical segments;

- **Difficulty in transport of products: Carpets are large, non-palletized goods and ceramic tiles are heavy,**
making both products difficult and expensive to transport. High transportation costs are another
barrier preventing low-cost international manufacturers from distributing their products within our
geographical segments. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical
segments in which they are manufactured, which minimizes our transportation costs;

- **Difficulty in contract manufacturing: Long production runs are required in our industry in order to**
enable cost-effective manufacturing. As a result, contract manufacturing is not a feasible alternative to
the owned production capabilities that we have; and

- **Capital barriers and technical expertise: New entrants seeking to establish operations locally would**
face significant up-front capital costs and a scarcity of technical and production expertise.

We believe these barriers to entry protect our business from both the threat of inexpensive, international
imports as well as new entrants to our local markets.

**_Highly diversified business across products, geographies and customers_**

We have a diverse product portfolio consisting of wool and synthetic broadloom carpets, ceramic tiles,
laminate, flooring underlay, LVT and other hardwood flooring products, artificial grass, carpet tiles and
flooring accessories. These products are spread across over 30 brands. Notably, while we have sought to
selectively expand our product portfolio, we have strategically elected not to enter into product markets
characterized by low margins and high price competition, such as linoleum. We primarily target the mid- to
upper markets and employ a commercially focused product development process to proactively manage
our margins. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes inform one another and
are designed to yield product specifications that align with our target customers’ price points while
optimizing margins.

Our customer relationships and manufacturing flexibility also aid diversification of our product portfolio.
Our close relationships with our customers provide us with valuable feedback and enable us to adapt to
changes in end-customer preferences. We are also able to avoid large-scale product warehousing because
of our ability to rapidly scale production on short notice, allowing us to maintain lean inventory levels
which further aid product diversification.

The evolution of our product range has been targeted and deliberate, underpinned by selective acquisitions
through which we have increased production flexibility and our product and geographical diversification.
As a result of this careful expansion, we are not overly dependent on any particular product segment, with
ceramic flooring products, carpet products and flooring underlay constituting 39%, 37% and 18% of our
revenue for the 2018 financial year after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisitions. Additionally, we are
not unduly dependent on any particular brand (with Keraben constituting the largest proportion of our
sales at 18.3%) or geographical segment and have the flexibility to produce and serve multiple geographies
and shift production as needed based on fluctuations in demand. After giving _pro forma effect to the_
Acquisitions, 60.6% of our revenue by origin was generated outside of the United Kingdom for the 2018
financial year.

Through our portfolio of over 30 brands, we offer a broad, differentiated and regularly evolving product
portfolio for a variety of end-markets, including residential, office and hospitality and leisure. The breadth
of these offerings provide us with a diverse customer base consisting of independent retailers, national
retailers, Do-It-Yourself (‘‘DIY’’) retailers and buying groups, with over 3,000 customers in the United
Kingdom, over 2,000 customers in Continental Europe and approximately 800 customers in Australia.
These retailers are highly diversified across specialist, non-specialist, general and DIY sales channels. The

for the Acquisitions.

Significantly, the vast majority of our products are sold directly to independent flooring retailers rather
than third-party distributors, which we believe drives brand loyalty and long-term relationships. Our
involvement in the supply chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold directly to
consumers, optimizing margins. Unlike some of our competitors, a minority of our revenue is generated
from large retail chains. Approximately 55% of our revenue comes from independent retailers (including
DIY retailers) while approximately 25% comes from large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2018 financial
year, no customer represented more than 4% of our revenue with our largest ten customers accounting for
approximately 15% of our revenue.

We believe that the breadth of our product offering and the diversity of our revenue streams support the
resilience of our business and that our sales of products across a number of attractive flooring segments
increases our cross-selling opportunities, visibility and pricing power. We further believe that our wide
product offering, expansive geographic footprint and diverse base of customers strengthen our position as
a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products while positioning us for
future growth.

**_Low operational gearing through a flexible cost base and low capital expenditure requirements_**

We benefit from low operational gearing, with 54% of our costs (46% of our cost base as a percentage of
our revenues) for the 2018 financial year (pro forma for the Acquisitions) varying directly with revenue. A
further 31% of our costs (26% of our cost base as a percentage of revenues) for the 2018 financial year
(pro forma for the Acquisitions) is semi-variable, with the ability to adapt within a few months. We have
been able to maintain this low operational gearing despite being a manufacturing business by automating
certain processes and because our equipment generally has a very long useful life. We also benefit from
multiple production sites with the flexibility, capacity and cost structure to vary production levels, enabling
our business to maintain efficiency in favorable markets and resilience through the more challenging parts
of the business cycle.

Further, as much of our plant and equipment is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a modular
basis, our business requires a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash
flows. Of our capital expenditures for the 2018 financial year, £14.1 million related to maintenance and
£15.2 million related to growth. While our maintenance capital expenditures have increased on an absolute
basis over the last three years, our maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue
remained relatively stable, at 4.0%, 3.3% and 3.3% for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years,
respectively.

**_Strong financial performance with resilience through economic downturns_**

We were resilient throughout the financial crisis, increasing revenue in each of 2006–2011. Our focus on
the less cyclical I&R end-market made us less susceptible to the worst effects of the financial crisis, during
which time consumers opted for less expensive forms of home improvement. While we shifted our sales
mix to lower than average selling prices in order to protect sales volumes, we were able to utilize our
flexible cost base to maintain our margins.

Since the financial crisis, we have expanded our product portfolio, developed a more efficient production
footprint and introduced better inventory management. We now offer an expanded product portfolio and
have shifted from a pure carpeting business to a hard and soft-flooring group, with a range of carpet,
ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, LVT and artificial grass products. As a result of our increased scale

5


-----

through acquisitions and various operational initiatives, we also possess a more efficient production
footprint and better inventory management. We believe that these changes have strengthened our
underlying business and leave us poised to capitalize on the more favorable macroeconomic backdrop,
especially as we have also diversified geographically in both manufacturing and sales without
over-exposure to any single geographic market.

Since the change in our management in 2012, we have experienced a period of accelerated growth coupled
with improvements in EBITDA margins, increasing from 7.2% in the 52 weeks ended March 29, 2014 (the
‘‘2014 financial year’’) to 15.2% in the 2018 financial year. These increases began with a restructuring in the
52 weeks ended March 30, 2013 (the ‘‘2013 financial year’’) that included a one-off stock rationalization
and mill consolidation to reduce excess capacity. Further, we have maintained consistently high Operating
Cash Flow Conversion of 99.4%, 95.4% and 99.7% in the 2018, 2017 and 2016 financial years, respectively.
This strong free cash flow generation has allowed us to de-lever following new acquisitions, and has been
supported by relatively limited working capital requirements and stable capital expenditures that have
grown in proportion to the growth in our business since 2014.

We remain committed to continuing margin growth in our existing businesses. In 2017, we began the
reorganization of our UK manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve productivity,
manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our Kidderminster
factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the ongoing relocation of our distribution center in
the Midlands. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our UK carpet production being shared
between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We anticipate that further efficiency gains will
be made from the completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center near London, servicing all of
our brands, and the potential for a further new distribution center in northern England.

In line with this focus, we announced our intention to rationalize our flooring underlay production
facilities in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, which we acquired in January 2017 and plan to concentrate
production in a single facility in the second half of 2019. We acquired these two facilities in Sydney and
Melbourne through our purchase of Dunlop Flooring in January 2017. We have decided to concentrate our
manufacturing activity at our existing Sydney site while closing the site near Melbourne. Together with an
investment of approximately AUD $2.1 million in new technology, this initiative is expected to improve raw
material processing, finishing and packaging at the Sydney site. This combination of rationalization and
investment are intended to increase our operational agility and result in a more efficient and productive
operation.

**_Proven acquisition track record and ability to realize synergies_**

Since 2013, we have participated in the consolidation of a highly fragmented industry and believe we have
built a reputation as a credible acquirer. Though we aim to maximize the realization of synergies following
an acquisition, our strategy is primarily focused on acquiring high-quality, high-margin targets that we
intend to operate as stand-alone propositions. We seek to acquire businesses that are growing and
profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive advantages in production and
distribution. Our acquisition targets generally possess sustainable above-average margins and are led by
committed and capable management teams. We believe this focus on stand-alone business value allows us
to minimize our downside acquisition risk while maintaining room for synergistic upside potential.

Since the change in Group management in 2013, we have made 13 acquisitions, including the recent
acquisitions of Keraben, Serra and Saloni. Over this period, our Underlying EBITDA has grown from
£2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to £64.7 million in the 2018 financial year, and, after giving effect to
the Acquisitions, our Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA in the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 was_
£111.7 million.

Our increased scale through acquisitions has given us significant opportunities for margin improvement.
We possess better buying power for raw materials and have consolidated our manufacturing, distribution,
warehousing and logistics capacity. Additionally, the acquisition of production capacity and development
of distribution facilities in close proximity to our clients is also a competitive advantage, as the high levels
of customer dispersion typical in the flooring industry can generate substantial distribution costs. Our
strategically located distribution facilities allow us to minimize these costs and access customers in a timely
and cost-effective manner. Through our increased scale, we have also been able to rationalize product
lines, improve working capital management through SKU reduction and take advantage of cross-selling
products through new distribution channels. As a result of the above, our acquisition strategy has resulted

6


-----

in realized margin synergies, as evidenced by the increase in our Underlying EBITDA margin from 3.3% in
the 2013 financial year to 15.2% in the 2018 financial year.

We have a long history of creativity and innovation in the flooring industry, both technical and aesthetic,
and we are well-positioned to develop, together with our customers, design concepts and create innovative
products that are tailored to consumers’ tastes and preferences. Our strategic acquisitions in the ceramic
tile and artificial grass segments position us to continue to offer products tailored to a contemporary
audience. We continue to introduce new product collections every year to meet consumer preferences and
trends.

**_Experienced management team with proven track record of sustainable value creation_**

We have a strong and experienced management team that has positioned us for continued growth and
development. Geoffrey Wilding, responsible for our rapid and successful expansion, joined the Group as
Executive Chairman in 2012 and drives overall Group strategy. The 2018 financial year was Philippe
Hamers’ first full year as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hamers has over 25 years of experience in the
flooring industry, most recently chairing Europe’s largest carpet manufacturing operation before assuming
his role with us.

We operate a ‘‘team of teams’’ structure that minimizes cost friction and red tape, while capitalizing on
local expertise and allowing organic local strategies to flourish. Our global operating strategy is generated
centrally by Group-level management, including budgeting, capital expenditure planning and crossbusiness operations. Complementing our Group-level strategy, we maintain a decentralized structure with
Managing Directors responsible for the day-to-day management of each of our core operating businesses.
Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each Managing Director develops their own
strategy and tactics (reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets.

Our management team has a strong track record of identifying value-accretive acquisition targets,
integrating the acquired companies and identifying and achieving synergies. In selectively growing our
operations, we look for mature businesses with modern, well-invested production facilities, committed
management teams, established distribution channels and competitive advantages in the relevant target
market. Once a business has been acquired, we have historically been able to deliver significant production
and purchasing synergies, which continue to drive growth in operating margins and improved like-for-like
performance, as evidenced by five consecutive years of increasing EBITDA margins.

Importantly, we are focused on retaining the management teams at our operating business level, a strategy
that has proved successful for the Group. We have retained nearly all members of management in
post-acquisition earn-out periods and, out of the 13 acquisitions made by the Group since 2013, seven are
either post earn-out or did not have an earn-out period. In addition, our divisional management teams
have extensive experience in the flooring industry and we believe that their collective industry knowledge,
technical expertise, and customer and supplier relationships will enable them to continue to grow our
business and execute our strategies.

**Strategy**

**_Continue to generate sustainable organic top-line growth in selected product segments_**

Our growth since 2013 has created a consolidated platform in carpeting, flooring underlay, flooring
accessories, ceramic flooring and LVT products. While the Group has grown over this period largely
through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth was 2.8%, 4.6% and 1.6% (adjusted for operations and
the impact of a weather-related business interruption) for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years,
respectively. We intend to continue to utilize our platform in order to defend our market position, develop
new products, and leverage our distribution channels to drive organic top-line growth.

When investing in our organic development, we target product segments in which we benefit from existing
high margins and where we can increase operational efficiencies. For example, we benefit from high
margins in our ceramic flooring segments, and have planned investments in Keraben to increase ceramic
production capacity. These investments include the development of a new production plant anticipated to
begin production in 2020, the installation of new clay atomizers in floor and wall plants designed to
increase clay reception capacity and the installation of new inkjet printing machines for wall and floor
pressing and glazing processes. Additionally, in the 2018 financial year we completed the rationalization of
our UK manufacturing footprint by closing our Kidderminster factory, with our UK carpet manufacturing
now being shared between factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We recently announced a

7


-----

similar initiative in Australia, which will result in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories
into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have also strengthened our UK logistics network,
including through the establishment of our new Southern Distribution Center and the relocation of our
Midlands distribution center. We intend to continue refining the multi-site operation of this distribution
network. In addition to optimizing our cost base, these initiatives are a competitive advantage as they allow
our customers to distribute their products more efficiently, which we believe will drive increased sales.

While our primary focus is on sales to retailers and the I&R market, we also aim to grow our contract
offering directly to end-market consumers, particularly within the hospitality and leisure and construction
end-markets. Though our Whitestone operating business currently services clients within these
end-markets, we have identified these end-markets as targets for organic expansion as our existing
presence is minimal. In light of our growing ceramic tile and LVT product offerings, we have begun
designing and creating products specifically for these product segments with our sales teams concentrating
marketing efforts in these areas.

We are also making targeted investments into new product development and associated marketing
materials, aided by our selective acquisitions in new strategic areas in which we believe there is superior
and sustainable market growth and high margins. For example, we have expanded into the attractive
Continental European ceramic flooring industry with our acquisitions of Keraben, Saloni and Serra.
Non-resilient flooring, mostly consisting of the ceramic flooring segment, remains the most popular
flooring solution across Continental Europe. Additionally, our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon give us
a foothold in the rapidly expanding global artificial grass industry. We believe there are large,
underpenetrated markets for these and other products and we intend to leverage the scale of our footprint
and our diverse distribution channels in order to capitalize on these opportunities.

**_Acquisitive growth to realize margin-driving synergies and integration_**

Since 2013, we have become a consolidator in a highly fragmented industry and have built a reputation as a
disciplined and credible acquirer. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives, the Group
has grown from having Underlying EBITDA of £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to Adjusted _Pro_
_Forma EBITDA of £111.7 million in the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018._

This growth supports our belief that the flooring market is suitable for further consolidation.
Manufacturing in our industry is characterized by many small, inefficient and privately owned
manufacturers; for example, there are over 250 manufacturers in the United Kingdom and Continental
Europe. The 20 largest flooring producers globally only represented approximately 12% of global revenues
in 2015. Further, we are generally insulated from large-scale competition within the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe as the largest global manufacturers operate in the United States.

Small manufacturers offer potential economies of scale, stable backgrounds and typically operate in the
I&R end-market, which is less sensitive to economic cycles. Most carpet manufacturers trade at or below
net asset value and, therefore, incumbent owners are often keen to exit. With many retiring owners lacking
a succession plan, we are seen as an ideal buyer among few buying players in the market. We are constantly
sourcing new opportunities for acquisitive growth and aim to make two-to-three high-quality,
complementary acquisitions per year.

The acquisition origination process begins with a long list of market participants. Our policy is to avoid
acquiring turnarounds, so we only invest in currently profitable and cash-generative businesses. After
months of contact with the target’s management, and due diligence on the target’s operating sites and
financials, we consider commercial and cultural fit, possible synergies and terms of the possible acquisition.
In addition to our focus on well-run businesses with strong management teams, we stress contingent
structuring of consideration, to motivate the target and to share downside risk. With strong, rational
adherence to our acquisition strategy, we have been able to limit our downside risk.

Our consistent growth through acquisitions has allowed us to use our scale to drive operating margins.
After an acquisition, we maintain the target’s customer-facing teams, such as design, branding, sales and
marketing. This feet-on-the-ground approach allows for product and brand differentiation while
simultaneously maintaining responsiveness to dynamic customer demand. At the same time, operational
integration drives the realization of cost-savings synergies in procurement, production, logistics and IT.
These initiatives result in better buying terms with suppliers of raw materials, better working capital
management through SKU reduction and rationalization of product lines and manufacturing assets.
Importantly, our acquisition strategy creates the potential for further future consolidation of

8


-----

manufacturing capacity. We are able to realize depot, fleet and load consolidation for a more efficient
logistical process. More efficient retail network relationships created through consolidation also yield
commercial synergies such as product bundling and cross-selling while further driving sales growth and
SKU reduction.

**_Generate free cash flow to enable de-leveraging_**

A hallmark of a successful flooring business is its generation of free cash flow and high cash conversion
rates. These are due to the longevity of flooring manufacturing plants, the relatively low capital
requirements of those plants, relatively inelastic demand, and price inelasticity. When coupled with our
synergistic acquisitions, we have consistently been able to consolidate production capability, increasing
utilization, reducing SKUs, increasing stock turnover and establishing favorable trading terms with
suppliers and customers. Together, these elements have the effect of further increasing our free cash flow.
High free cash flow, in turn, allows us to rapidly de-lever.

Although much of our historical growth has been through acquisitions, we have successfully maintained
stable net leverage. Maintaining low leverage ensures the long-term health of the Group and gives us
headroom for further acquisitions. While we expect our pro forma senior net leverage to increase to 3.0x
after giving effect to the Transactions, we intend to return to historical leverage levels in the near future.

**History**

We were established in 1895 as a carpet manufacturing business and have grown to an international scale
in subsequent years. We have been publicly listed since 1963, moving from the London Stock Exchange’s
Main Market to its AIM Market in 2013. When Geoffrey Wilding joined as Executive Chairman in 2012, a
new board was appointed to conduct a full strategic review of the Group. In 2014, Mr. Wilding acquired a
controlling stake in the Group. Since our formation, we have grown beyond our initial soft-flooring
offerings and gained scale through acquisitions in the fragmented flooring industry diversifying both by
product and geography.

Since 2013, we have made 13 acquisitions across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia
to become a global player in the flooring industry. In late 2017, we expanded our position in Continental
Europe, with the acquisition of Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Both Serra and Keraben are
Continental European hard flooring manufacturers. Also, in early 2017, in response to the robust growth
of the artificial grass market, we gained artificial grass-manufacturing capability through our acquisitions of
GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands. We have additionally acquired the business and assets of
Millennium in 2017, a carpet distribution business based in Belgium, further enhancing our presence in the
UK high-volume market. Most recently, in August 2018, we further increased our presence in the
Continental European hard flooring market with our acquisition of Saloni, a Spanish ceramic tile
manufacturer.

In 2013, Victoria Carpets Limited, one of our core historic operating subsidiaries, was awarded the
Queen’s Royal Warrant and further supplied the red carpet for the wedding of Prince William and
Catherine Middleton, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

**The Transactions**

On August 7, 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Saloni, a Spanish ceramic tile manufacturer with
significant presence in the Continental European ceramic flooring industry. In connection with our
acquisition of Saloni, we entered into the Bridge and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which provided
for term borrowings under the Bridge Facility of A445.0 million as well as aggregate multi-currency
borrowings of up to an equivalent of £60.0 million. We used drawings under the Bridge Facility, together
with the proceeds of the Equity Placement: (i) to fund the consideration payable for our acquisition of
Saloni on August 7, 2018, (ii) to repay the Saloni Legacy Indebtedness, (iii) to repay the amounts drawn
under the Legacy Revolving Credit Facility and other existing indebtedness of the Victoria Group; and
(iv) for general corporate purposes.

In connection with our entry into the Bridge and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we repaid and
cancelled the Legacy Revolving Credit Facility. On or about the Issue Date, the New Revolving Credit
Facility will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral and certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will
accede as guarantors. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Bridge and Revolving Credit Facility

**Recent Developments**

_The following information relating to our performance for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2018 is derived_
_from our internal management accounts for the months of July, August and September 2018. This information_
_has been prepared by management. It has not been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any procedures by_
_our auditors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. Because this information is preliminary, it is_
_subject to change and those changes could be material. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’_
_for a discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._

For the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2018, we have continued to grow our Group sales in a challenging
market, with like-for-like revenue growth of approximately 3% as compared with the equivalent period
during the prior year. Notwithstanding this revenue growth, our strategy of focusing on driving sales
volume in the current market has resulted in some downward pressure on our operating margins during
this period.

_UK & Europe_

In soft flooring, which excludes ceramic tiles, we have maintained our strategy of focusing our product mix
on competitive products, lowering average selling prices and driving sales volume. As a result, sales have
grown organically at a rate of approximately 5% as compared with the equivalent period during the prior
year.

In hard flooring, since our acquisition of Saloni in August 2018, we have identified a number of operational
synergies between Keraben and Saloni that we are in the process of implementing. Further, since Serra
commenced the manufacturing of new porcelain products in June, we have seen positive customer uptake.
Nevertheless, this sector has experienced an increase in pricing pressure since the start of the current
financial year, which has had a marginal impact on overall sales growth and margins.

_Australia_

The Australia segment, which represented approximately 18% of our _Pro Forma Revenue for the 2018_
financial year, has experienced marginally slower performance, with sales declining by approximately 1.5%
as compared with the equivalent period during the prior year.

through Camden Holdings Limited, our Executive Chairman, Geoffrey Wilding, was Victoria PLC’s second largest shareholder
with 17.10% of its share capital, after Invesco Limited which holds 19.25% of its share capital. Other shareholders account for
the remainder of the shares, none of which have a shareholding greater than ten percent.

(2) The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any of the Issuer’s existing
and future senior indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer that is secured by property or assets that do not also secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and
assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
liabilities (including trade payables) of subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees. Subject to the terms of the security
documents, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by (i) a first priority share charge (or, in the case of Spain, pledge)
over all of the issued share capital of the Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales (which, in the case of Victoria Midco
Holdings Limited, will include only its ordinary shares), Australia and Spain; (ii) first priority fixed and floating charge over
substantially all of the present and future assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales; and (iii) a
first priority charge over substantially all of the present and future assets of the Guarantors incorporated in Australia. Pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
will be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by
the Guarantors and secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on or about the Issue Date. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security.’’_

(3) Victoria PLC, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales is the ultimate holding company for
the Group and is the Issuer of the Notes. On the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering to repay the Bridge
Facility and, together with cash on hand, pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Offering. We used drawings under
the Bridge Facility, together with the proceeds of the Equity Placement: (i) to fund the consideration payable for our acquisition

of Saloni on August 7, 2018, (ii) to repay the Saloni Legacy Indebtedness, (iii) to repay the amounts drawn under the Legacy
Revolving Credit Facility and other existing indebtedness of the Victoria Group; and (iv) for general corporate purposes. See
‘‘—The Transactions,’’ ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

(4) On or about the Issue Date, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will become effective, providing
for aggregate multi-currency borrowings of up to £60.0 million equivalent under the New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect
that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Issue Date. On or about the Issue Date, the New Revolving
Credit Facility will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral and certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will accede as
guarantors. The guarantors of the New Revolving Credit Facility will also be the Guarantors of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be repaid
with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘—New Revolving Credit Facility.’’ As at the date of this Offering Memorandum,_
the New Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.

(5) The Notes will be guaranteed on a general, senior basis by the Guarantors, which on the Issue Date will be Victoria Midco
Holdings Limited, Victoria Carpets Limited, Westex (Carpets) Limited, Abingdon Flooring Limited, Interfloor Limited, View
Logistics Limited, The Victoria Carpet Company Proprietary Limited, Quest Flooring Pty Ltd, Primary Flooring Pty Ltd,
Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. and Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. Each Guarantee will be a senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor and
will rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, and will
rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment. Each
Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of such Guarantor that is secured by
property or assets that does not also secure the Guarantees, to the extent of the value of such property or assets so securing
such indebtedness. The Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances. The Guarantors represented 86.5% of our
Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018, 89.5% of our Pro Forma Revenue for the 52 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 and 87.9% of our pro forma total assets (excluding acquired intangibles and goodwill arising on consolidation) as
of June 30, 2018 after giving effect to the Spanish Acquisitions. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the
liability of the Guarantors will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security
_and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

The Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.
For more information on the security interests granted, see
‘‘Description of the Notes—Security’’ and for more information
on potential limitations to the security interests, see ‘‘Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees_
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure.’’_

The security interests over the Collateral may be released under
certain circumstances. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and Our Structure—There are circumstances other than_
_repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_
_securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released_
_automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee,’’_
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security—Release of_
_Security.’’_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or
any surviving entity) under or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee will be made free and clear of, and without
withholding or deduction for taxes, unless required by law. If any
withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes imposed
by any relevant taxing jurisdiction is required, the Issuer, the
Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, will pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net
amount received by each holder of the Notes after such
withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount the
holder would have received if such taxes had not been required
to be withheld or deducted, subject to certain exceptions. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’

**Optional Redemption of Notes . . . . .** Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or a
portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus the applicable
‘‘make-whole’’ premium set forth in this Offering Memorandum,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem on one
or more occasions up to 40% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) using the
net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price
equal to % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date
of redemption; _provided that at least 50% of the original_
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption.

Prior to, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to
10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) during each 12-month period
commencing on the Issue Date at its option, from time to time,
at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of
the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any.

On or after, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all
or a portion of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in

interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

**Redemption for Taxation . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may redeem the Notes, as applicable, in whole, but not in
part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Redemption upon Changes in Withholding Taxes.’’_

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event,
U.S. investors generally will be required to include OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a
constant yield accrual method, regardless of their regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a
result, U.S. investors will generally include any OID in income in
advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. For
more information, see _‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain_
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a ‘‘change of
control,’’ the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash of 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase.

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control.’’

**Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders
of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of
the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or
incentive fee). See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption—General.’’_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will contain covenants that, among other things,

‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.’’_

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.’’_

manufacturing and logistics operations, as well as other corporate restructuring.

costs on the sale of the business to the Victoria Group, including advisory fees, the previous management incentive plan

**Adjusted** **_Pro Forma Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._** **630.6**

(a) This adjustment gives pro forma effect to our acquisition of Sanicova, a sister company of Saloni acquired together with
Saloni on August 7, 2018 but not reflected in our Pro Forma Revenue, as if such acquisition had occurred on July 2, 2017.
We have estimated the revenue contribution of Sanicova for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 on the basis of the audited
annual financial information of Sanicova for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(b) This adjustment gives _pro forma effect to our acquisition of Serra as if it had occurred on July 2, 2017. The revenue_
contribution of Serra for the period from July 2, 2017 to December 1, 2017, the date on which the acquisition was
completed, has been extracted from Serra’s monthly management accounts over this period.

(3) In this Offering Memorandum, we present Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 as an additional
measure of our operating performance. The presentation of Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA is based upon a number of_
significant assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and have summarized below. We encourage you to
evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis. There can be no
assurance, however, that our estimates and assumptions are or will prove accurate in all material respects. These amounts have
not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm. Adjusted Pro Forma
EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only and is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an
accurate or complete picture of our results of operations for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 had each of the items for which
an adjustment is made occurred as of the dates indicated and may not be comparable to the consolidated financial information
of the Victoria Group, Keraben or Saloni included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our actual results may differ
significantly from those reflected in our Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA.

**Adjusted** **_Pro Forma EBITDA_** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **111.7**

(a) This adjustment gives pro forma effect to (i) our acquisition of Sanicova, a sister company of Saloni acquired together with
Saloni but not reflected in our Pro Forma EBITDA, as if such acquisition had occurred on July 2, 2017 and (ii) certain
normalization adjustments to the EBITDA contributions of Saloni and Sanicova for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018.
We estimate that the EBITDA contribution of Sanicova for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 would have been
A0.7 million. The normalization adjustments include (i) the impact of certain non-recurring items, (ii) the elimination of
certain non-applicable expenses that existed prior to the acquisition under the previous ownership structure and (iii) the

alignment of Saloni’s financial information to our accounting policies. Management estimates, based on a quality of
earnings assessment prepared by an international accounting firm, that Saloni’s normalized EBITDA for the 52 weeks
ended June 30, 2018 would have been A17.1 million. This adjustment does not include any cost or revenue synergies
expected following the acquisition of Saloni.

(b) This adjustment gives _pro forma effect to our acquisition of Serra as if it had occurred on July 2, 2017. The EBITDA_
contribution of Serra for the period from July 2, 2017 to December 1, 2017, the date on which the acquisition was
completed, has been extracted from Serra’s monthly management accounts during this period.

(c) This adjustment reflects management’s estimate of the incremental EBITDA that would have been generated during the
twelve months ended June 30, 2018 had production not been disrupted due to the planned removal of an existing red body
tile production line and the installation of a new porcelain production line. This adjustment does not give effect to any
assumed uplift in volume or profitability from the sale of porcelain products being manufactured by the new production
line.

(d) This adjustment reflects management’s estimate of the incremental EBITDA that would have been generated during the
twelve months ended June 30, 2018 had production at our South Wales factory not been temporarily disrupted due to the
collapse of its roof under heavy snow in March 2018.

(4) Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA margin represents Adjusted_ _Pro Forma EBITDA as a percentage of Adjusted_ _Pro Forma_
Revenue.

(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents reflect our cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2018 as adjusted to give effect to
(i) an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of £20.1 million as a result of our acquisition of Saloni and the related financing
and (ii) the portion of estimated underwriting fees and commissions, other transaction costs and professional fees and expenses
to be paid in connection with the Offering that are expected to be paid with cash on hand.

(2) As adjusted senior debt includes debt outstanding under the Notes. We expect that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be
undrawn as of the Issue Date. As adjusted senior debt does not include amounts drawn under the BGF loan as it is unsecured
and does not benefit from credit support from our operating subsidiaries. As adjusted senior debt is presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to represent what our senior debt would have been had the Transactions occurred on
June 30, 2018, nor does it purport to project our senior debt for any future period or our financial position at any future date.
We have translated certain euro amounts into pounds sterling at the rate of A1.1284 = £1.00, which was the period-end
exchange rate used in our Unaudited Group Interim Financial Statements as of June 30, 2018.

(3) As adjusted net senior debt represents as adjusted senior debt net of as adjusted cash and cash equivalents. As adjusted net
senior debt is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our net senior debt would have
been had the Transactions occurred on June 30, 2018, nor does it purport to project our net senior debt for any future period or
our financial position at any future date. We have translated certain euro amounts into pounds sterling at the rate of A1.1284 =
£1.00, which was the period-end exchange rate used in our Unaudited Group Interim Financial Statements as of June 30, 2018.

(4) As adjusted interest expense represents the interest expense on our as adjusted net senior debt. As adjusted interest expense
excludes amortized debt issuance cost incurred in connection with the Offering and excludes original issue discount, if any. As
adjusted interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense
would have been had the Transactions occurred on July 2, 2017, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any
future period or our financial position at any future date.

**Historical financial information of Keraben**

The following tables set forth the summary financial information as of the dates and for the periods
indicated below for Keraben, which we acquired on November 16, 2017. The summary financial
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 have been derived from the
Keraben Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In preparing the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements, Keraben reclassified certain comparative
information for the financial year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the entry into force of Royal
Decree 602 of December 2, 2016, which modified Spanish GAAP from January 1, 2016, and primarily
impacted the entry and valuation of intangible assets. Except as otherwise indicated in this Offering
Memorandum, we present and discuss the restated financial information for the year ended December 31,
2015 in the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum rather
than the financial information as reported in the 2015 Keraben Financial Statements. For additional
information on the accounting change and restatement, see note 2-e to the 2016 Keraben Financial
Statements.

The Keraben Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Spanish GAAP. The
Consolidated Group Financial Statements of Victoria Group included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Spanish GAAP differ from IFRS in certain
material respects, a summary of which is set forth in ‘‘Annex A: Summary of Certain Differences between
_Spanish GAAP and IFRS.’’_

You should also read the following information in conjunction with the ‘‘Presentation of Financial
_Information,’’ ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Keraben Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before investing in the Notes, you should consider carefully the_
_following risk factors and all information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects. If any of these events occur, our business,_
_financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected, the_
_Issuer may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your_
_investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See_
_‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’ Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these_
_forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in_
_this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business**

**_The success of our business is contingent on understanding consumer preferences and identifying trends._**

Flooring products are subject to changing consumer tastes and trends and must appeal to a broad range of
consumers whose preferences cannot always be predicted. The extent of our success depends in large part
on our ability to follow, gauge and react to trends in home decoration and changing consumer preferences
in a timely manner. In particular, as we continue to expand into new markets, we must continue to meet
the demands of new consumers who may have different tastes and follow different trends. For example, we
noted a significant increase in demand in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe for artificial grass
and consequently acquired artificial grass manufacturers in Continental Europe to incorporate this into
our product offering. If we are unable to identify or respond effectively to consumer preferences and
demand, we may experience back orders, order cancellations or overstock, any of which would have a
negative effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to launch competitive
products in a timely or successful manner in response to shifts in consumer demand. Our failure to further
develop and introduce new products attractive to the market could cause our reputation to suffer and our
products to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our sales
to decline. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. See ‘‘—Consumers may choose alternative flooring solutions over our products.’’

**_The flooring industry is highly competitive._**

The Group operates in mature and highly competitive markets in which we face significant competition
from local flooring manufacturers in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, and, to a
lesser degree, from international manufacturers with respect to certain palletized products like LVT.
Certain of our competitors may have greater resources and access to capital than we do, which may afford
them a competitive advantage in the innovation, production and distribution of new or existing products.
The arrival of new competitors, new products or new technologies developed by competitors could also
affect our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our margins
with respect to our competitors, particularly if new entrants gain access to one or more of our markets, or
if competition intensifies for any other reason. Maintaining our competitive position could also require
additional investments in new products and new manufacturing facilities, or further development of our
distribution network, marketing and sales activities. These competitive pressures could lead to reduced
demand for our products or force us to lower our prices, which would negatively impact our margins. Such
events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The designs of our products are not commercially protected and can be reproduced by our competitors._**

The duplication of designs and innovations is a routine feature of the industry in which we operate, which
functions on the continued renewal of products in accordance with constantly evolving consumer and
market trends. We therefore do not substantially rely on intellectual property and have no material
proprietary rights relating thereto, aside from registered trademarks over our brand names. In keeping
with industry practice, as our designs are, in general, not registered, our products have historically been
and may continue to be reproduced by our competitors. As we have little recourse to prevent the
reproduction of our products, if our competitors expand the reproduction of products that we have
designed, and/or sell reproductions of our products to our customers at lower prices, our market share

33


-----

and/or operating profit may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Consumers may choose alternative flooring solutions over our products._**

We derive most of our revenues from the manufacture of soft-flooring offerings, such as carpeting and
carpet tiles, and ceramic flooring products. Consumer preferences may shift and they may begin to prefer
other flooring solutions due to changes in market trends, technological advancements in flooring products,
or personal preference and we may lack sufficient scale and geographical footprint with respect to our
flooring offerings in order to benefit from this shift. There can be no assurance that the products we offer
will remain competitive within the general flooring market, or that consumers will continue to purchase
flooring products in line with previous purchasing habits. We have invested significantly in our carpet and
ceramic tile offerings and manufacturing capacity and, to the extent consumers in any one market or over
multiple markets choose alternative flooring solutions, or if carpet and ceramic flooring products were to
fall out of favor in one or multiple markets, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our strategy to acquire new businesses and enter into new markets may fail or advance at a slower pace than_**
**_planned, limiting the potential growth of our revenue._**

We intend to increase revenue and profitability by expanding into new product and geographical markets.

As part of our growth strategy, we evaluate opportunities for acquiring complementary businesses that may
supplement, but not replace, our internal organic growth. Since 2016, we have acquired Ezi Floor, Dunlop
Flooring, Avalon, GrassInc, Millennium, Keraben, Serra and Saloni. However, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to identify and purchase suitable complementary businesses or assets in the future. Any
acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of
debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense. We may experience difficulties in
integrating future acquired entities into our business, incur higher than expected costs and not realize all
the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, such as in logistics and manufacturing, if any.
Such transactions may also disrupt our relationships with current and new employees, customers and
suppliers.

In addition, the success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company
and retain key management personnel, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a
disproportionate amount of our management’s attention and our financial and other resources. The failure
to successfully integrate these acquired businesses could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. Moreover, our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have
greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than
we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring the businesses that we target to the benefit of our
competitors. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future
acquisition, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall
operations. Our acquisition strategy could further impact our financial statements, resulting in the
recognition of goodwill and intangible assets upon consolidation of these entities, as further described in
our Audited Consolidated Group Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in completing business acquisitions or successfully integrating previously acquired companies.

The future success of acquisitions may be affected if we fail to adequately assess the commercial aspects of
an acquisition target, such as in our revenue projections, list of competitors or margin analyses. We may
also fail to correctly estimate customer demand in a local market or may be unable to successfully establish
our products in a new location. This risk is elevated in new international markets where our lack of
experience may make it more difficult to assess customer preferences and local tastes. Although we
conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will
discover all operational deficiencies or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be
responsible as a successor owner or operator, and actual developments may differ significantly from our
expectations. Further, our market research analysis may prove to be inadequate, particularly due to factors
that are difficult to assess due to insufficient data, such as in periods when market conditions are changing.
As a result, our investments in new locations may not yield the anticipated returns that could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

-----

**_Our industry is affected by economic conditions, particularly to the extent such conditions impact consumer_**
**_confidence and the residential and commercial renovation markets._**

The flooring industry depends heavily on consumer confidence and the residential and commercial
redecoration and renovation markets, which can be affected by the cyclical nature of the general economy.
Though we are not significantly exposed to the new construction end-market, the construction end-market
is traditionally a large driver of demand in the flooring industry and is also affected by the cyclical nature of
the economy. Our business tends to be influenced, in particular, by changes in consumer confidence, in
disposable income, interest rates and the availability of credit. These factors can cause fluctuations in
demand, and, as a result, in our sales volumes and margins. For example, the global economic downturn in
2008 and 2009 had a negative impact on the flooring industry and on our business.

Economic activity remains dependent on highly accommodative macroeconomic policies and is subject to
downside risks. The implementation of policies that are or are perceived to be less consumer-friendly may
restrict economic recovery, and as such, there can be no assurance of a favorable change in consumer
confidence. Such trends are also influenced by overall economic growth and a large number of other
economic and socio-political variables, including interest rates, governmental economic policies, public
spending and allocations for infrastructure, or a combination of the above factors. Further economic
downturns could impact consumer confidence, and therefore discretionary spending habits, and could
cause the industry to deteriorate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See ‘‘—We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in
_currency exchange rates.’’_

**_Our business is exposed to fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials._**

Raw material expenses represented 46% of our Adjusted _Pro Forma Revenue for the 52 weeks ended_
March 31, 2018. Certain essential raw materials that we use, such as wool, synthetic yarn, polyurethane
foam, clay and natural gas, may be subject to fluctuations in price and demand, and prices may increase to
the point where these raw materials affect our profitability. Fluctuations and price volatility, more broadly,
may be due to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including the availability of supply
(including supplier capacity constraints); general economic conditions; currency fluctuations; competitive
demand by other industries for the same raw materials; and the availability of complementary and
substitute materials. There can be no assurance that the essential raw materials that we require to
manufacture our products will continue to be available at commercially reasonable prices in the future.

In the event of a future increase in raw material prices, we may be unable to pass the resulting additional
costs on to our customers in a timely manner, or at all, as we do not have a contractual right to pass such
cost increases on to our customers. A failure to otherwise mitigate increased costs could result in lower
margins, customer loss or revenue reductions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A failure of, or a malicious attack in relation to, our IT systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our business is dependent on the normal operation of our IT systems and networks and its performance
could be materially adversely affected by a failure of our IT systems and networks to operate normally in
the event of any major failures or bugs in or breakdowns of any of the IT systems or networks (including
hardware and software) which result in significant or repeated disruption or loss or interruption in or to
their use. In addition to these risks, with the growing incidence of hacking and other forms of cyberattacks, our IT systems and networks have been, and may in the future be, subject to malicious attacks,
including cyber-attacks or the deliberate, accidental or negligent insertion of software viruses or other
malicious code, any of which may disrupt or interrupt their normal operation, prevent access to data, cause
data loss or corruption, damage or destroy some or all of our systems, cause an unexpected plant or
process shutdown or may lead to safety and reliability risks in our computerized industrial control systems.
Attempts may be made to gain unauthorized access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems and networks
in order, for example, to manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information, and even
incidents that do not amount to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences
including breaches of Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation, and could
harm our reputation.

35


-----

**_A failure to comply with data protection regulation could adversely affect our reputation and result in adverse_**
**_regulatory and financial consequences including fines and penalties._**

The EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the ‘‘GDPR’’) and the
U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 significantly change the UK/EU/EEA data protection landscape. These
regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing
of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with
substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their
rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their
behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being
brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify
regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition
of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes
with associated response plans. If a significant or widely publicized unlawful disclosure of employee or
customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a cyber-attack, the failure of our IT security systems,
employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines
or other enforcement action which could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences and could
harm our reputation.

**_We may be subject to losses that might be completely or partially uninsured._**

We maintain insurance policies with respect to certain operating risks, including product liability, damage
to property (including buildings, plants, machinery and stock, including as a result of catastrophic events
such as fire, flood, storms and earthquakes), industrial accidents and directors’ and officers’ liability. There
can be no assurance that the level of insurance we maintain is appropriate for the risks to our business or
adequate to cover all potential claims. Certain types of losses may not be covered by our insurance policies
and may be either completely or partially uninsurable or not insurable on commercially reasonable terms.
A completely or partially uninsured loss suffered by us could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain future
insurance coverage at current levels or at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on the coverage
that we maintain or obtain in the future.

**_Our operations require the use of several different currencies, exposing us to both transaction and translation effects_**
**_of exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely affect our profitability, costs and ability to repay indebtedness or_**
**_comply with certain maintenance covenants._**

We currently conduct our business operations across multiple jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our businesses are subject to risks normally
associated with international operations, including currency fluctuation risks and local business risks.

Approximately 15% of our total costs are denominated in a currency other than the local operating
currency. In particular, certain of our raw materials are purchased in foreign currencies, particularly in the
case of our United Kingdom and Australian businesses, which have raw material expenses denominated in
euro and U.S. dollars. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are exposed to risks
related to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the relative
competitive position of our manufacturing facilities, as well as our ability to market our products
successfully in other markets.

Our sales are principally invoiced in currencies other than the pound sterling and are then translated into
pounds sterling at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements. Therefore,
fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to the euro and Australian dollar in any given period
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our
customers may demand that we reduce our prices where any changes in currency exchange rates may have
been beneficial to our operations. We are exposed to currency fluctuations when we convert currencies
that we receive from the sales of our products into our reporting currency to pay salaries and other costs.

Movements in exchange rates between our reporting currency (the pound sterling) and foreign currencies
can also affect our ability to comply with financial covenants pertaining to our outstanding debt. We have
raised, and will in the future continue to raise, financing in currencies (principally the euro and Australian
dollar) other than our functional currency. As at June 30, 2018, after giving _pro forma effect to the_
Transactions, 3.1% of our consolidated indebtedness was denominated in pounds sterling, 96.8% was
denominated in euro and 0.1% was denominated in Australian dollars. In addition, a significant proportion

36


-----

of our capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling. As a result, to the
extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the currency in which indebtedness is denominated
or in which capital expenditure is to be incurred and we do not have sufficient cash flows in the respective
currency to service such debt or capital expenditure, the effective cost of servicing such indebtedness or
making such capital expenditure may be higher.

In addition, exchange rate movements may also affect our available headroom in respect of certain
financial covenants pertaining to our outstanding debt. We evaluate exchange rate risks from time to time
and hedge our risks by entering into financing agreements in the currency to which we are exposed, and by
using financial exchange rate derivative instruments. Our foreign currency hedging strategies may not
adequately protect our results of operations or balance sheet position from the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations, which may result in losses or may limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from
favorable movements in exchange rates. Any significant adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a result, strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro or Australian dollar will result in a
decrease in our net sales as reported in pound sterling, which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk—_
_Foreign Exchange Risk.’’_

**_Our currency hedging exposes us to risks._**

Although it is impossible to hedge against all currency risks, we use derivative financial instruments in
order to reduce the substantial effects of currency fluctuations on our cash flows and financial condition.
We have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, forward exchange contracts to hedge our
residual exposure to the pound sterling.

As with all hedging instruments, there are risks associated with the use of such instruments. While limiting
to some degree our risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing such hedging instruments,
we potentially forgo benefits that might result from other fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are
also exposed to the risk that our counterparties to hedging contracts will default on their obligations. We
manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by limiting the counterparties to major international banks
and financial institutions meeting established credit guidelines. However, any default by such
counterparties might have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_Disruptions to the production or delivery of our products could impact our ability to attract new customers and_**
**_retain existing customers._**

Our ability to produce and deliver our products on time is a significant element in attracting new
customers and retaining existing customers. On-time delivery is particularly important to our large retail
and wholesale customers. Though we do own certain of our transportation infrastructure, a small number
of our operating businesses deliver products through third-party services. We therefore have some
dependency on the timely performance of these third-party service providers. Our ability to deliver
products on time may be adversely affected by events or circumstances beyond our control, including, but
not limited to, unforeseen events causing the shutdown of one or more of our production facilities,
unforeseen increases in order volumes as a result of changes to the competitive landscape or otherwise, the
failure of third-party freight carriers to meet scheduled delivery times, any prolonged shortage of freight
capacity or other extended disruption of transport services, disruptions to transportation infrastructure,
including roads or rail networks, or the failure of our IT platform. If we are unable to produce and deliver
our products in accordance with the timetable specified by our customers and maintain our on-time service
delivery record, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers, which in turn
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified personnel or key employees._**

Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior
management team—a concentrated group of highly experienced individuals, including Managing Directors
of our principal brands and operating companies.

Though our high-level operating strategy is generated at the Group level (including budget, capital
expenditure planning and cross-business operations), we maintain a decentralized structure with Managing

37


-----

Directors individually responsible for the day-to-day management of the individual operating businesses.
Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each manager develops their own plan and tactics
(reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets. Thus, the loss of any member of our senior management
team, including our Managing Directors, could harm our ability to operate effectively. To the extent that
the services of members of our senior management team may be unavailable for any reason, we would be
required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our Group. There can be no assurance that we
would be able to locate or employ such senior personnel with the requisite level of experience on
acceptable terms or on a timely basis.

Our future success also depends upon our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified
employees, including those with long-standing relationships with our suppliers and customers and those
with relevant technical expertise. We compete with other companies to recruit and hire from a limited pool
of potential employees with the required skill set and/or industry experience due to, among other things, a
shortage of potential employees with the requisite skills and experience in the industry. In addition, the
training of new employees requires a large amount of our time and resources.

If one or more of our key personnel resigns to join a competitor, the loss of such personnel and any
resulting loss of existing or potential customers to any such competitor could harm our business. Our
failure to maintain competitive compensation packages, including equity incentives, may also be disruptive
to our business. In addition, we may be unable to prevent the disclosure or use of our technical knowledge,
practices or procedures by departed personnel. If we cannot attract, train and retain qualified personnel or
retain our senior management, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Significant damage to any of our facilities could cause a production disruption._**

We have manufacturing facilities across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia. Our
facilities generally specialize in a particular product segment, making it difficult to replace production in
one facility with production from another. If a disruption occurs at one or more of these production
facilities, we could experience temporary shortfalls in production, an increase in our production costs, or
quality issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The production at our plants could be adversely affected by extraordinary events, including fire, explosion,
release of high-temperature steam or water, structural collapse, machinery failure, chemical spill,
mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, road construction or closures of primary
access routes, earthquake, flood, windstorm or other severe weather conditions. Although we carry
insurance covering losses at these facilities and insurance to cover interruptions in our business, that
insurance is subject to limitations such as deductibles and maximum liability amounts and therefore may
not cover all of our losses or recover the business lost to our competitors. We may incur losses that are
outside of the coverage of our insurance policies. In the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance
coverage at current levels or at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on the coverage that we
maintain. As a result, we could experience significant losses if any of our manufacturing facilities were
damaged or ceased operation for any other reason, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to
completely or partially use our other production facilities to compensate for or mitigate the effects of any
such shutdowns. Any disruptions at our production facilities could compromise our production capacity
and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For example, our South Wales factory experienced a roof collapse in January 2018, which damaged one of
two finishing lines for several weeks. The shutdown of this finishing line impacted operations, margins and
sales. Although we received compensation for these losses through our insurance provider, we may in the
future incur losses that are outside the coverage of our insurance policies.

**_We may be affected by manufacturing defects or liability claims or may otherwise be subject to adverse publicity._**

The success of our business depends on the quality and reliability of our products and our customer
relations. In the event that our products repeatedly fail to satisfy our customers’ requirements, our
reputation and sales volumes could suffer. We may be required to manufacture at our own expense
replacement products if they fail to meet our customers’ standards, expectations and/or the applicable
health and safety standards of the country in which a product is distributed, and we may be subject to
product liability claims in connection with the foregoing. We may incur significant expenditures as a result
of product recalls or product liability claims. We may also suffer other commercial and financial
consequences in connection with manufacturing defects or product liability claims, including fines and

38


-----

payments to customers in respect of destroyed inventory, out-of-stock penalties and consumer complaints.
Furthermore, if our products fail to meet our customers’ specifications, the customer relationship may be
terminated.

Any manufacturing defects or product liability claim against us could also subject us to adverse publicity. In
addition, we may be subject to adverse publicity relating to other matters, including, but not limited to,
product quality, brand image, complaints, production facilities and employee relationships. Adverse
publicity may negatively impact our reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. The
negative impact of adverse publicity relating to any of our products, brands or production facilities may
extend far beyond the product, brand or facility involved to affect some or all of our other products, brands
and facilities. Any such adverse publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are required to comply with environmental and other regulations and obtain government permits and approvals._**

We are required to obtain and comply with numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from the
respective government authorities of each jurisdiction in which we operate, particularly in relation to
health, safety (including the security of our facilities) and environmental regulations. The process of
obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex. In addition, such permits or
approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to
obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with applicable
environmental laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and
sales and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

The environmental, health, hygiene and safety regulations with which we must comply relate primarily to
industrial safety, carbon and other emissions, and discharge of chemicals or dangerous substances
(including industrial waste and chemicals used in our production processes, such as dyes); their use,
production, traceability, handling, transport, storage and elimination or exposure to such substances; and
the remediation of industrial sites and environmental clean-up. Such regulations more heavily affect our
ceramic tile manufacturing business than our carpet manufacturing business.

Legislation in these areas typically has become broader and stricter over time, and enforcement has tended
to increase (resulting also in contractual obligations and responsibilities in these areas being imposed on
the Group). In addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed
interpretations of existing laws may elicit claims that historical routine modification activities at our
facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. Complying with these regulations may require us to incur
significant expense, especially in relation to spillages of dyes and other chemicals. We cannot predict the
amount of any increase in capital expenditure or operating expenses that we may incur to comply with
applicable environmental or other regulatory requirements, or whether we will be able to pass on these
costs to our customers through price increases. Additionally, the tightening of regulations applicable to
certain substances that we use could force us to use more expensive substances, change our formulations,
decreasing the profitability of our products.

It is difficult to anticipate changes to the foregoing laws and regulations or to their interpretation, which
could lead to significant expense or investment. If we are unable to obtain or comply with required permits
and approvals for our operations, or in the event of the possible imposition of fines or undertaking of
capital investments in the aforementioned cases, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The result of the UK referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on economic_**
**_conditions, financial markets and demand for our products and services, which could materially adversely affect_**
**_our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We are based in and have significant operations within the United Kingdom. Following a national
referendum in June 2016, on 29 March 2017, the Government formally initiated the withdrawal process for
the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’). The terms of withdrawal are
subject to ongoing negotiations which are expected to last until March 2019. The outcome of the
referendum and the terms of withdrawal have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship
between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for certain regions
within the United Kingdom to preserve their place in the European Union by separating from the United
Kingdom. Until the terms of Brexit become clear, it is not possible to determine the impact Brexit may

39


-----

have on our business. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the United Kingdom could lose access to the
single European Union market and customs union (and the Government has stated its expectation that the
United Kingdom will lose such access) resulting in an impact on the general and economic conditions in
the United Kingdom, which could directly impact the financial condition of our customers which could
have a negative impact on our revenues. A significant weakening of economic conditions in the United
Kingdom could also affect internal demand for our products as a byproduct of potentially slowed activity in
the residential and commercial renovation markets. See ‘‘—Our industry is affected by economic conditions,
_particularly to the extent such conditions impact consumer confidence and the residential and commercial_
_renovation markets._

**_Increased costs of labor, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could have a negative impact on_**
**_our operations._**

During the 2018 financial year, we had an average headcount of 2,500 employees, predominantly in the
United Kingdom and Continental Europe (84.4%) and Australia (15.6%). Our ability to meet our labor
needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and
availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, wage
rates, union membership levels and activity among our employees and changes in employment and labor or
other workplace regulation. Our labor costs could also increase due to, among other things, any potential
re-characterization of independent contractors as employees or other challenge to employment or
compensation arrangements with our personnel. If we were unable to pass on such higher costs to our
customers or otherwise mitigate such increases, these higher labor costs could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As our business is labor intensive, maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other
employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, any deterioration of the relationships
with our employees, increased costs of labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes,
work stoppages or union organizing activity, could delay or impede production and have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and operations. As a portion of our manufacturing employees are
represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs
attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also
subject to the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become
the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation.
Prolonged negotiations, conflicts or related activities could also lead to costly work stoppages and loss of
productivity. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We do not have formal purchase arrangements with a substantial majority of our customers._**

We do not have formal purchase arrangements with a substantial majority of our customers, including
many of our long-standing customers. We typically deal with our customers on a non-exclusive basis and
with no minimum purchase obligations or fixed terms. In addition, as a result of the competitive markets in
which we operate and the continued consolidation of our customer base, our customers may be able to
demand purchase arrangements that are less favorable to us or could simply elect to discontinue their
purchases, which could materially adversely impact our business. To the extent any of our competitors offer
more attractive purchasing terms to one or more of our customers, or if we attempt to materially increase
margins, we may lose customers. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in international tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results._**

As a multinational group, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required to determine worldwide tax liabilities, including, among other reasons, because tax laws and
regulations in effect in the various countries in which we operate do not always provide clear and definitive
guidelines. Our effective tax rates and tax exposure could be affected by changes in the composition of our
earnings in countries or jurisdictions with higher or lower tax rates, changes to transfer pricing rules,
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, our ability to utilize tax losses and tax
credits, changes to interest deductibility or other changes in the tax laws and the way such tax laws are
applied by tax administrations (possibly with retroactive effect), including through tax arrangements issued
by the relevant competent tax authorities.

40


-----

Non-recoverable VAT rates could increase in the future in other countries in which we operate. If we do
not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT, our profitability margins will be
negatively impacted. If we pass the increase in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of our
products, the demand for our products may decline, materially and adversely affecting our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we have VAT risks arising out of the operating
activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior
acquisitions and reorganizations.

Certain markets in which we operate have transfer pricing mechanisms that require transactions involving
associated companies to be at arm’s length. Arrangements between members of our group, such as intragroup transactions involving management services, royalties, information technology service fees,
cash-pooling arrangements, intra-group loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried out on an arm’slength basis. However, if the tax authorities in any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as
being made on an arm’s-length basis and successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax
payable by the relevant member or members of the group, in respect of both current and previous years,
may increase materially and penalties or interest may be payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer
pricing documentation evidencing the outcome of applied pricing principles, should they be requested by
the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties.

In addition, we are subject to regular audits of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the various
countries in which we operate. From time to time various governments together with the European Union
and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development make substantive changes to tax rules
and the application of rules to companies, including changes potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes
on international earnings. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes in tax
audits and amendments to tax laws and regulations in order to determine the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any
final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income
tax provisions and accruals. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in how tax authorities view our structure could have an adverse impact on our operating results._**

Our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations
and treaties. Although to date, tax authorities have not questioned our interpretation of the application of
current laws, regulations and treaties, these authorities could challenge our interpretation in the future,
resulting in an additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our
effective tax rate. In addition, tax laws, regulations or treaties enacted in the future may cause us to revalue
our deferred tax assets and result in a material increase to our effective tax rate. A change in relevant
income tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could
result in an audit adjustment or revaluation of our deferred tax assets that may cause our effective tax rate
and tax liability to be higher than what is currently presented in the consolidated financial statements,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Our reliance on third parties may subject us to risk and may disrupt or have an adverse impact on our operations._**

We rely upon third parties for various services, including for the transportation of our products and for the
provision of certain of our raw materials. Although we specify performance standards with our suppliers
and providers, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable
to their performance failures. In addition, our failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance
of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us
vulnerable to changes in our vendors’ businesses, financial condition and other matters outside of our
control, including their violations of laws or regulations, which could increase our exposure to liability or
otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our providers to
perform as expected or as contractually required could have a negative effect on our reputation with our
customers and could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we
provide to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Our business could be affected by various legal and regulatory compliance risks, including those involving antitrust,_**
**_anti-money laundering, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws and regulations._**

We are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements and risks in the countries in which we have
facilities or sell our products, involving compliance with antitrust, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery,
anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery
Act. In recent years, there has been a general increase in both the frequency and severity of enforcement
under such laws. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. We
may be unaware of developments in such laws and regulations and any of our employees, contractors,
agents and licensees or third party suppliers and providers involved in our sales may take actions in
violation of such policies, any of which may subject to legal or regulatory action by foreign or domestic
governments or regulators.

Our existing compliance controls may not be sufficient in order to prevent or detect inadequate practices,
fraud and violations of law by our intermediaries, consultants, sales agents and employees. In the case that
any intermediaries, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate receive or grant
inappropriate benefits or use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices, we could be
confronted with legal sanctions, penalties, loss of orders and harm to our reputation. Especially given our
worldwide operations, group structure, size and the extent of our cooperation with intermediaries,
consultants and sales agents, our internal controls, policies and risk management may not be adequate. If
we are subject to an enforcement action or found to be in violation of such laws, this may result in
significant penalties, fines or sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to carry out acquisitions or mergers due to regulatory restrictions on business acquisitions and_**
**_mergers or we may become subject to antitrust regulations as a consequence of our position in certain markets._**

Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust authorities under
antitrust regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of jurisdictions. If such approvals of a
proposed acquisition or merger prove necessary, approval of the transaction may require, based on the
relevant antirust authority’s evaluation of prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that
we divest certain businesses in order to carry out the transaction. We may also be prohibited by antitrust
authorities from carrying out the transaction. Furthermore, we could, as a consequence of our strong
positions in certain of our markets, be considered by antitrust regulatory authorities to have a dominant
position which could subject us to certain limitations in our ability to act on the market by adjusting our
prices or otherwise. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our
strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our international sales are subject to risks in relation to compliance with various jurisdictions’ economic sanctions_**
**_and export control laws and regulations._**

We sell our products internationally and are therefore subject to laws of the United Kingdom, the
European Union, Australia and other jurisdictions regulating the export of our products to certain
countries. Where applicable, these laws restrict or prohibit transactions with certain countries, such as Iran,
and with certain companies and individuals identified on lists maintained by the U.S. government, the
European Union, various European Union Member States and other governments. Failure to comply with
these laws could expose us to civil and criminal prosecution and penalties, the imposition of export or
economic sanctions against us and reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_Our leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As at June 30, 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, our as adjusted net senior debt would
have been £339.3 million on a consolidated basis and our ratio of as adjusted net senior debt to Adjusted
_Pro Forma EBITDA would have been 3.0x. For computations of our as adjusted net debt and our ratio of as_
_adjusted net debt to Adjusted_ _Pro Forma EBITDA, see ‘‘Summary—Selected Pro Forma and As Adjusted_
_Financial Information—As Adjusted Financial Data of Victoria Group.’’ On the Issue Date, the Issuer_
expects to (a) issue the Notes and (b) use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, to
refinance amounts incurred under the Bridge Facility and to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in

42


-----

connection with the Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.’’_

Our leverage can have important consequences for our business and operations, including:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt
and liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital
and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation
to cash flow;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

- restricting us from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the
costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness that could further increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or_**
**_less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt, to
fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our financial strategy, we
continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities,
access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time. Any such offering or
incurrence of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be
offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest
rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt
and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt,
including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding
effect on our cash interest expense on a _pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such_
additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than
the maturity date of the Notes and our other existing debt. For example, the BGF Loan matures in 2021,
which is earlier than the maturity of the Notes. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed
with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Notes or our other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such
additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to
the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new
debt in addition to our current debt and the Notes, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing
transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section, could intensify.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital_**
**_needs to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Among other things, the Indenture will limit our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

- pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

- make certain other restricted payments;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;

- impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

43


-----

- transfer or sell assets;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

- consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain covenants that
limit our ability to incur and assume debt and require us to maintain a certain Adjusted Leverage (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in the event that drawings under the Amended
and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement exceed 35% of total commitments. Further, the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will limit, among other things, our ability to
acquire or sell certain assets, to undergo certain corporate actions (such as mergers and de-mergers) or to
create security over our assets. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and_ _‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ These covenants could_
limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions
and other business activities that may be in our interest.

If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, we will be in default under the Indenture and/or the
relevant debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or the applicable
creditors could declare the principal and accrued interest on the Notes or the applicable amounts
immediately due and payable, after any applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to
an event of default and acceleration under our other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. These restrictions could materially adversely affect our
ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in
our best interest. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.’’_

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate_**
**_or raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Amended
and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our
ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which is subject to
general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other
factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are beyond our control.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility
with commitments of £60.0 million equivalent. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from
operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations or meet other liquidity needs, we may be
required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance or restructure all or a
portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing or restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we may
be forced to, among others:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- raise additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

If any of the above were to occur, the holders of our debt may be able to accelerate our debt and, to the
extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. The type, timing and terms of any future financing,
restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the
prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any
of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we
may not have sufficient cash or sources of cash to repay all of our debt. In addition, the terms of the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures. Furthermore, any failure to make
payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could impact our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future.

44


-----

**_Drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will, and future indebtedness that we may incur
could, bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR, LIBOR or BBSY (as
applicable) as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future.
Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there
can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense
would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes_**
**_and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries and intercompany loan receivables, and therefore depends upon the receipt
of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet
its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order
to meet the obligations under the Notes through a combination of dividends, interest payments on
intercompany loans and repayment of intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will
be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and
senior subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or Guarantees of obligations
under, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash
flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. If our
subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the
Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that
would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. Further, if we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay planned
expansions or capital expenditures, sell significant assets, discontinue specified operations or obtain
additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure or refinance all or a
portion of our debt on or before maturity.

In addition, applicable tax laws may subject such payments to further taxation and applicable corporate law
may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions
on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, our ability to pay dividends to the
Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to us. Finally, the
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with
respect to any of the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet the Issuer’s obligations, they
may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in the restricted group to another
entity in the restricted group in order to make payments to the Issuer.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings
of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes
under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization,
administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims
from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent
entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In
addition, our Consolidated Group Financial Statements include both Guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries and, as such, may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Guarantors.

45

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this Offering Memorandum,
which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain hedging obligations. Upon a refinancing of the New Revolving Credit Facility, or if
the lenders under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement consent to an increase
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the amount that will benefit from super-priority security interest
in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount provided under the Indenture. The Collateral may
also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any
increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the
Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance
of the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such
Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an
orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers,
whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or
sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of
the Collateral. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for
such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a
market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the share pledges
over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy
proceeding.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the_**
**_granting of Guarantees or security interests during which such Guarantees or security interests may be challenged_**
**_in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create or restart hardening
periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting or extension of
shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may
restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of
security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence
of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new or extended security interests can
run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or extended. At each time, if
the Guarantee or security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it
may not be possible to enforce it. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the
_Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security.’’

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to_**
**_enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections as may be accepted by the Security Agent and any other creditors that have the
benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the date
the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability to
realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be
affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Specifically, the Collateral is
located in the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia, and the multijurisdictional nature of any enforcement
of the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency,
administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with,

46


-----

each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability
to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings.

In addition, the security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, under the laws in certain of the jurisdictions
where the Collateral is located, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an
appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’ Third party consent may be_
needed to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that any such consents will be obtained. We
also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale
of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents (subject to certain exceptions) will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain
in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture
would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as
selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, rather than_**
**_directly to the holders of the Notes and the Collateral to be granted by us will be granted subsequent to the issuance of_**
**_the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be
granted only in favor of the Trustee (who will accept them on behalf of the holders of the Notes) or the
Security Agent, as applicable. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that
only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. For further information,
see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations’’._

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released_**
**_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released
automatically, including:

- in connection with any asset sale or disposition or transfer of assets to a person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary, if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’;_

- upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes that complies with the provisions under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

- as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’ or ‘‘Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’;_

- in the case of property and assets and capital stock of a Guarantor, to the extent such Guarantor is
released from its Guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture;

- to the extent permitted in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’;_

47


-----

- if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture (to the extent of such restricted subsidiary’s assets and
property);

- upon repayment in full of the Notes;

- if the lien granted in favor of the New Revolving Credit Facility or such other debt that gave rise to the
obligation to grant the lien over such Collateral is released;

- as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement, including in accordance with certain enforcement
actions taken pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined in the ‘‘Description of the Notes’’, or as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

- as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

The lien on the capital stock of the Issuer will only be released as provided by the first, second, third and
fifth bullets above.

Even though the holders of the Notes share in the Collateral securing the Notes ratably with the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, the creditors under the Amended
and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control
enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders
of the Notes agree with those actions. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’

Under various circumstances, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including:

- in connection with any asset sale or disposition or transfer of assets to a person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary, if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’;_

- upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes that complies with the provisions under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

- as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’ or ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’;_

- in the case of property and assets and capital stock of a Guarantor, to the extent such Guarantor is
released from its Guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture;

- to the extent permitted in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’;_

- if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture (to the extent of such Restricted Subsidiary’s assets and
property);

- upon repayment in full of the Notes;

- if the lien granted in favor of the New Revolving Credit Facility or such other debt that gave rise to the
obligation to grant the lien over such Collateral is released;

- as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement, including in accordance with certain enforcement
actions taken pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or
as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
or

- as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal as
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party
and/or the grantor of the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be
perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the
actions required to perfect any of these security interests. In addition, certain applicable law requires that
certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property,
equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant
security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third
parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same
Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take
any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under
the relevant Security Documents. There can be no assurance that the value of the Guarantees or the
Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. However, each security interest granted
under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be
subject to that security interest or to the secured amount stated in the relevant Security Document (which
may be lower than the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest), and the
Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or
otherwise ineffective under English, Spanish, Australian or other applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and
defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, unfair or
voidable preference and insolvent transactions, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance, related party transactions, security registration or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally. For example, where proceeds from the Notes are used to
refinance the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the value of the Guarantee granted by Saloni would be
limited to the portion of Senior Secured Bridge Facilities not used to fund our acquisition of Saloni. See
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.’’_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
Guarantees and security interests can be challenged (for example, by the bankruptcy receiver or insolvency
trustee, in the case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor
outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the
beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation,
the granting by it of the Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents) or by
any party granting the security interests and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or
enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly,
subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or to the party granting the
security interests, if the court found, inter alia, that:

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

- the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or of the party granting the
security interests or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the
Guarantor or the above-referred party was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or
security interest;

- the Guarantor or the party granting the security interests did not receive fair consideration or
reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Guarantee or security interests and the

49


-----

Guarantor or such party was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or
security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/
Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity; or

- the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or of the party granting the security interests or not to be in the best interests or for the
corporate benefit of the Guarantor or of such party.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a party
granting the security interests was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the
valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on that date, or that a
court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on the
date its Guarantee was issued or its security interests were granted, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted unfair or voidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or voidable conveyances on other grounds.

The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy
the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurances that we will
have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and
Security Documents, whether or not we make dividends. The payment of dividends by a Guarantor or by
the party granting the security interests to the Issuer to service our debt obligations (including under the
Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to those Guarantors or parties to satisfy the
obligations under the Guarantees or the Security Documents. In addition, the payment under the
Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require
certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report,
shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

In addition, judgments rendered by a U.S. court will generally not be directly enforceable in Spain. Instead,
as a pre-condition to enforcing a U.S. judgment, a local court will subject the judgment to a multi-factor
test. Several of the factors the court will consider involving a considerable amount of discretion. Even if the
court ultimately finds that the judgment is enforceable, the process may require considerable time to
complete. For all of the foregoing, an investment in the Notes involves unique risks that may not apply or
may apply differently in a differently structured bond offering. If any of these risks materialize, your ability
to collect payments of principal and interest under the Notes may be materially adversely affected. See
‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgements’’ for more information.

**_The insolvency laws of the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia may not be as favorable to you as the U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, Spain and
Australia. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the
United Kingdom, Spain and Australia or another relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional
proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty
and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be
no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each
other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application
of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law
should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in
those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. For an overview of certain insolvency laws
and enforceability issues, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’ with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture, the
Issuer would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts to the date of purchase, if any. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure
you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to
provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change
of Control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay
the New Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such
an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The
ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the
Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial
resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an
event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to
the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to allow us to purchase the Notes or we may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain
such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing
to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would
be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a
default under the Indenture, which, in turn, would constitute a default under the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Change of Control.’’_

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other
similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of
Control. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control,’’ the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the applicable Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may
be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a
rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s Investors Service and a rating of BBB� or better by Standard and
Poor’s and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which such Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will
cease to be applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.’’ If these covenants were to cease to be applicable,_
the Group would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments,
which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will
ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

51


-----

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

The Notes will be new securities and currently there is no market for them. The Initial Purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. They are not, however, obliged to do so and
may discontinue market-making at any time.

As a result, we cannot assure you as to:

- the development or liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in
the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be
adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may
affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to
disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of
our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active
trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact
the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not be listed or remain listed on the London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market (the_**
**_‘‘Exchange’’)._**

We intend to list and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Exchange, as long as the Notes are
outstanding, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be listed or remain listed. If we cannot list or
maintain the listing of the Notes on the Exchange or it becomes unduly onerous to maintain such listing,
we may cease to maintain such listing on the Exchange, provided that we will use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on another ‘‘recognised stock exchange’’ (within the meaning of
Section 1005 of the U.K. Income Tax Act 2007), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be
able to do so. See also ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—UK Withholding Tax on UK Source interest.’’ Although
no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange or another
‘‘recognised listing exchange’’ for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, the delisting of the
Notes from the Exchange or another stock exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material
adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the
currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic,
political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by
reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the
effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the
return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return
on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by
U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if
any. See ‘‘Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the
United States, and our business is conducted primarily outside the United States. The directors, managers
and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In
addition, as a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and

52


-----

those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable
to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The
United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the United Kingdom,
Spain or Australia. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in the United Kingdom, Spain or
Australia of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition,
the enforcement in the United Kingdom, Spain or Australia of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.
There is also doubt that a court in the United Kingdom, Spain or Australia would have the requisite power
or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of
U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of
_Judgments.’’_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at
any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time
or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be_**
**_sold._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the
Notes or the Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and,
unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See
‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the
Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as
holders of the Notes. Our principal shareholders have, directly or indirectly, the power, among other
things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day to day operations, as well as the ability to elect
and change our management and to approve any other changes to our operations. For example, our
principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material
assets or make dividend distributions, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of our
principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal shareholders could also have
an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions
that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such transactions might involve
risks to the holders of the Notes. In addition, our principal shareholders may come to own businesses that
directly compete with our business.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in exchange
for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depository (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal,

53


-----

interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will
be made to HSBC Bank plc, as principal paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will not have any
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There
can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to
enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event, U.S. investors
generally will be required to include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a
constant yield accrual method, regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. As a result, U.S. investors will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of
cash attributable to such income. For more information, see ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.’’_

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

See ‘‘Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the reports of Grant Thornton UK LLP, the independent
auditors of the Group in respect of the Consolidated Group Financial Statements. In accordance with
guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent
auditor’s reports from Grant Thornton UK LLP state that: the reports including the opinions were
prepared for and only for the members of the Group as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other purpose; the independent auditors did not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by their prior consent in writing.
The independent auditor’s reports for the Group issued by Grant Thornton UK LLP as of and for the
2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years were unqualified. The independent auditor’s reports for the Group as
of and for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditor has
confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes)
other than to the Group and its members as a body with respect to the reports and to the independent
auditor’s audit work and opinions. The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (the
‘‘SEC’’) would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus
used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report
filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting
language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its
report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the aggregate gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be A450.0 million
(assuming the Notes are issued at par). On the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering to
repay the Bridge Facility and, together with cash on hand, pay the fees and expenses in connection with the
Offering. We used drawings under the Bridge Facility, together with the proceeds of the Equity Placement:
(i) to fund the consideration payable for our acquisition of Saloni on August 7, 2018, (ii) to repay the
Saloni Legacy Indebtedness, (iii) to repay the amounts drawn under the Legacy Revolving Credit Facility
and other existing indebtedness of the Victoria Group; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Offering.
Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from
our estimates of fees, expenses and commissions. For descriptions of our current and anticipated
indebtedness following the offering of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, see ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Capitalization.’’_

(a) Reflects the conversion of Saloni’s consolidated balance sheet data from Spanish GAAP to IFRS. There are no material
differences as between Saloni’s balance sheet data as of June 30, 2018 as presented in accordance with Spanish GAAP and as
presented in accordance with IFRS. For a discussion of certain of the differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS, see
_‘‘Annex A: Summary of Certain Differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS.’’_

**_Note 3—Saloni Acquisition Adjustments_**

On August 7, 2018, the Victoria Group acquired Saloni for cash consideration of A96.7 million
(£86.2 million). We financed the acquisition of Saloni through (i) the Equity Placement raising gross
proceeds of £60.5 million and (ii) drawings under the A445.0 million (£394.0 million) Bridge Facility. We
used the remaining proceeds in excess of the cash consideration payable for the Saloni acquisition to (i) to
repay the Legacy Saloni Indebtedness, (ii) to repay drawings under the Legacy Revolving Credit Facility,
(iii) to repay term loan indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of Keraben, (vi) to pay fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Saloni and (v) for general corporate purposes.

The unaudited condensed consolidated income statement data of Saloni for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2018 has been adjusted to give _pro forma effect to (i) the financing costs associated with the_
acquisition of Saloni as if the acquisition had occurred on July 2, 2017 and (ii) the amortization of acquired
intangibles as if the acquisition of Saloni had occurred on July 2, 2017. For purposes of the financing

-----

adjustment, we have assumed a rate of interest of 2.75%, which we believe reflects the rate of interest we
could have obtained for permanent financing based on our acquisition of Keraben in 2017, and excluded
A17.0 million of finance income relating to a write down of debt at Saloni under previous ownership.

**_Note 4—Acquisition of Keraben_**

The results of operations of Keraben have been consolidated with those of the Victoria Group since
November 16, 2017. The acquisition of Keraben was financed through (i) an equity placement of new
ordinary shares by the Issuer raising gross proceeds of £180.0 million and (ii) the draw-down of
A178 million under a syndicated term loan facility with a per annum interest rate equal to 2.75% when
leverage is at or below 3.0x.

This adjustment represents the unaudited condensed consolidated income statement data of Keraben for
the period from July 2, 2017 to November 15, 2017, prepared solely for the purposes of the _pro forma_
condensed consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018. The historical financial
information of Keraben for the period from July 2, 2017 to November 15, 2017 has been (i) extracted from
the accounting records of Keraben, (ii) presented in accordance with IFRS, (iii) translated from euro into
pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.122 = £1.00, which was the period average from July 2, 2017 to
November 15, 2017, (iv) adjusted to give _pro forma effect to the financing costs associated with the_
acquisition of Keraben as if the acquisition had occurred on July 2, 2017, and (v) the amortization of
acquired intangibles as if the acquisition of Keraben had occurred on July 2, 2017. There are no material
differences as between Keraben’s income statement data for the period from July 2, 2017 to November 15,
2017 as presented in accordance with Spanish GAAP and as presented in accordance with IFRS. For a
discussion of certain of the differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS, see _‘‘Annex A: Summary of_
_Certain Differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS.’’_

Exceptional items for Keraben for the period from July 2, 2017 to November 15, 2017 principally relate to
costs incurred in the cancellation of existing financing arrangements and financial expenses in relation to
certain management incentive plans triggered by the acquisition of Keraben by the Victoria Group.

**_Note 5—Saloni Financing Adjustments_**

This adjustment gives pro forma effect to the £60.5 million Equity Placement together with our drawing of
A445.0 million under the Bridge Facility (i) to fund a portion of the consideration payable for our
acquisition of Saloni; (ii) to repay certain Saloni Legacy Indebtedness; (iii) to repay the Legacy Revolving
Credit Facility and other existing indebtedness of the Group; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.

**_Note 6—Saloni Purchase Price Allocation_**

On August 7, 2018, the Victoria Group acquired Saloni. The consideration transferred includes (i) the
purchase of the shares valued at A96.7 million and (ii) the repayment of existing net indebtedness of
£61.0 million. We have assumed a useful economic life of 15 years for intangible assets. The acquisition of
Saloni is being accounted for using the acquisition method as defined by IFRS. This unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared on the basis of preliminary estimates of
fair values, which have been based on the percentages resulting from the final purchase price allocation
calculation of the Keraben acquisition. The actual amounts and the allocation between tangible assets,
goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill ultimately recorded may differ materially from the
information presented herein. The preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed reflected herein are subject to change based upon completion of the valuation of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**
**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in_
_conjunction with the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial Data and Non-GAAP Measures’’ and_
_‘‘Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data’’ as well as with the Consolidated_
_Group Financial Statements and the related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._
_The following discussion includes forward-looking statements which, although based on assumptions and/or_

_conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a_
_discussion of some of those risks and uncertainties, please refer to the sections entitled ‘‘Forward-Looking_
_Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’._

_We prepare our financial statements on the basis of a 52-week or 53-week financial period. For the purposes of_
_this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2018 as the ‘‘2018 financial year’’, the_
_52 weeks ended April 1, 2017 as the ‘‘2017 financial year’’ and the 53 weeks ended April 2, 2016 as the ‘‘2016_
_financial year’’. The 2018 financial year and the 2017 financial year were 52-week periods, however the 2016_
_financial year was a 53-week financial period. Consequently, unless otherwise indicated, our results for the 2016_

_Victoria PLC and its subsidiaries._

**Overview**

We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United
Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. We are the
largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia
and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We are also a
leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. We manufacture and supply a range of carpet,
ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, luxury vinyl tile (‘‘LVT’’), artificial grass and flooring accessories. The
majority of our products are for residential use and are sold through our retail customer base. We
primarily target mid- to upper-market product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche
product segments. For the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018, we generated £630.6 million of Adjusted Pro
_Forma Revenue and £111.7 million of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (17.7% Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA_
margin). While we have grown over this period largely through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth
was 2.8%, 4.6% and 1.6% (adjusted for the restructuring of certain UK operations and the impact of a
weather-related business interruption).

**Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity have been influenced in the periods discussed in
this Offering Memorandum by the following events, facts, developments and market characteristics. We
believe that these factors are likely to continue to influence our operations in the future.

**_Product and Geographic Mix_**

We offer an extensive range of mid- to upper-market flooring products in a variety of designs across our
hard and soft-flooring product segments, which comprise ceramic tiles, carpet, underlay and accessories
and LVT. As the margins on our products vary, changes in the mix of our product sales have a direct impact
on our total revenue and profitability. We typically achieve higher margins on sales in our hard flooring
segments, and, as a result, growth in these product segments relative to our soft-flooring segments
generally results in improved overall profitability. The margins in our hard flooring segment are typically
higher than the margins in our soft-flooring segment because, in Continental Europe and globally, demand
for hard-flooring products is high, with supply concentrated in small pockets of regional expertise. The fact
that the design of hard-flooring products tends to be more varied and intricate also contributes to their
higher margins. In order to take advantage of the higher margins in the hard flooring segment, we
expanded into the ceramic tile (a type of hard flooring product) market through our acquisitions of Serra
and Keraben in 2017 and through our recent acquisition of Saloni in 2018. The resulting shift in our

67


-----

product mix has been a significant factor in increasing our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin from_
13.8% in the 2017 financial year to 17.7% in the 2018 financial year.

Additionally, our range of products have varying margins in the different geographic regions in which we
operate and, therefore, our geographic mix impacts our results of operation. Through our acquisitions of
Serra, Keraben and Saloni, whose end markets are across Continental Europe, we have significantly
broadened the geographic diversity of our sales. In 2018, we sold our products in more than 20 countries
globally. The United Kingdom, Australia, Spain and France are our largest markets, representing 41%,
17%, 14% and 7% of our revenue, respectively, for the 2018 financial year, pro forma for the Acquisitions.
While historically the majority of our revenues have come from the United Kingdom, Continental Europe
and Australia represent growing markets for our products. In the case of Continental Europe, this
geographical segment has gone from representing 3% of our Pro Forma Revenue in the 2017 financial year
to 26% in the 2018 financial year.

**_Consumer Preference and Demand_**

Based on the composition of our customer base, we believe that the substantial majority of our revenues
are generated in the I&R end-market. We focus on the I&R end-market as it is four to five times larger
than the new construction end-market in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Consumer
decisions regarding the redecoration and renovation of existing properties are therefore a major driver of
our business. Our business is therefore affected by our ability to design and manufacture new and
attractive products in-line with consumer preferences as well as overall consumer demand in the I&R
end-market.

Consumers typically base their decision to purchase our products on a broad range of factors, including
color, design, texture, shape, dimensions, pile height and density, price and other structural and technical
features. In order to satisfy this broad range of preferences, we have built a portfolio of over 30 brands,
have experienced design teams that are specific to these brands and have well-invested manufacturing
equipment to support new product lines and adapt to shifts in demand. We aim to have optimal reach
across the mid- and upper-market in our product segments, which allows us to deliver strong and
sustainable margins.

Demand for new flooring in the I&R end-market is typically less volatile than the new construction
end-market. As the I&R end-market is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to
upgrade the appearance of existing homes, this market is characterized by greater price inelasticity and less
susceptibility to fluctuations in the business cycle. While impacted by macroeconomic factors such as GDP
growth, the level of employment, real wage levels and consumer confidence, we believe that demand for
flooring in the I&R end-market is, to a certain degree, less susceptible to short-term macroeconomic
fluctuations, as consumers can decide to repair or upgrade their flooring independently of other home
improvement decisions.

We seek to follow consumer preferences and demand trends closely, using a systematic approach to
collection planning, and maintaining a short design-to-product cycle. Our design, quality control,
production and cost control processes are mutually reinforcing, resulting in product specifications that
align with our target customers and price points while ensuring optimal margins. We have the ability to set
up our machines and re-engineer our production facilities, as well as increase our production capacity to
manufacture new and different products in response to changing trends and consumer preferences. In
addition, the breadth of our product offerings and our ability to redeploy our machines to make new
designs makes us less subject to the success or failure of any given collection.

**_Cost Base and Operational Improvements_**

We are a manufacturer and therefore rely on well-invested production equipment, labor and raw materials
to run our business. Of our cost of sales in the 2018 financial year, materials comprised 73.9%, labor
comprised 15.0% and overhead comprised 11.1% (pro forma for the Acquisitions).

We are dependent on certain key raw materials, including synthetic yarn, wool, clay and polyurethane
foam, and therefore our margins are impacted by variations in the cost of these raw materials. We manage
the purchase of our key raw materials carefully, leveraging our scale and engaging with multiple suppliers
in order to optimize pricing. See ‘‘—Macroeconomic Factors—Raw Material Expenses.’’

Despite being a manufacturing business, we have a relatively low fixed cost base as a result of our
automation of certain processes as well as the fact that our equipment generally has a very long useful life,

68


-----

given proper maintenance. We estimate that 54% of our costs (46% of our cost base as a percentage of our
revenues) for the 2018 financial year (pro forma for the Acquisitions) vary directly with revenue. A further
31% of our costs (26% of our cost base as a percentage of revenues) for the 2018 financial year (pro forma
for the Acquisitions) is semi-variable, in respect of which we have the ability to adapt within a few months.
In order to ensure that our manufacturing process is nimble and cost-effective, we are required to
periodically make capital investments in our plant and equipment, which is further translated into
depreciation on our income statement. Additionally, our business requires a limited amount of
maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash flows; of our capital expenditures for the
2018 financial year, £14.1 million related to maintenance and £15.2 million related to growth.

Further, following the acquisition of a new business, we look to realize operating cost synergies in order to
drive margin enhancements. The purpose of these initiatives is to drive better buying terms with suppliers
of raw materials, better working capital management through SKU reduction and rationalization of
product lines and manufacturing assets. Realizing these operating synergies improves our margins by
allowing us to manufacture our products more efficiently, including across a wide range of different SKUs,
and allowing us to plan our production requirements in-line with shifts in demand. We organize our
operations so that we can flexibly shift production in-line with changes to product specifications and to
accommodate new designs.

Through our acquisitions since 2013, we have significantly increased the scale of our operations in the
United Kingdom and in the carpet segment, in particular. As a result of this increased scale, and to
optimize our cost structure, we embarked on two restructuring initiatives in the United Kingdom: one with
respect to manufacturing and one with respect to logistics. In 2017, we closed our Kidderminster factory,
resulting in our UK carpet production now being shared between factories located in Yorkshire and South
Wales. We recently announced a similar initiative in Australia, which will result in the consolidation of our
two underlay factories into a single, enlarged facility. We also began the relocation of our Midlands
Distribution Center and opened our Southern Distribution Center near London. We are still in the process
of refining the multi-site operation of these distribution centers. The total cost of these projects incurred in
the 2018 financial year was £4.5 million plus certain one-off capital expenditures equal to approximately
£3.3 million.

**_Business Relationships and Customer Success_**

We generally operate a business-to-business sales model and therefore rarely access the end-consumer
directly. Therefore we rely on our customers’ ability to sell and market our products effectively in order to
increase our revenue and generate sustainable cash flows. As our customers grow, they tend also to
increase their orders with us. We thus seek to maintain strong relationships with our customers and work
side-by-side with them to help increase store traffic and grow their business.

We predominantly focus on selling directly to retailers, which represent approximately 80% of Group
revenue for the 2018 financial year on a _pro forma basis for the Spanish Acquisitions. Approximately_
two-thirds of our direct sales to retailers are made to specialist retailers, with the rest going to either
national retail chains or DIY retailers. We also sell certain of our products in certain jurisdictions to
wholesalers where there is a structural or commercial rationale for doing so, and engage in a small amount
of contract work for the construction or hospitality industry representing approximately 10% of Group
revenue for the 2018 financial year on a pro forma basis for the Spanish Acquisitions. We have developed
what we believe are deep, longstanding relationships with our customers. We benefit from a broad range of
customers with little concentration. For the 2018 financial year, on a pro forma basis for the Acquisitions,
our top ten customers constituted 15% of total revenue, with our largest customer constituting
approximately 4% of total revenue. In addition to ensuring low customer concentration, this diverse
network of independent retailer customers presents a significant barrier to entry for new market
participants.

**_Macroeconomic Factors_**

_General Economic Conditions and Industry Environment_

Our results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, as well as the conditions affecting
consumer spending on flooring in the markets in which we operate. Such conditions include levels of
employment, consumer confidence, inflation, growth in GDP, real disposable income, currency exchange
rates, interest rates, home prices and the availability of consumer credit. All of the markets in which we
operate were adversely impacted by the global economic downturn that started in 2008. Nevertheless, the

69


-----

Group was resilient throughout the financial crisis, increasing revenue in each year of the
2006–2011 financial period. While we shifted our sales mix to lower than average selling prices to protect
sales volumes, we were able to utilize our flexible cost base to protect our margins. As macroeconomic
indicators like GDP, real wages and employment levels have improved across the United Kingdom,
Continental Europe and Australia, we have seen an increase in the rate of growth in the flooring market.

Overall economic conditions typically have a direct impact on the specific markets that drive our business,
although market sensitivity varies, depending on the product. Our business is focused on the I&R
end-market, which is less susceptible to the effects of an economic downturn than the new construction
end-market, which typically fluctuates in-line with the overall business cycle. Additionally, we target the
mid- and upper-markets of the flooring market, which have historically been more resilient during
economic downturns.

During an economic downturn, raw material prices typically decrease, which can mitigate the adverse
effect of potential volume decreases. We also believe that our strategic goal of expanding our presence in
Continental Europe and Australia have increased our geographic and product diversification, and thereby
allow us to further mitigate the impact of changes in local and regional economic conditions and consumer
preferences. For example, uncertainty around the United Kingdom and Eurozone economic outlooks,
driven by the forthcoming exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, is mitigated by the
operational independence of our United Kingdom and Continental European divisions and the fact that
neither is heavily reliant on imports or exports.

_Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_

We operate internationally and, as a result, are exposed to changes in the value of our operational
currencies, the pound sterling, the euro, the Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar. For the 2018 financial
year, 58% of our revenue was denominated in pound sterling, 26% of our revenue was denominated in
Australian dollars, and 16% of our revenue was denominated in euro. As a consequence, we have
considerable cash flow, earnings and assets in currencies other than our reporting currency, which is the
pound sterling. Our exposure to changes in exchange rates may be described in terms of translation
exposure and transaction exposure. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business—We
_are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.’’_

Translation risk is the risk that exchange rates impact the value of our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities
reported in pounds sterling in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The weakening of the pound
sterling relative to our other operational currencies will result in an increase in our revenues and costs as
reported in pounds sterling. For example, since the national referendum in the United Kingdom on Brexit
in June 2016, the value of the pound sterling relative our other operational currencies has declined,
resulting in an increase in our reported revenues and costs.

In addition, the substantial majority of our debt is, and will continue to be following the Offering,
denominated in euro and therefore the amount of our reported indebtedness is subject to currency-related
fluctuations when translated into pounds sterling for inclusion in our financial statements at period-end
exchange rates. Additionally, as 61% of our _Pro Forma EBITDA is denominated in euro, there is a_
disparity between the currency mix of our debt and the currency mix of our income.

Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional
currency. As a result of our operational structure, our exposure to currency transaction risk is relatively
limited, with 85% of our costs denominated in the relevant local operating currency in the 2018 financial
year. Our primary transactional risk exposure comes in the form of raw material purchases by our United
Kingdom and Australian divisions, in which sales are predominantly denominated in pounds sterling and
Australian dollars, respectively, but which have costs denominated in euro and U.S. dollars (7% and 11%,
respectively). Our Continental European ceramic tile businesses have very little transactional risk
exposure. We mitigate our limited transactional risk through forward exchange contracts up to 12 months
in advance to hedge our residual exposure to currencies other than the pound sterling. See ‘‘—Qualitative
_and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk—Foreign Exchange Risk.’’_

Fluctuations in the value of the euro and Australian dollar relative to the pound sterling typically have a
short-term impact on our gross margin as, on the revenue side, both we and our customers seek to adjust
prices in response to foreign currency fluctuations. On the expense side, both we and our suppliers also
seek to adjust prices. In addition, our industry is competitive and elastic, as demonstrated by price
rebalancing across the industry in response to foreign currency and raw material price fluctuations.

70


-----

Changes in foreign exchange rates also have an impact on the competitive dynamics within our markets, in
particular with respect to our UK carpet business. As the majority of carpeting in the United Kingdom is
imported from competitors in Continental Europe, the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the
euro increases our competitive advantage in this market. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry
_and Business—We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.’’_

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australian dollar against the pound sterling over the full year
would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in our post-tax profit for the year of
£0.7 million (2017: increased our post-tax profit by £0.2 million; 2016: increased our post-tax profit by
£0.3 million). A 10% weakening of the Australian dollar against the pound sterling, on the same basis, have
decreased Group post-tax profit by £0.6 million (2017: decreased Group post-tax profit by £0.1 million;
2016: decreased Group post-tax profit by £0.2 million).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australian dollar against the pound sterling at year-end rates
would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase to equity of £2.2 million (2017: an
increase of £2.1 million; 2016: an increase of £1.5 million). A 10% weakening of the Australian dollar
against the pound sterling would, on the same basis, have decreased equity by £1.8 million (2017: decrease
of £1.7 million; 2016: decrease of £1.2 million).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the euro against the pound sterling over the full year would, all other
variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in Group post-tax profit for the year of £0.3 million. A
10% weakening in the euro against the pound sterling would, on the same basis, have increased Group
post-tax profit by £0.3 million.

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the euro against pound sterling at year-end rates would have resulted
in a decrease to equity of £0.3 million. A 10% weakening in the euro against the pound sterling would, on
the same basis, have increased equity by £0.2 million.

_Raw Materials Expenses_

Raw materials constitute the majority of our production costs. Our key raw material inputs are: (i) with
respect to carpets, synthetic yarn; (ii) with respect to ceramics, clay and natural gas; and (iii) with respect to
underlay, polyurethane foam trim. As supply for these inputs is relatively unconstrained, our underlying
raw material expenses do not typically exhibit significant volatility. In any event, we seek to pass-through
any increases in raw material prices to our customers. Additionally, we have a broad range of suppliers,
with our top ten suppliers constituting only 18% of our total expenditure with third parties, for the 2018
financial year after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisitions. In some instances, prices are fixed pursuant
to long-term agreements but, more commonly, the Group purchases strategically using competitive
processes. We typically review prices every six to 12 months. The primary source of volatility with respect to
our raw material expenses is currency risk, primarily with respect to synthetic yarn and polyurethane foam
trim, which we purchase in euro and U.S. dollars. See ‘‘—Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations.’’

**_Acquisitions_**

Our acquisition strategy is primarily focused on our targets as stand-alone propositions. We seek to acquire
businesses that are growing and profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive
advantages in production and distribution. In line with our commitment to sustainable growth, we look to a
combination of equity and debt funding to acquire material businesses and to maintain leverage levels in
line with our historical performance and financial policy.

In August 2015, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Quest Carpet Manufacturers
Pty Ltd. and Quest Carpet Manufacturers Unit Trust (together ‘‘Quest Carpets’’) for initial cash
consideration of AUD $15.3 million (£7.1 million) and deferred cash consideration of AUD $10.5 million
(£4.5 million) paid over the next three succeeding years. The principal activity of Quest Carpets is the
design, manufacture and distribution of carpets across Australia and New Zealand. The business operates
from facilities in Dandenong, near Melbourne, Australia and employs a workforce of 89 people. Quest
Carpets was viewed as being highly complementary to our existing business in Australia. The Group results
for the 2016 financial year included AUD $42.0 million (£20.6 million) of revenue and AUD $4.1 million
(£2.0 million) of profit before tax from Quest Carpets. Quest Carpets’ results have been consolidated with
our own from the date of its acquisition in August 2015.

In September 2015, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Interfloor Group Limited
(‘‘Interfloor Group’’) for cash consideration of £14.0 million. The principal activity of Interfloor Group is the

71


-----

design, manufacture and distribution of carpet underlay and related accessories. The business operates in
the United Kingdom from facilities in Haslingden in Lancashire, England, and Dumfries in Scotland, and
employs a workforce of more than 300 people. The acquisition of Interfloor Group provided a number of
commercial, operational and financial benefits to the Group. The Group results for the 2016 financial year
included £41.1 million of revenue and £6.0 million of profit before tax from Interfloor Group. Interfloor
Group’s results have been consolidate with our own from the date of its acquisition in September 2016.

In October 2016, the Group acquired the business and assets of Ezi Floor Limited (‘‘Ezi Floor’’) for initial
cash consideration of £6.5 million and deferred cash consideration of £6.5 million payable over the next
four succeeding years. Ezi Floor benefits from a modern, well-equipped, manufacturing facility near
Bradford, Yorkshire, and is a manufacturer and distributor of a range of underlay and flooring accessories
for both the residential and contract end-markets. Ezi Floor sells to wholesalers, retail groups, and
independent stores throughout the United Kingdom. The acquisition of Ezi Floor is highly complementary
to our existing businesses, with the addition of underlay and hard flooring ranges to our product portfolio,
which previously consisted of only broadloom carpet and carpet tiles. The Group results for the 2017
financial year included contribution from Ezi Floor of £4.4 million of revenue and £1.2 million of
underlying profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and reorganization
costs). Ezi Floor’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in October
2016.

In January 2017, the Group acquired the business and assets of Dunlop Flooring through a newly
incorporated company in Australia, Primary Flooring Pty Ltd. (‘‘Dunlop Flooring’’), for cash consideration
of AUD $36.4 million (£22.4 million), which continues to trade under the Dunlop Flooring name. The
acquisition of Dunlop Flooring is highly complementary to our existing businesses in Australia with the
addition of underlay and hard flooring ranges to our product portfolio that previously consisted of only
broadloom carpet and carpet tiles. The Group results for the 2017 financial year included contribution
from Dunlop Flooring AUD $8.7 million (£5.0 million) of revenue and AUD $0.8 million (£0.5 million) of
underlying profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and reorganization
costs). Dunlop Flooring’s results have been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in
January 2017.

In February 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of GrassInc and Avalon for initial cash
consideration of A11.2 million (£9.5 million) and deferred consideration of A5.1 million (£4.3 million)
payable over the next four succeeding years, with additional deferred consideration of A8.8 million
(£7.5 million) payable over the same period subject to improved EBITDA and other criteria. These
acquisitions have allowed the Group to expand to the artificial grass market, which has and continues to
show robust growth in the global market. These acquisitions are complementary to our existing expertise,
as the artificial grass manufacturing process is virtually identical to the carpet manufacturing process. The
Group results for the 2017 financial year included contributions from Avalon and GrassInc of A3.0 million
(£2.6 million) of revenue and A0.7 million (£0.6 million) of underlying profit before tax (before
amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and reorganization costs). GrassInc’s and Avalon’s results
have been consolidated with our own from the date of their acquisitions in February 2017.

In November 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Keraben for total consideration of
A274.1 million (£243.4 million). Keraben, which is based in Castell´on, Spain, designs, manufactures and
distributes a range of mid- to upper-market white body and porcelain tiles for both wall and floor covering.
The enlarged group, containing three brands with strong market reputation, is substantially diversified in
terms of both product and geography and is an ideal platform for further potential acquisitions in the
ceramic flooring segment. The Group results for the 2018 financial year included contribution from
Keraben of A46.8 million (£41.1 million) of revenue and A10.8 million (£9.5 million) of profit before tax
(before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Keraben’s results have been
consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in November 2017.

In December 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Serra for initial cash consideration of
A38.1 million (£33.6 million) and deferred cash consideration of up to A20.0 million (£17.7 million) payable
over the next four succeeding years. Serra, which is based in Serramazzoni, Italy, sells and exports ceramic
tiles domestically and abroad, selling to a combination of wholesalers, retail groups and independent stores
throughout Continental Europe, North America and Asia. The Group results for the 2018 financial year
included contribution from Serra of A6.5 million (£5.7 million) of revenue and A2.5 million (£2.2 million) of
profit before tax (before amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition costs). Serra’s results have
been consolidated with our own from the date of its acquisition in December 2017.

-----

In August 2018, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Saloni from Obinesa Grupo Industrial S.L.
for cash consideration of A96.7 million (£86.2 million). The acquisition further drives our expansion in the
Continental European ceramic flooring segment and presents opportunities for synergies with our existing
businesses. Pro forma for the acquisition, the Group results for the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 would
have included contribution from Saloni of A115.2 million (£102.0 million) of revenue and A15.5 million
(£13.7 million) of EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Euro
amounts have been converted into pounds sterling at a rate equal to A1.129 = £1.00, which was the period
average for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018.

**_Seasonality_**

Our carpet and underlay sales in the United Kingdom and Australia have historically been slightly higher
in September, October and November, driven by an increase in home improvement activity in advance of
the holiday season. Our ceramic flooring sales in Continental Europe are less susceptible to seasonal
variation, with August, December and January being our slow months as home improvement activity tapers
off during and following holidays. Sales of artificial grass are the most susceptible to seasonal variation,
with demand being highest between April and August in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
Our working capital is highest just prior to the seasonal peak; given the lack of seasonal variation in our
ceramic flooring segment and the small scale of our artificial grass segment, this means our working capital
tends to be at its highest in September and October of each year.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results**

**_Financial Periods_**

We prepare our financial statements on the basis of a 52-week or 53-week financial period. Results for
financial years that include 53 weeks (including the 2016 financial year) are not directly comparable to
results from financial years that include 52 weeks. Accordingly, the historical results presented may not be
directly comparable to results from other financial periods.

**_The Transactions_**

As a result of the Transactions, our leverage and interest expense will increase considerably in the periods
following the consummation of the Transactions. As of June 30, 2018, we had £253.6 million of outstanding
net senior indebtedness and, after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had_
£339.3 million of outstanding net senior indebtedness on a consolidated basis. Additionally, pro forma for
the Transactions, the substantial majority of our indebtedness will be denominated in euro. To the extent
that the pound sterling/euro exchange rate varies, the pound sterling equivalent amount due upon
repayment of the principal amount could increase.

**Description of Key Components of Our Income Statement**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration receivable by the Group for goods
supplied, excluding VAT and trade discounts. Revenue is recognized upon the sale of goods or transfer of
risk to the customer.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable expenses (excluding VAT and trade discounts) incurred from revenue
generating activity, including cost of materials and production costs, labor costs and depreciation from the
manufacture of goods.

**_Distribution costs_**

Distribution costs include the cost of warehousing (including labor), internal transportation costs
(including labor) and the cost of using third-party logistics providers.

73


-----

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses represents design and development costs, sales and marketing costs, operating
lease rentals, losses on disposal of fixed assets, professional fees, salaries, information technology, human
resources and other administrative costs.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income includes income from renting portions of our properties, sale of excess stock to
auction houses, government grants and the generation and sale to the local power grid of electricity
generated through Keraben’s manufacturing process.

**_Depreciation and amortization_**

Depreciation represents the depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Amortization represents the
amortization of intangible assets, including the amortization of capitalized development costs.

**_Non-underlying items_**

Non-underlying items are material non-trading costs and non-underlying finance costs as determined by
the Board. They are disclosed separately in the Consolidated Group Financial Statements in order to fairly
present the results for the period. Non-underlying items include intangible amortization, the release of
prepaid arrangement fees on refinanced bank facilities, BGF Loan redemption premium charges,
mark-to-market adjustments on foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, deferred and
contingent consideration fair value adjustments, deferred tax charges in respect of non-qualifying sampling
assets and retranslation of foreign currency loans. For more information, see the ‘‘Significant Accounting
Policies’’ section in the 2018 Group Financial Statements.

**_Exceptional items_**

Exceptional items are operating costs which are material by virtue of their size or incidence but are not
expected to be recurring.

**_Finance Costs_**

Finance costs are comprised of interest payable on loans, amortization of prepaid finance costs, interest
accrued on the BGF Loan, net interest expense on defined benefit pensions and other non-underlying
finance costs.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation is comprised of the current year’s tax charge and deferred tax. The standard rate of tax applied to
our reported profit was 36.0% in the 2016 financial year, 32.9% in the 2017 financial year and 35.6% in the
2018 financial year.

**_Loss from discontinued operations_**

Profit or loss from discontinued operations represents the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations
and the post-tax gain or loss resulting from disposals, including prior year components, and is presented as
a single movement in the statement of comprehensive income. In the 2016 financial year, we disposed of
our wholly owned subsidiary, Westwood Yarns Limited, for which we received cash consideration of
£0.4 million and recognized a net loss on the disposal of £1.85 million.

**_Non-GAAP Measures_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we have included references to certain Non-GAAP Measures, including
Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA margin. We define Underlying EBITDA as earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and exceptional items.

We define Underlying EBITDA margin as Underlying EBITDA divided by revenue.

These Non-GAAP Measures are included in this Offering Memorandum because management believes
they are useful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as additional measures of
performance. These Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be

74


-----

considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Data and Non-GAAP Measures—Non-IFRS and
_Non-Spanish GAAP Measures,’’ ‘‘Summary Pro Forma_ _and As Adjusted_ _Financial Information,’’ and_
‘‘Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data.’’

See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of certain factors that could affect
our future performance and results of operation.

_Revenue_

During the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018, our revenue increased by £40.6 million, or 42.7%, to
£135.6 million from £95.0 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. The increase in revenue was
primarily due to the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of
Keraben and Serra, as well as foreign exchange translation effects, our revenue would have increased by
3.9% to £97.5 million, despite softer trading conditions in our traditional carpet and underlay markets
compared to the prior year. Overall like-for-like revenue growth would have been higher after adjusting for
the business interruption impact of a partial roof collapse due to heavy snow at our South Wales factory in

early March. This growth has been driven by the company’s strategy to use competitive product positioning
to drive volume and market share growth.

_Revenue by geographical segment_

The following table sets forth our revenue for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 and the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018, by geographical segment.

**13 weeks ended** **13 weeks ended**
**July 1, 2017** **June 30, 2018**
**(£ million)**
**Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **95.0** **135.6**

_By geographical segment:_
UK & Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65.8 109.7
Australia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29.2 25.9

**UK & Europe:** Our revenue from UK & Europe increased by £43.9 million, or 66.7%, to £109.7 million for
the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from £65.8 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra.

**Australia:** Our revenue from Australia decreased by £3.3 million, or 11.4%, to £25.9 million for the
13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from £29.2 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This represents a
decline of 5.8% in constant currency terms, with a significant translational currency impact. This decrease
was primarily due to a buoyant local housing market in the prior period which has comparatively softened
in the last 12 months.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by £23.3 million, or 35.8%, to £88.3 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018
from £65.0 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the
acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased by
3.3 percentage points from 68.4% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 to 65.1% for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018.

_Gross profit_

Gross profit increased by £17.3 million, or 57.7%, to £47.3 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018
from £30.0 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Our gross profit margin increased by
3.3 percentage points from 31.6% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 to 34.9% for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018. The increase in gross profit margin was driven in part by our evolving product mix,
reflecting the addition of higher-margin ceramic flooring products from our acquisitions of Keraben and
Serra, which represented 28.1% of sales in the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018. This has been partially offset
by lower margins in certain product categories where our strategy to drive volume and market share
growth has increased focus on lower priced products, which attract slightly lower margins.

Operational improvements, including ongoing review of our raw material prices and the closure of our
Kidderminster factory in 2017, continue to have a positive impact on gross profit margin.

_Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_

Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £6.5 million, or
87.8%, to £13.9 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from £7.4 million for the 13 weeks ended
July 1, 2017. Distribution costs increased by £2.1 million, or 15.2%, to £15.9 million for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 from £13.8 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. These increases were primarily due
to the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra.

In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs have, as a percentage of revenue,
remained broadly stable, reducing from 22.3% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 to 22.0% for the
13 weeks ended June 30, 2018.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income was £0.7 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018, compared to £nil for the
13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This income primarily relates to the sale to the local power grid of electricity
generated as a byproduct of the manufacturing process from Keraben’s combined heat and power plant.

_Underlying operating profit_

Underlying operating profit increased by £9.4 million, or 106.8%, to £18.2 million for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 from £8.8 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Our underlying operating profit
margin increased by 4.1 percentage points from 9.3% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 to 13.4% for the
13 weeks ended June 30, 2018.

_Finance costs_

Our underlying finance costs increased by £1.9 million, or 146.2%, to £3.2 million for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 from £1.3 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This reflects the increased level of
financial debt we have incurred as our business has grown, with debt (as well as equity) being used to
partially fund the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Reported net finance costs (after the inclusion of
non-underlying items) increased by £0.3 million, or 15.8%, to £2.2 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30,
2018 from £1.9 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This was impacted by foreign exchange
translation gain in the period of £1.3 million.

_Taxation_

The reported corporation tax charge for the period increased by £1.1 million, or 64.7%, to £2.8 million for
the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from £1.7 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. The underlying
tax charge of £3.8 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018, when measured against underlying profit
before tax, represents an effective tax rate of 25.3%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of
£2.0 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 representing an effective tax rate of 26.7%. The lower
effective tax rate is driven by the increase in the proportion of profits generated from the UK & Europe
segment versus the Australia segment.

_Underlying EBITDA_

Underlying EBITDA increased by £11.6 million, or 97.5%, to £23.5 million for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 from £11.9 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra. Our Underlying EBITDA margin increased by 4.8 percentage
points from 12.5% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 to 17.3% for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018, also
primarily due to the improvement in gross profit margin.

_Revenue_

During the 2018 financial year, our revenue increased by £94.4 million, or 28.6%, to £424.8 million from
£330.4 million for the 2017 financial year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisitions of
Keraben and Serra during the year, as well as the full-year impact of the consolidation of acquisitions made
in the prior year. Underlying trading conditions in our traditional carpet and underlay markets were
slightly softer in the 2018 financial year compared to the prior year, in particular during the second half.
Despite this, the Group experienced like-for-like revenue growth of 1.2% after adjusting for the impact of
acquired and restructured entities, and 1.6% (adjusted for the restructuring of certain UK operations and
the impact of a weather-related business interruption). This increase was primarily attributable to an
increase in sales volumes, partially offset by a drop in average selling price due to a change in sales mix and
a strategic decision to remain highly competitive on pricing in certain product segments in order to drive
increases in market share. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra, during the 2018
financial year as well as exchange rate fluctuations, our revenue would have increased by 1.2% to
£334.4 million. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes partially offset by a
drop in average selling price due to a change in sales mix and a strategic decision to remain highly
competitive on pricing in order to drive increases in market share.

UK & Europe: Our revenue from UK & Europe increased by £70.3 million, or 29.1%, to £312.0 million
for the 2018 financial year from £241.7 million for the 2017 financial year. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra.

Australia: Our revenue from Australia increased by £24.1 million, or 27.2%, to £112.8 million for the
2018 financial year from £88.7 million for the 2017 financial year. This increase was primarily due to
organic growth and the full-year impact of the consolidation of Dunlop Flooring, which was acquired
during the prior year.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by £58.6 million, or 26.5%, to £279.4 million for the 2018 financial year from
£220.8 million for the 2017 financial year. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the acquisitions of
Millennium, Keraben and Serra. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased by
1.0 percentage point from 66.8% for the 2017 financial year to 65.8% for the 2018 financial year.

_Gross profit_

Gross profit increased by £35.8 million, or 32.7%, to £145.4 million for the 2018 financial year from
£109.6 million for the 2017 financial year. Our gross profit margin increased by 1.0 percentage point from
33.2% for the 2017 financial year to 34.2% for the 2018 financial year. This improvement was driven in
part by our evolving product mix, reflecting the addition of ceramic flooring products from our acquisitions
of Keraben and Serra, as well as operational improvements including the closure of our Kidderminster
factory.

_Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_

Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £17.1 million, or
80.0%, to £38.6 million for the 2018 financial year from £21.5 million for the 2017 financial year.
Distribution costs increased by £4.5 million, or 8.2%, to £59.4 million for the 2018 financial year from
£54.9 million for the 2017 financial year. These increases were primarily due to the acquisitions of Keraben
and Serra. In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs have, as a percentage of
revenue, remained constant at 23.1% of revenue.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income increased by £0.9 million, or 180.0%, to £1.4 million for the 2018 financial year
from £0.5 million for the 2017 financial year. This income primarily relates to the sale to the local power
grid of electricity generated as a byproduct of the manufacturing process from Keraben’s combined heat
and power plant.

_Underlying operating profit_

Underlying operating profit increased by £15.1 million, or 44.8%, to £48.8 million for the 2018 financial
year from £33.7 million for the 2017 financial year. Our underlying operating profit margin increased by
1.3 percentage points from 10.2% for the 2017 financial year to 11.5% for the 2018 financial year. This
increase is primarily attributable to the increase in our gross profit margin.

79


-----

_Finance costs_

Our underlying finance costs increased by £3.7 million, or 86.0%, to £8.0 million for the 2018 financial year
from £4.3 million for the 2017 financial year. This reflects the increased level of financial debt we have
incurred as our business has grown, with debt (as well as equity) being used to partially fund the
acquisitions of Keraben and Serra during the year, as well as the full-year impact of acquisitions made in
the prior year. Reported net finance costs (after the inclusion of non-underlying items) increased by
£5.1 million, or 64.6%, to £13.0 million for the 2018 financial year from £7.9 million for the 2017 financial
year, with the largest component of non-underlying finance costs being foreign exchange translation losses.

_Taxation_

The reported corporation tax charge decreased by £1.4 million, or 22.6%, to £4.8 million for the 2018
financial year from £6.2 million for the 2017 financial year. The underlying tax charge of £9.2 million for
the 2018 financial year, when measured against underlying profit before tax, represents an effective tax rate
of 22.5%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of £6.4 million for the 2017 financial year and an
effective tax rate of 21.9%. The slight increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects mix effects of
varying tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

_Underlying EBITDA_

Underlying EBITDA increased by £19.0 million, or 41.6%, to £64.7 million for the 2018 financial year from
£45.7 million for the 2017 financial year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Keraben
and Serra. Our Underlying EBITDA margin increased by 1.4 percentage points from 13.8% for the 2017
financial year to 15.2% for the 2018 financial year.

_Revenue_

During the 2017 financial year, our revenue increased by £75.2 million, or 29.5%, to £330.4 million from
£255.2 million for the 2016 financial year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisitions of
Ezi Floor in the UK, GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands, and Dunlop Flooring in Australia, as well as
the full-year impact of the consolidation of Quest Carpets and Interfloor, which were acquired during the
prior year. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions and movements in foreign exchange, and adjusting
for the difference in length of the periods, like-for-like revenue growth in the year was 4.6%. This growth
was primarily driven by increases in sales volumes.

_Revenue by geographical segment_

Australia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58.3 88.7

UK & Europe: Our revenue from UK & Europe increased by £44.8 million, or 22.8%, to £241.7 million
for the 2017 financial year from £197.0 million for the 2016 financial year. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisitions of Ezi Floor, GrassInc and Avalon, as well as the full-year impact of the consolidation of
Interfloor, which was acquired during the prior year.

Australia: Our revenue from Australia increased by £30.4 million, or 52.1% (30.5% in constant currency
terms, to £88.7 million for the 2017 financial year from £58.3 million for the 2016 financial year. This
increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Dunlop Flooring, as well as the full-year impact of the
consolidation of Quest Carpets, which was acquired during the prior year.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by £50.9 million, or 30.0%, to £220.8 million for the 2017 financial year from
£169.9 million for the 2016 financial year. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to the increased size of
the group as a result of acquisitions in the period. Our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue
increased by 0.2 percentage points from 66.6% for the 2016 financial year to 66.8% for the 2017 financial
year.

_Gross profit_

Gross profit increased by £24.3 million, or 28.9%, to £109.6 million for the 2017 financial year from
£85.3 million for the 2016 financial year. Our gross profit margin remained relatively stable at 33.2% for
the 2017 financial year, decreasing by 0.2 percentage points from 33.4% for the 2016 financial year. Gross
profit margin was impacted by a mixture of ongoing operational improvements and acquisition mix effects
between different product segments.

_Underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs_

Administrative expenses (excluding non-underlying and exceptional items) increased by £7.7 million, or
55.8%, to £21.5 million for the 2017 financial year from £13.8 million for the 2016 financial year.

-----

Distribution costs increased by £5.0 million, or 10.0%, to £54.9 million for the 2017 financial year from
£49.9 million for the 2016 financial year. These increases were primarily due to the increased scale of the
business following the acquisitions of Ezi Floor, GrassInc, Avalon and Dunlop Flooring, as well as the
full-year impact of the consolidation of Quest Carpets and Interfloor, which were acquired during the prior
year. In total, underlying administrative expenses and distribution costs have, as a percentage of revenue,
reduced to 23.1% for the 52 weeks ended April 1, 2017 from 25.0% for the 53 weeks ended April 2, 2016.
This improvement was driven by the ongoing delivery of cost synergies and operational efficiency
improvements.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income increased by £0.2 million, or 66.7%, to £0.5 million for the 2017 financial year
from £0.3 million for the 2016 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by income from renting
portions of our properties, sale of excess stock to auction houses and government grants.

_Underlying operating profit_

Underlying operating profit increased by £11.8 million, or 53.9%, to £33.7 million for the 2017 financial
year from £21.9 million for the 2016 financial year. Our underlying profit margin increased by
1.6 percentage points from 8.6% for the 2016 financial year to 10.2% for the 2017 financial year. This
increase was primarily attributable to the reduction in administrative and distribution costs as a percentage
of revenue, driven by the ongoing delivery of cost synergies and operational efficiency improvements.

Finance costs decreased by £0.5 million, or 6.3%, to £7.9 million for the 2017 financial year from
£8.4 million for the 2016 financial year. Our underlying finance costs increased by £0.6 million, or 16.2%,
to £4.3 million for the 2017 financial year from £3.7 million for the 2016 financial year. The increase in
underlying costs was due to the debt used to fund acquisitions in the period.

_Taxation_

The reported corporate tax charge increased by £2.9 million, or 87.9%, to £6.2 million for the 2017
financial year from £3.3 million for the 2016 financial year. The underlying tax charge of £6.4 million for
the 52 weeks ended April 1, 2017, when measured against underlying profit before tax, represents an
effective tax rate of 21.9%. This compares to an underlying tax charge of £4.3 million for the 53 weeks
ended April 2, 2016 and an effective tax rate of 23.6%. The reduction in the effective tax rate primarily
reflects mix effects of varying tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

_Underlying EBITDA_

Underlying EBITDA increased by £13.4 million, or 41.5%, to £45.7 million for the 2017 financial year from
£32.3 million for the 2016 financial year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Ezi Floor,
GrassInc, Avalon and Dunlop Flooring as well as the full-year impact of the consolidation of Quest
Carpets and Interfloor, which were acquired during the prior year. Our Underlying EBITDA margin
increased by 1.1 percentage points from 12.7% for the 2016 financial year to 13.8% for the 2017 financial
year, driven by the ongoing delivery of cost synergies and operational efficiency improvements.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Capital Resources_**

Our primary sources of liquidity for the periods presented have primarily been our loan facility
agreements, cash flows from operations and retained earnings. The principal financing arrangements that
will be in place following the Offering will consist of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the
BGF Loan, as described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ The
proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay the Bridge Facility on the Issue Date and, together with cash
on hand, pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and
_‘‘Capitalization.’’_

Following the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom, our debt service obligations will
consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes, principal and interest payments on amounts drawn
under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, the BGF Loan and any capital lease obligations.

-----

As of June 30, 2018, on a _pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had net_
senior debt on a consolidated basis of £339.3 million.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available
borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations,
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these
needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flow
from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our
projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and the cost of our current and future
debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of
credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing
our debt, and our general financial performance. See ‘‘Risk Factors—We will require a significant amount of
_cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate or raise sufficient cash depends on_
_many factors beyond our control.’’_

**_Cash Flows_**

_Cash flow from operating activities_

Net cash flow generated by operating activities remained stable at £3.3 million for the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 and for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Operating cash flow before interest, tax and
exceptional items increased by £5.5 million to £12.1 million for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from
£6.6 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Operating Cash Flow Conversion as measured against
EBITDA remained broadly consistent, at 51.5% for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 as compared to
55.5% for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. This level of conversion is lower than that achieved during the
2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years due to working capital seasonality.

Net cash flow generated by operating activities increased by £5.3 million to a net inflow of £37.0 million for
the 2018 financial year from a net inflow of £31.7 million for the 2017 financial year. This increase was
primarily due to increases in operating profits as a result of the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra partially
offset by a number of exceptional costs associated with these acquisitions. Operating cash flow before
interest, tax and exceptional items increased by £20.7 million to £64.3 million for the 2018 financial year
from £43.6 million for the 2017 financial year. Operating Cash Flow Conversion as measured against
EBITDA was 95.4% for the 2017 financial year as compared to 99.4% for the 2018 financial year.

Net cash flow generated by operating activities increased by £7.7 million to £31.7 million for the 2017
financial year from £24.0 million for the 2016 financial year. This increase was primarily due to increases in
operating profits as a result of the acquisitions of Ezi Floor, GrassInc, Avalon and Dunlop Flooring
partially offset by a number of exceptional costs associated with these acquisitions. Operating cash flow
before interest, tax and exceptional items increased by £11.4 million, to £43.6 million for the 2017 financial
year from £32.2 million for the 2016 financial year. Operating Cash Flow Conversion as measured against
EBITDA was 99.7% for the 2016 financial year as compared to 95.4% for the 2017 financial year.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by £6.1 million to a net outflow of £12.8 million for the
13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from a net outflow of £6.7 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. The
increase was primarily due to increased levels of capital expenditure reflecting the increased scale of the
business and specific expansionary capital expenditure projects. See ‘‘—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
_Capital Expenditures.’’_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by £259.0 million to a net outflow of £316.3 million for the
2018 financial year from a net outflow of £57.3 million for the 2017 financial year. The increase was
primarily due to the cash consideration paid on completion of the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by £22.3 million to a net outflow of £57.3 million for the 2017
financial year from a net outflow of £35.0 million for the 2016 financial year. This increase was primarily
due to the cash consideration paid on completion for the acquisitions of Ezi Floor, Dunlop Flooring,
Avalon and GrassInc.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

Net cash generated by financing activities decreased by £7.7 million to a net outflow of £6.1 million for the
13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 from a net inflow of £1.6 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. The
decrease was primarily due to utilization of excess cash to pay down long-term loan balances.

Net cash generated by financing activities increased by £273.2 million to £306.6 million for the 2018
financial year from £33.4 million for the 2017 financial year. The increase was primarily due to the increase
in long-term loans related to the acquisitions of Keraben and Serra, which was partially offset by the excess
cash used to pay down balances on our existing indebtedness.

Net cash generated by financing activities decreased by £4.7 million to £33.4 million for the 2017 financial
year from £37.8 million for the 2016 financial year. The decrease reflected the increase in long-term loans
related to the acquisitions of Ezi Floor, Dunlop Flooring, Avalon and GrassInc and the 2016 issue of share
capital by Victoria PLC.

**_Working Capital_**

Our working capital follows a seasonal pattern, and is generally at its highest at the beginning of the
seasonal peak in soft-flooring in September. See ‘‘—Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Seasonality.’’_

As of the end of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years, our trade working capital was £35.1 million,
£45.3 million and £67.0 million, respectively. These increases were due to the acquisitions for the period
and the growth of the business. As at July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018, our trade working capital was
£51.7 million and £90.3 million, respectively.

The following table sets forth the components of our working capital as of the dates indicated.

**As of** **As of**
**April 2,** **April 1,** **March 31,** **July 1,** **June 30,**

**_Capital Expenditures_**

We categorize our capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or expansionary capital
expenditures. As much of our plant and machinery is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a
modular basis, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are minimal. While our maintenance
capital expenditures have increased over the period under review, as our business has grown, our
maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue have remained relatively stable, at
4.0%, 3.3% and 3.3% for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years, respectively. Our expansionary capital

84


-----

expenditures are primarily related to our initiatives to expand and improve our manufacturing and logistics
capabilities in order to meet the needs of our growing business.

Our capital expenditures during the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 were £10.9 million compared to
£4.1 million during the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017. Our capital expenditures during the 13 weeks ended
June 30, 2018 comprised: £4.3 million in maintenance capital expenditures and £6.6 million in
expansionary capital expenditures, consisting of (i) the addition of Keraben’s new clay atomizers in floor
and wall plants in order to increase clay reception capacity, (ii) Keraben’s new inkjet printing machines for
wall and floor pressing and glazing processes and (iii) the renovation of the South Wales factory.

Our capital expenditures during the 2018 financial year were £29.3 million compared to £10.8 million
during the 2017 financial year. The increase in our capital expenditures in the 2018 financial year as
compared to the 2017 financial year was primarily attributable to the increase in our maintenance capital
expenditures due to the growth of our business and to the increase in our expansionary capital
expenditures due to the relocation of our Midlands Distribution Center and the completed opening of our
Southern Distribution Center, the replacement of one of Serra’s production lines to increase production
capacity and the addition of new plant and equipment at certain of Keraben’s production facilities. Our
capital expenditures during the 2018 financial year comprised: £14.1 million in maintenance capital
expenditures and £15.2 million in expansionary capital expenditures.

Our capital expenditures during the 2017 financial year were £10.8 million compared to £10.2 million
during the 2016 financial year. Our capital expenditures remained relatively stable over these periods due
to an increase in our maintenance capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in our expansionary
capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures during the 2017 financial year comprised: £10.8 million in
maintenance capital expenditures and nil in expansionary capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures
during the 2016 financial year comprised of £10.2 million in maintenance capital expenditures. Including
recently acquired businesses, we expect that total capital expenditures for the 2019 financial year will be
in-line with capital expenditures in recent periods.

In the 2019 financial year, we expect our maintenance capital expenditures to increase to between
£15 million and £25 million. The increase in our expected maintenance capital expenditures reflects the
growth in our business since the end of the 2018 financial year. The increase in our expected expansionary
capital expenditures is expected to be primarily attributable to our ongoing logistics optimization projects
as well as investments to increase our manufacturing capacity in our Abingdon, Quest and Keraben
businesses.

exchange rate differs from the exchange rate in effect as of March 31, 2018 and may differ from the exchange rate in effect as of
the Issue Date. You should not view such translations as a representation that such pound sterling amounts actually represent
such euro amounts, or could be or could have been converted into pounds sterling at the rate indicated or at any other rate, on
such date or any other date.

We also have a contingent bank guarantee under the New Revolving Credit Facility equal to £4.4 million in
relation to certain deferred consideration with respect to our acquisition of Serra.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk**

**_Credit Risk_**

Our principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments.

Our exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to our trade receivables. Credit risk is managed locally
by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are obtained
from reputable external sources. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which,
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction on the recoverability of the cash flows.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties
are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

We have no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of
counterparties and customers.

The Issuer has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the
performances of which are closely monitored. Further, the carrying amounts of monies owed by the
Issuer’s subsidiaries are approximate to their fair value.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk arises from our management of working capital and the finance charges and principal
repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its
financial obligations as they fall due. Our policy is to ensure that we always have sufficient cash to allow us
to meet our liabilities when they become due.

To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed
facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days.

The board of directors of the Issuer (the ‘‘Board’’) monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts
against actual cash position on a monthly basis. At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that
the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably
expected circumstances.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, equity capital and bank facilities,
including hire purchase and lease finance. The Group borrows in the desired currency at floating or fixed
rates of interest and may then use interest rate swaps to secure the desired interest profile and manage
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we anticipate that
only the amounts that we borrow under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to variable
interest rates, as the Notes will carry interest at a fixed rate.

The annualized effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the
variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase
in post-tax profit of £1.2 million for the 2018 financial year. A 50 basis point increase in the interest rate
would, on the same basis, have reduced the profit for the year by the same amount.

**_Currency risk_**

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various factors, primarily
with respect to the pound sterling, the euro and the Australian dollar. Our main currency exposure arises
from our ownership of our Continental European and Australian subsidiaries, which accounted for
approximately 62.8% and 9.8% of our total assets in the 2018 financial year. It is the Board’s policy not to
hedge against translational risk-resulting movements in the pound sterling/Australian dollar and pound
sterling/euro exchange rates. Other currency exposure derives from trading operations where goods are
exported or raw materials and capital equipment are imported. These exposures may be managed by
forward currency contracts, particularly when the amounts or periods to maturities are significant and at
times when currencies are particularly volatile. See ‘‘—Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Macroeconomic Factors—Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations.’’_

86


-----

**_Trading risk_**

It is our policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.

**_Price risk_**

We are exposed to price risk in respect of corporate bonds held, which are accounted for within cash and
cash equivalents. The volatility of such securities is very low. If the quoted price for these securities
increased or decreased by 10%, profit before tax and equity would correspondingly change by £0.5 million.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The amounts presented in
our consolidated financial statements involve the use of estimates and assumptions about the future.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
such estimates and judgments could cause actual results to differ and the estimates and assumptions will
seldom equal the related actual results.

Our accounting policies are more fully described in the ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ sections of our
audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We believe
the following policies to be the most significant policies that require management to consider matters that
are inherently uncertain or to make subjective and complex judgments.

**_Measurement of intangible assets_**

Intangible assets are recognized on acquisitions in relation to customer relationships, brands and
developed technology. The fair value of these assets are determined by discounting estimated future net
cash flows generated by the asset where no active market for the assets exists. These are assessed based
upon our forecasts for each business in question. Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates,
growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty rates and customer attrition.

**_Measurement of deferred tax assets_**

We have potential deferred tax assets, principally in the form of tax losses, but deferred tax assets are only
recognized to the extent it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which
the losses and deductions can be utilized. Recognition therefore involves an assessment of the future
performance of the particular legal entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognized. Deferred tax
assets in respect of losses recognized at the balance sheet date are based on the assumption that there is a
high expectation that the asset will be realized in due course.

**_Valuation of deferred and contingent earn-out consideration_**

Liabilities are recognized in respect of acquisitions with outstanding deferred or contingent earn-outs at
the end of the period. These are assessed based upon management forecasts for each relevant business
based upon our financial projections for the next 12 months and by applying growth assumptions for future
years where relevant. Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected
changes to selling prices and direct costs.

**_Share based payments_**

We have share based payment incentive arrangements in place for certain employees. The fair value of
these growth shares is based on the growth in the share price of the Issuer above a certain threshold and is
measured using the appropriate valuation model (Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo) at the grant date. Key
assumptions include expected volatility and the expected exercise period. The growth shares awarded
effectively track the market capitalization of the Issuer and, therefore, historical share price volatility has
been used as a guide to the expected future volatility of the growth shares. As the fair value of the share
based payment charge is spread on a straight line basis to the income statement over the expected term,
this estimate impacts the annual charge recognized.

87


-----

**_Defined benefit obligation_**

We have two defined benefit pension schemes. The obligations under the schemes are recognized in our
consolidated balance sheet and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by independent
actuaries, with input from the Board. These actuarial valuations include assumptions such as discount
rates, return on assets and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from time to time according to
prevailing economic conditions.

Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising under
the scheme in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions. The effects of any change to these assumptions are accounted for in the next financial year as
other comprehensive income. The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefits is clearly
dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgment.

**_Inventories_**

A proportion of inventory is made up of stocks which are not expected to sell for the full normal selling
price, either because they are remnants, come from discontinued ranges, or are below the required quality
standard. This inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. For the 2018 financial year,
the total movement in stock provisions resulted in a credit to the income statement of £0.5 million (2017
financial year: credit of £0.2 million; 2016 financial year: charge of £0.2 million).

**_Trade receivables_**

Amounts owed by subsidiaries to the Issuer are not considered to be impaired. The main factors in
assessing the impairment of trade receivables are the age of the balance and the circumstances of the
individual customer. The Board considers that the carrying amount of all receivables, including those
impaired, approximates to their fair value.

**_New Standards and Interpretations_**

_IFRS 9—Financial Instruments_

In 2014, the IASB introduced IFRS 9—Financial Instruments. This standard replaces IAS 39—Financial
_Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. We have implemented IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2018._
IFRS 9 has not been implemented with respect to the 2018 Group Financial Statements but has been
implemented with respect to the Unaudited Group Interim Financial Statements.

We do not anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 will significantly impact the classification and
measurement of our financial instruments. See the ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ section of our 2018
Group Financial Statements for more details about IFRS 9 and our assessment of its impact.

_IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers_

In 2014, the IASB introduced IFRS15—Revenue from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 specifies how and
when revenue is recognized together with enhanced disclosure requirements. IFRS 15 replaces existing
revenue recognition standards: IAS 11—Construction Contracts and IAS 18—Revenue, and a number of
revenue-related interpretations. We have implemented IFRS 15 with effect from January 1, 2018. IFRS 15
has not been implemented with respect to the 2018 Group Financial Statements but has been implemented
with respect to the Unaudited Group Interim Financial Statements.

We do not anticipate that IFRS 15 will significantly impact on our consolidated financial statements. See
the ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ section of our 2018 Group Financial Statements for more details
about IFRS 15 and our assessment of its impact.

IFRS 16—Leases

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16—Leases, which requires most leases to be recognized
on-balance for lessees, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16
replaces IAS 17—Leases and related interpretations. We will implement IFRS 16 with effect from January 1,
2019.

88


-----

We are in the process of evaluating the impact of IFRS 16 on our current lease arrangements. See the
‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ section of our 2018 Group Financial Statements for more details about
IFRS 16 and our assessment of its impact.

**_Impairment of goodwill, investments or intercompany balances_**

Determining whether goodwill, investments or intercompany balances are impaired requires an estimation
of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which value has been allocated. The value in use
calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating
unit and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. We are required on an annual
basis to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill, investments or
intercompany balances are less than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation
of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. None of the goodwill is
expected to be tax deductible.

**KERABEN MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**
**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial_
_Information’’ and ‘‘Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Historical_
_financial information and other data of Keraben’’ as well as with the audited financial statements and the_
_related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The following discussion includes_
_forward-looking statements which, although based on assumptions and/or estimates that Keraben considers_
_reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ_
_materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of those_
_risks and uncertainties, please refer to the sections entitled ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors.’’_

**Overview**

Keraben is a Spanish manufacturer of ceramic tiles for use primarily in residential applications. Based in
the province of Castell´on, in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain, Keraben is one of Spain’s largest
ceramic tile manufacturers by volume, exporting much of its product throughout Continental Europe. On
November 16, 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Keraben for a purchase price of
A274.1 million. Through this acquisition, the Group has established a significant presence within the
attractive ceramic tile flooring segment in Continental Europe.

Keraben manufactures wall and floor tiles targeting the mid- and upper-market segments of the ceramic
flooring market. Keraben possesses a broad portfolio of brands aimed at different product segments,
markets and consumers. Keraben sells its products domestically and internationally, with its primary export
markets being the United Kingdom and other countries in Continental Europe. Keraben’s largest
end-markets by geography are Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Keraben generates the
majority of its revenues from direct sales to retailers who sell the Keraben, Metropol and Casainfinita
brands. Sales to DIY segment retailers make up a smaller proportion of Keraben’s revenues, while sales to
traders make up the smallest proportion of its revenues, mainly serving as a capacity management tool to
maintain production levels. Keraben generated A129.7 million of revenue and A42.9 million of Adjusted
EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, excluding other gains or
losses) for the year ended December 31, 2017.

**Significant Factors Affecting Keraben’s Results of Operations**

Keraben’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity have been influenced in the periods
discussed in this Offering Memorandum by the following events, facts, developments and market
characteristics. Keraben’s management believes that these factors are likely to continue to influence its
operations in the future.

**_Production and Personnel Cost Base_**

Raw materials consumption constitutes the majority of Keraben’s production costs. Keraben’s key raw
material inputs are non-atomized clay, ceramic glazes and natural gas. Keraben purchases non-atomized
clay from different suppliers and conducts the atomization process in-house. Atomized clay consumption
cost per square meter (‘‘m[2]’’) of tile manufactured has remained stable through the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 at approximately A0.92 per m[2]. The consumption cost of ceramic glaze
and related additives, used to finish and add color or other features to tile surface, decreased in the same
period from A0.61 per m[2] per tile manufactured in 2015 to A0.53 per m[2] per tile manufactured in 2017. This
decrease was due to Keraben’s SKU reduction during the period, changes to the production process
resulting in increased consumption efficiency and a general increase in competition in the glazing and
pigments industry. The consumption cost of other raw materials, such as packaging components and other
production consumables remained stable through the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Total raw material expenditures remained relatively stable over the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016
and 2017, at A22.9 million, A25.1 million and A27.1 million, respectively.

Natural gas is Keraben’s largest raw material expenditure. Natural gas is used during production to heat
the kilns in which the clay is fired. Additionally, Keraben uses natural gas to atomize the clay and this
process generates electricity, which is consumed internally, with the excess sold to the local electrical grid.
Natural gas expenditures decreased from A12.0 million in 2015 to A10.3 million in 2017. This decrease was
due to a decrease in natural gas prices caused by a decrease in the Brent price, which was used as a
reference for a portion of Keraben’s natural gas supply under its agreement with British Petroleum

90


-----

between the years of 2015 and 2017 and under its agreement with Galp in 2018. Additionally, efficiency of
gas consumption increased as a result of prior capital investment in production capability. Notwithstanding
higher consumption efficiency, overall gas consumption increased during the same period due to increased
production. Keraben changes its natural gas supplier periodically based on the pricing and terms offered by
each supplier. Keraben has worked with its current gas supplier for many years, but with periodic
interruptions with other suppliers. Keraben’s management also utilizes contracts with suppliers that fix the
price along the term of the contract to hedge against future increases in natural gas prices.

Personnel wages and salaries are another significant cost component, including production personnel and
other departments directly related to the tile production process (maintenance, technical and development
personnel). In 2016, Keraben decided to hire additional production personnel to create a third production
shift in order to decrease expected future overtime wage expenditures. The utilization of a third
production shift has resulted in an increase in productive capacity as well a higher level of efficiency since
production lines now operate continuously.

**_Consumer Preference and Demand_**

Consumers choose to purchase Keraben’s products based on their decision to build new residential and
non-residential buildings and/or decorate and renovate existing structures.

Residential buildings encompass single-family homes, multi-family structures and manufactured housing.
This end-market can be further classified as either new construction or I&R, with I&R constituting the
majority of demand. New residential construction flooring demand follows the growth in new building
construction, while I&R is directly linked to personal income levels. The non-residential end-market
consists of office, retail, institutional, industrial and other business or government facilities. Flooring in this
end-market can also be classified as either new construction or I&R, with the latter representing around
three-quarters of demand. In particular, businesses with heavy decorative flooring needs (for example,
hotels and other hospitality facilities) drive growth in the I&R sub-segment.

Consumers typically base their decision to purchase Keraben’s products on a broad range of preferences,
including color, design, texture, shape, dimensions, pile height and density, price and other structural and
technical features. The countries in which Keraben sells flooring have different consumer preferences,
demands and trends, primarily as a result of diverse cultural histories, climate, lifestyles and economic
conditions. Keraben seeks to design its flooring products to appeal to such end consumer tastes at specific
price points.

**_Business Relationships and Customer Success_**

Keraben operates a business-to-business sales model and therefore does not access the end-consumer
directly. Therefore Keraben relies on its customers’ ability to sell and market its products effectively in
order to increase its revenue and generate sustainable cash flows given, as its customers grow, they tend
also to increase their orders. Keraben thus maintains strong relationships with its customers and works
side-by-side with them to help increase store traffic and grow their business. The quality of the relationship
between Keraben and its customers is important to retain and grow its business. Although design, quality
and price are key factors, other factors influence Keraben’s relationship with its customers, such as
performance track record, including product innovation, on-time delivery and operational efficiency.

**_Acquisitions and disposals_**

In 2016, Keraben sold its shareholdings in certain of its subsidiaries, including, amongst others,
Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A., for total consideration of A35.5 million, some of
which was deferred until March 2017. As a result of these disposals, Keraben’s revenue, impairment
charges, gains/losses on financial instruments, finance income, other gains and losses (dividends),
corporation tax and cash flow from investing activities were impacted during these periods. In 2017,
Keraben sold, at a loss, the entire share capital of its subsidiary Expocer´amica S.A. for total consideration
of A0.3 million.

In 2016, Keraben sold a facility located in Villafames, Castell´on. In 2017, Keraben sold, at a loss of
A0.2 million, a facility located in Alcora, Castell´on, and a clay atomizer´s mill machine for total
consideration of A2.4 million. These assets were not related to Keraben’s core business. The sale of these
assets resulted in an increase in Keraben’s impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2017.

91


-----

In November 2017, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Keraben for total consideration of
A274.1 million. This transaction had an impact on Keraben’s finance income, other gains and losses and
corporation tax during the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Macroeconomic Factors_**

_General Economic Conditions and Industry Environment_

Keraben’s results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, as well as the conditions
affecting consumer spending on ceramic flooring in the markets in which it operates. Such conditions
include levels of employment, consumer confidence, inflation, growth in gross domestic product, real
disposable income, currency exchange and interest rates, home prices, housing market fluctuations and the
availability of consumer credit. All of the markets in which Keraben operates were adversely impacted by
the global economic downturn that started in 2008. Likewise, as macroeconomic indicators like GDP, real
wages and employment levels have improved across Continental Europe and the United Kingdom,
Keraben has seen a return to stable growth in the ceramic flooring market.

Overall economic conditions typically have a direct impact on the specific markets that drive Keraben’s
business, although market sensitivity varies, depending on the product, with products in the upper-market
range typically being more affected. Nevertheless, Keraben’s business is generally less susceptible to
changes in the macroeconomic environment given its stable base of customers in mature, consolidated
markets. During an economic downturn, raw material prices typically decrease, which can mitigate the
adverse effect of potential volume decreases.

**_Seasonality_**

Keraben experiences both purchase and sales seasonality during the summer and winter holiday seasons.
Production and purchases are slow in August and December. The Easter holidays also impact demand to a
lesser degree, depending on the month of the year in which the holidays fall.

**Description of Key Components of Keraben’s Income Statement**

_Revenue_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, Keraben’s revenue increased by A11.7 million, or
9.9%, to A129.7 million from A118.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes, particularly in the domestic Spanish market, while sale
prices remained stable. The increase in sales volume in Spain was driven by the market recovery in Spain,
in particular in the I&R end-market.

_Procurements_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, procurement expenses remained relatively stable,
decreasing by A0.1 million, or 0.3%, to A30.7 million from A30.8 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2016. Keraben’s procurement expenses remained relatively stable over this period due to a
decrease in raw material purchases and a slight decrease in raw material prices, which were partially offset
by an increase of raw materials consumption due to increased production.

_Staff costs_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, staff costs increased by A2.3 million, or 9.7%, to
A26.1 million from A23.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in the average employee headcount. The increase in staff head count was due
to the hiring of new personnel in production and logistics and was particularly driven by the opening of a
new kiln in mid-year 2016.

94


-----

_Other operating costs_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, other operating costs decreased by A0.2 million, or
0.6%, to A31.0 million from A31.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease
was primarily due to a slight decrease in costs relating to external services and expenses for greenhouse gas
emissions as well as a slight decrease in bad debt provisions and local taxes.

_Depreciation and amortization charge_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization charges remained
relatively stable, increasing by A0.1 million, or 1.1%, to A9.0 million from A8.9 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2016, reflecting similar levels of investment in both periods.

_Impairment and gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, impairment losses on disposals of non-current assets
increased by A0.1 million, or 12.5%, to A0.9 million from A0.8 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the disposal of several non-current assets in
Castell´on.

_Other gains or losses_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, other gains or losses was A64.7 million as compared to
A4.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to certain
non-recurring expenses linked to the disposals of Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A.
as well as the non-current assets in Castell´on, which consisted principally of expenses relating to
independent professional advisors, financial expenses relating to the cancellation of existing financing
arrangements and financial expenses in relation to certain management incentive plans triggered by the
acquisition of Keraben by the Group.

_Finance income_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, finance income decreased by A6.0 million, or 95.2%,
to A0.3 million from A6.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease reflects the
payment of dividends by Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A. to Keraben prior to
their sale in 2016, which were reflected in the finance income of Keraben.

_Finance costs_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, finance costs increased by A1.8 million, or 69.2%, to
A4.4 million from A2.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily
due to the incurrence of early repayment fees in connection with the repayment in November 2017 of a
syndicated loan which was formalized in March 2017.

_Impairment and gains or losses on disposals of financial instruments_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, impairment and gains or losses on disposals of
financial instruments decreased by A28.4 million, or 103.3%, to a loss of (A0.9 million) from a gain of
A27.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease reflects the loss of A0.9 million
realized from the sale of Expocer´amica, S.A. and Keraben’s joint venture interest in the Keraben Ceramic
Tabriz in 2017, as compared to the gain of A27.5 million realized in 2016 primarily from the sale of
Keraben’s shares in, amongst others, Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A.

_Corporation tax_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2017, corporation tax expense increased by A2.4 million, or
55.8%, to A6.7 million from A4.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was
primarily due to the increase in non-deductible expenses and a decrease in non-taxable income.

(1) Reflects the restatement of certain comparative information for the financial year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the
entry into force of Royal Decree 602 of December 2, 2016. For additional information on the accounting change and
restatement, see note 2-e to the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Revenue_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, Keraben’s revenue increased by A10.8 million, or
10.1%, to A118.0 million from A107.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase
was primarily due to the market recovery in Spain, in particular in the I&R end-market. This recovery led
to an increase in demand for mid- to upper-market products, including newly launched products.

_Procurements_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, procurement expenses increased by A2.1 million, or
7.3%, to A30.8 million from A28.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in sales, which drove increased consumption of raw materials. The cost of
raw materials remained relatively stable between these periods.

_Staff costs_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, staff costs increased by A1.7 million, or 7.7%, to
A23.8 million from A22.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was
primarily due to the introduction of a third production shift, which led to an increase in employee
headcount, some of whom were hired through temporary employment agencies. Staff hired through
temporary employment agencies are more expensive than our own employees.

-----

_Other operating expenses_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, other operating expenses increased by A0.2 million, or
0.6%, to A31.2 million from A31.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase
was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt provisions.

_Depreciation and amortization charge_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization charges increased by
A0.5 million, or 6.0%, to A8.9 million from A8.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015.
The increase was primarily due to the investments made in plant and equipment.

_Impairment and gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, impairment losses on disposals of non-current assets
decreased by A10.6 million, or 93.0%, to A0.8 million from A11.4 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of Keraben’s non-current assets in
Castell´on, which were sold in 2016.

_Other gains or losses_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, other gains or losses was a loss of A4.1 million as
compared to a gain of A0.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was
primarily due to the extraordinary 2016 compensation paid by Keraben to its management board following
the sale of Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A. pursuant to Keraben’s acquisition
valuation-related sale incentive plan for managers.

_Finance income_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, finance income increased by A4.9 million, or 350.0%,
to A6.3 million from A1.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was
primarily due to the receipt of dividends in 2016 from Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos
Cer´amicos, S.A.

_Finance costs_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, finance costs decreased by A0.2 million, or 7.1%, to
A2.6 million from A2.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily
due to the partial write-off of an existing guarantee issued by Keraben to a group company.

_Impairment and gains or losses on disposals of financial instruments_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, impairment and gains or losses on disposals of
financial instruments was a gain of A27.5 million as compared to a loss of A0.7 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the gain of A27.5 million realized in 2016
from the sale of Keraben’s shares in Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A.

_Corporation tax_

During the financial year ended December 31, 2016, corporation tax expense increased by A3.3 million, or
330.0%, to A4.3 million from A1.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2015. The increase
was primarily due to the increase in profit from operations.

restatement, see note 2-e to the 2016 Keraben Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

Net cash flow generated by operating activities decreased by A62.7 million to a net outflow of A26.0 million
for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 from a net inflow of A36.7 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to certain non-recurring expenses linked to the
disposals of certain subsidiaries, including, amongst others, Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos
Cer´amicos, S.A. as well as the non-current assets in Castell´on. These non-recurring expenses were paid in
cash.

Net cash flow generated by operating activities increased by A23.7 million to a net inflow of A36.7 million
for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 from a net inflow of A13.0 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in sales revenue and the increase
in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2015, as a result of an increase in the payment period for suppliers.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Net cash flow from investing activities decreased by A34.2 million to a net outflow of A3.6 million for the
financial year ended December 31, 2017 from a net inflow of A30.6 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the disposals of certain subsidiaries, including,
amongst others, Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A.

Net cash flow from investing activities increased by A38.5 million to a net inflow of A30.6 million for the
financial year ended December 31, 2016 from a net outflow of A7.9 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the extraordinary cash inflow from the disposals of
certain subsidiaries, including, amongst others, Construplas, S.L. and Nuevos Productos Cer´amicos, S.A.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

Net cash from financing activities increased by A76.6 million to a net inflow of A20.1 million for the
financial year ended December 31, 2017 from a net outflow of A56.5 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the new intragroup debt with Victoria PLC in 2017.

Net cash generated by financing activities decreased by A51.0 million to a net outflow of A56.5 million for
the financial year ended December 31, 2016 from a net outflow of A5.5 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2015. The decrease primarily reflected the payment of dividends to the management board
of Keraben in 2016.

**_Working Capital_**

Sales have historically been slightly higher in September, October and November, reflecting consumer
trends of undertaking indoor improvements in preparation for winter. Keraben intentionally builds up
inventories during the months of June and July in preparation for the fall increase in demand and the
annual shutdown for maintenance and repair of the majority of Keraben’s manufacturing facilities in

-----

August. As a result, Keraben’s trade working capital is higher during the summer months compared to the
rest of the year.

As of the end of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, Keraben’s trade working capital was
A29.6 million, A24.1 million and A25.3 million, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of Keraben’s
revenue, Keraben’s trade working capital ratio was 27.6%, 20.4% and 19.5% in the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

The following table sets forth the components of Keraben’s working capital for each of the periods
indicated:

(2) Customers includes trade & other receivables less current tax assets and other accounts receivable from public authorities.

(3) Suppliers includes trade and other payables less other accounts payable to public authorities.

(4) Stock includes inventories.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Keraben’s capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were A10.2 million,
A8.6 million and A6.8 million, respectively. Keraben has planned growth capital expenditures over the
2016-2022 financial year period in order to increase its maximum production capacity and to adapt
production lines to new tiles and product mixes. Investments to increase production capacity include
(i) development of a new production plant expected to begin production in 2020, (ii) new clay atomizers in
floor and wall plants in order to increase clay reception capacity, and (iii) new inkjet printing machines for
wall and floor pressing and glazing processes. Keraben also intends to invest in certain product
mix-changes, which include investments in presses and glazing to adapt production lines to newer, largeformat production.

**Financial Indebtedness**

**_Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities_**

On November 16, 2017, in connection with its acquisition by Victoria, Keraben amortized and entirely
repaid and cancelled all outstanding amounts under all of its contractual and contingent liabilities with
financial institutions. On November 16, 2017, Keraben, as borrower, entered into an intercompany loan
agreement with Victoria PLC in the aggregate principal amount of A89.8 million.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk**

**_Credit Risk_**

Keraben keeps its cash and equivalent liquid assets with reputable financial institutions. In addition, a
significant proportion of its turnover and accounts receivable from non-related clients are guaranteed by
means of credit insurance policies.

Furthermore, Keraben is not exposed to significant concentrated third-party credit risk, since no client
represents more than 10% of Keraben’s total accounts receivable as of March 31, 2018. Individual credit
limits are established on the basis of both internal and external ratings, in accordance with the limits set by
Keraben. The use of these credit limits is regularly monitored.

99


-----

**_Liquidity Risk_**

In order to ensure liquidity and in order to meet payment obligations resulting from its business activities,
Keraben disposes treasury by the amount shown in the balance sheet, as well as the financing supplied by
the ultimate parent company from the group in which it is integrated. Consequently, Keraben’s directors
believe that the company has sufficient financial resources to engage in its normal business activities.

**_Market risk (including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price-related risk)_**

Keraben’s cash and financial debt are exposed to interest rate risk, which could have a significant effect on
its financial results and cash flow, in the case a significant variation of such interest rate takes place.
Keraben’s formalized debt with Victoria PLC for an amount of A89.8 million has a fixed interest rate
(2.75%) and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk.

Exchange rate risk is mainly concentrated in the sale of finished products to countries in America and
Asia, which are priced in US dollars. Keraben maintains specific and adequate policies to monitor and
manage exchange rate risk in the different currencies in which it transacts.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

**_Intangible fixed assets_**

As a general rule, intangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost of acquisition or production cost.
Subsequently, they are valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where
applicable, minus losses incurred as a result of impairment. These assets are depreciated on the basis of
their useful life.

**_Tangible fixed assets and real estate investments_**

Tangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost of acquisition or production cost, and subsequently
valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, minus losses
incurred as a result of impairment. The cost of replacing or refurbishing complete items and the cost of
extending, modernizing or improving items in order to extend their useful life, productivity or economic
yield are entered as a higher cost of the tangible fixed asset in question, with the corresponding removal of
the replaced or refurbished items. Regular maintenance, conservation and repair costs are entered against
the results, using the accrual principle, as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

**_Value impairment of intangible fixed assets, tangible fixed assets and real estate investments_**

At the end of each financial year, whenever there are signs of a fall in value, Keraben uses an impairment
test to estimate the possible existence of a fall in value that may reduce the recoverable value of such assets
to an amount that is lower than their book value. The recoverable value is calculated as either the fair
value minus sale costs or the operational value, whichever is higher. In the event that the asset does not in
itself generate cash flows independently from other assets, Keraben calculates the recoverable value of the
cash flow-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

**_Leases_**

Leases are classified as financial leases whenever it can be concluded from the terms and conditions of the
leases that the risks and benefits inherent in ownership of the asset forming the subject of the agreement
are transferred substantially to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operational leases. In the
financial leasing transactions in which Keraben acts as lessee, the cost of the leased assets is entered in the
balance sheet on the basis of the nature of the item forming the subject of the agreement, and a liability in
the same amount is simultaneously entered. Any costs resulting from operational lease agreements are
entered in the profit and loss account in the financial year in which they are incurred.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets are initially entered, in general terms, at the fair value of the consideration handed over in
payment plus any costs that can be directly attributed to the transaction. Loans and accounts receivable are
subsequently valued at their depreciated cost. Keraben carries out an impairment test, at least at the end of
each financial year, on any financial assets that are not entered at their reasonable value. It is considered
that there is objective evidence of impairment if the recoverable value of the financial asset is lower than

100


-----

its book value. When such impairment occurs, this is entered in the profit and loss account. In particular,
as regards value adjustments relating to commercial debtors and other accounts receivable, the rule used
by Keraben to calculate the relevant value adjustments is to classify the amounts owing as doubtful debts.

Debts and accounts payable are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration received, adjusted to
take account of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are valued according
to their depreciated cost. Keraben removes financial liabilities when the obligations that gave rise to them
disappear.

A Net Equity Instrument represents a residual shareholding in the equity of a company once all its
liabilities have been deducted. The Net Equity Instruments emitted by Keraben are registered in the net
equity by the amount received, net from expenses linked to its emission.

**_Stocks_**

Stocks are valued at their acquisition price, production price or net realizable value, whichever is the
lowest. Commercial discounts, lower prices obtained, other similar amounts and the interest included in
the base number of debited items are deducted when calculating the acquisition price. Discounts for
prompt payment are also included as a lower purchase price, whether shown in the invoice or not.

Production cost includes direct material costs and, where applicable, direct labor costs and general
manufacturing costs. The net realizable value represents an estimate of the sale price minus all the costs
that are estimated in order to complete manufacture, plus any costs that will be incurred during the course
of the marketing, sales and distribution processes. When allocating value to its inventories, Keraben uses
the first in first-out (FIFO) method. Keraben makes the appropriate value adjustments, entering them as a
cost in the profit and loss account, when the net realizable value of stocks is lower than their cost of
acquisition (or production cost).

**_Subsidies, donations and bequests received_**

Non-repayable subsidies, donations and bequests are valued at the fair value of the amount granted or
item received, depending on whether or not it is in monetary form, and they are entered in the results in
proportion to the amount allocated to depreciation of the item benefiting from the subsidy over the period
or, where applicable, when it is disposed of or a value adjustment is made for its impairment, with the
exception of amounts received from members or owners, which are entered directly as shareholder equity
and do not constitute any kind of income. Repayable subsidies are entered as liabilities while they remain
repayable.

**_Transactions in foreign currency_**

The operational currency used by Keraben is the euro. Consequently, all transactions in currencies other
than the euro are regarded as being denominated in foreign currency and entered according to the rates of
exchange that apply on the transaction date. At the end of the financial year, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are converted at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet.
Any profit or loss that emerges is entered directly in the profit and loss account for the financial year in
which it occurs.

**_Tax on profits_**

The cost or income from tax on profits or losses comprises the (i) to the cost or income from current tax
and (ii) the cost or income due to deferred tax. Current tax is the amount that Keraben pays as a
consequence of the tax payable on the income it has earned during the financial year. Any deductions or
other tax advantages that apply to the tax amount, excluding withheld taxes and payments on account, plus
any tax losses that can be offset from previous financial years and that can be applied during the current
year, lead to a decrease in the current tax amount. The cost or income from deferred tax corresponds to
the recognition and cancellation of assets and liabilities resulting from deferred taxes. These include the
time-period differences identified as amounts that are expected to be payable or recoverable due to the
difference between the asset and liability amounts shown in the books and their taxable value, together
with any negative tax bases that are pending offset and credits due as the result of deductions against tax
that are not fiscally applied. These amounts are entered by applying the time-period difference or
corresponding credit to the tax rate at which they are expected to be recovered or paid.

101


-----

**_Income and expenses_**

Income and expenses are entered on the basis of accrual criteria, that is at the time of the actual flow of
goods and services that they represent, regardless of the time at which the monetary or financial flow
resulting from such goods and services occurs. Income is valued at the fair value of the payment received
minus discounts and taxes. Income from sales is entered at the moment that all significant risk and benefit
inherent in ownership of the item being sold is transferred to the purchaser, and neither current
management of that item nor effective control thereover are subsequently maintained. With regards to
income from the provision of services, this is recognized on the basis of the degree to which such services
have been completed on the date of the balance sheet, provided that the results of the transaction can be
reliably estimated. Interests received from financial assets are entered on the basis of the effective interest
rate method, while dividends are entered when the shareholders’ right to receive them is announced. In
any case, any interest or dividends accruing on financial assets subsequent to their acquisition are entered
as income in the profit and loss account.

**_Provisions and contingencies_**

Provisions are valued at the current value of the best possible estimate of the amount that will be required
to cancel or transfer the obligation, bearing in mind all available information relating to the event and its
consequences, and any adjustments arising as a result of the updating of such provisions are entered as a
financial cost as they accrue. Contingent liabilities are not entered in the annual accounts, though
information on such liabilities is given insofar as they are not classified as remote.

**_Assets items of an environmental nature and greenhouse gas emission rights_**

Asset items of an environmental nature are understood to be lasting assets that are used during the course
of Keraben’s activities for the main purpose of minimizing environmental impact, protecting and
improving the environment, including the reduction or elimination of future contamination.

The tangible fixed asset items designed to minimize any environmental impact that could result from the
activities engaged in by Keraben are valued at cost price, adjusted by their accumulated depreciation. Any
extension, modernization and improvement costs are capitalized when they represent an extension of the
estimated useful life of the assets in question. Otherwise they are treated as costs for that financial year,
along with repair and maintenance costs. Any costs that are incurred in relation to the protection and
improvement of the environment and that do not represent an investment in tangible fixed assets are
entered in the results for the year in which they are incurred, regardless of the time at which the cash or
financial stream resulting from such costs materializes. Amounts incurred in the management of
environmental effects resulting from the business activities engaged in by Keraben are classified as
environmental costs, as are the costs that result from Keraben’s existing environmental undertakings.
These include the costs incurred as a result of preventing pollution in relation to Keraben’s current
operational activities, the treatment of residue and waste, decontamination, restoration, environmental
management and environmental auditing.

Greenhouse gas emission rights, which are used for the cancellation of the obligation derived from the
emissions developed by Keraben, were reclassified as stocks. In the same way, emission rights hold to be
sold were registered. Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of a right is calculated as
the difference between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and
loss account. ‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ are entered in the balance sheet when Keraben becomes
eligible for such rights. When such rights are acquired free of charge or at a price that is substantially lower
than their market value, the acquisition price is considered to be their market price at the time of
acquisition or at the beginning of the calendar year. In this case, they will be entered with a contra entry
under ‘‘Subsidies, donations and bequests received’’ in the Net Equity Value section of the balance sheet,
once any deferred tax associated with them has been deducted.

After being entered as an asset, emission rights are valued at their acquisition price or production price
under stocks. The necessary provisions are set aside in order to give them their lower market value at the
end of each financial year, whenever their book value may not be recoverable from the generation of
sufficient income to cover all costs and expenses. Costs attached to the emission of greenhouse gases
require the corresponding provision to be made for risks and costs, and this provision is maintained until
the moment that Keraben has to cancel the obligation in question by handing over the corresponding
emission rights.

102


-----

**_Related party transactions_**

Keraben carries out all related party transactions at market prices. In addition, its transfer pricing policy is
properly supported on the basis of the requirements set out in current tax legislation. Keraben’s board of
directors therefore believe that there are no material risks associated with related party transaction that
could give rise to company liabilities.

**_Classification of current and non-current balances_**

Current assets are understood to be assets that are linked to the normal business cycle, which is generally
regarded as a one-year period, and the term is also understood to apply to assets that are due to mature or
be disposed of or realized in the short term following the end of the financial year, financial assets
maintained for negotiation and cash and other equivalent liquid assets. Assets that do not meet these
requirements are classified as non-current. Similarly, current liabilities are liabilities that are linked to the
normal business cycle, financial liabilities maintained for negotiation (excluding financial derivatives with a
settlement term of more than one year) and, in general, all obligations that are due to mature or be
cancelled in the short-term, otherwise they are classified as non-current.

**Global Market Overview**

There are a number of products that comprise the global flooring industry. The two major product
segments are: hard-flooring, which is composed of non-resilient flooring and resilient flooring, and
soft-flooring, which is also known as carpets and rugs. Global demand for flooring includes both
hard-flooring and soft-flooring (collectively, ‘‘Global Flooring Demand’’).

Non-resilient flooring includes ceramic tiles, laminate and wood flooring, as well as other miscellaneous
items such as bamboo, glass, plastic and grating. Relative to other flooring products, non-resilient flooring
benefits from durability and ease of maintenance. In 2015, non-resilient flooring accounted for
approximately 61.6% of flooring demand (Source: Freedonia Report). It is forecast that non-resilient
flooring will be the fastest-growing segment of the flooring market from 2015 to 2020, with an expected
compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) of approximately 3.5% (Source: Freedonia Report).

Resilient flooring products mainly consist of vinyl but also include asphalt, cork, linoleum and rubber.
Resilient flooring products are relatively lower in cost compared to other flooring products and benefit
from high underfoot comfort, noise absorption, durability and wear resistance. Also included in this
category are LVT, which have been gaining popularity in recent years with demand expected to continue to
increase. Resilient flooring demand is forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.0% in the period
from 2015 to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

Soft-flooring products are textile floor coverings. These products range from braided, hooked and needlepunched products, as well as tufted products such as broadloom carpeting, scatter rugs, bath mats and
artificial grass. In contrast to the other types of flooring, soft-flooring is expected to show more modest
growth over the 2015 to 2020 period, with a forecast CAGR of approximately 2.4% (Source: Freedonia
Report). Tufted products constitute the vast majority of this segment, and their lower cost and improving
product performance are expected to contribute to demand growth for tufted products.

The level of economic growth has an impact on Global Flooring Demand. Global real gross domestic
product (‘‘GDP’’) is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.5% from 2015 through to 2020, with
the Asia/Pacific region expected to experience the highest growth rate over the forecast period
(Source: Freedonia Report). The forecasted global real GDP growth rate is slightly higher than the global

Global Flooring Demand is forecasted to reach approximately 18.7 billion square meters (‘‘m[2]’’) with a
valuation of approximately $295 billion by 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report). This represents a CAGR of
approximately 3.2% from 2015 to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report). The Asia/Pacific region and the
Africa/Mideast region are projected to contribute to most of this growth, as personal income for
individuals in developing countries in these regions is expected to grow. Growing personal income in these
areas is also expected to translate into increased demand for flooring products as an alternative to
traditional unimproved floor surfaces.

Our largest markets are Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Western European
region is projected to record a CAGR of approximately 1.2% over the 2015 to 2020 period
(Source: Freedonia Report). The United Kingdom is expected to have a similar growth profile over the
same period, with demand also forecasted to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.2% (Source: Freedonia
Report). Demand in Australia, where soft-flooring dominates the market, is forecasted to grow at a CAGR
of approximately 1.1% over the 2015 to 2020 period (Source: Freedonia Report).

Flooring has three predominant end-markets: (i) residential buildings, (ii) non-residential buildings and
(iii) transportation equipment and other uses.

The residential buildings end-market encompasses single-family homes, multi-family structures (for
example, apartments) and manufactured housing. This end-market can be further segmented into (i) new
construction (i.e. the building of new structures) end-market and (ii) improvement and repair (‘‘I&R’’)
end-market. The I&R end-market constitutes the majority of the market.

The non-residential buildings end-market includes office, retail, institutional, industrial, and other
business / government facilities. Like the residential buildings end-market, flooring in this end-market can
also be further segmented into new construction and I&R. The new construction end-market is smaller
relative to the I&R end-market, both globally and in Western Europe.

The transportation equipment and other uses end-market consists of a variety of vehicle types (for
example, automobiles and boats) and other miscellaneous applications such as power plant control rooms
and water treatment facilities. Nearly all of the transportation related flooring products are installed at the
OEM level an remain throughout the vehicle’s life, unless it is refurbished.

105


-----

The primary driver of Global Flooring Demand is construction activity. Construction activity varies from
new construction to I&R. Economic and demographic factors have an impact on the level of construction
activity. For example, residential construction expenditure is influenced by real interest rates, population
growth, employment rates and personal income. On the other hand, non-residential construction
expenditure is impacted by the general business cycle and the supply of buildings within a particular area.
Additionally, higher income countries (such as Australia, the United States and Japan) typically have
well-developed building construction and/or transportation equipment manufacturing sectors, making new
construction and renovations more affordable for their respective populations.

**Global Flooring Demand by Product**

Flooring product demand varies greatly across jurisdictions with flooring decisions influenced by a number
of factors. Cultural preferences are one factor that influence flooring demand. For example, soft-flooring
accounted for the majority (approximately 58%) of flooring demand in the United States in 2015
(Source: Freedonia Report). In contrast, soft-flooring accounted for approximately 8.0% in China in 2015
(Source: Freedonia Report). Additionally, climate can impact flooring choices across geographies, with
ceramic flooring being more popular in warmer regions.

In 2015, non-resilient flooring was the most popular flooring product accounting for approximately 61.6%
of flooring demand (Source: Freedonia Report). Non-resilient flooring is forecast to grow at the fastest
rate between 2015 to 2020 at a CAGR of approximately 3.5% (Source: Freedonia Report). In contrast,
soft-flooring is expected to grow at a more modest pace over this period at a CAGR of approximately 2.4%
(Source: Freedonia Report). The following chart shows Global Flooring Demand by product for 2010 and
2015 as well as forecasted demand for 2020.

Non-resilient flooring tends to be more costly than other flooring products, though this price differential
has decreased as the prices of other products have increased. As the non-resilient flooring segment
encompasses a very broad range of products, it is more fragmented than the flooring industry as a whole.

Global demand for non-resilient flooring is expected to reach approximately 11.7 billion m[2] by 2020,
representing a CAGR of approximately 3.5% from 2015 through to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).
In 2015, ceramic tiles were the most popular category of non-resilient flooring globally, representing
approximately two thirds of the global demand for non-resilient flooring (Source: Freedonia Report). The

two other significant non-resilient flooring products in 2015 were wood and laminate, accounting for
approximately 13.0% and 8.0% of global non-resilient flooring demand, respectively (Source: Freedonia
Report).

Laminate is forecast to grow at the fastest rate among non-resilient flooring products, with an estimated
CAGR of approximately 7.3% from 2015 to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

**_Resilient Flooring_**

Resilient flooring products primarily encompass vinyl-based products but the segment also includes
asphalt, cork, linoleum and rubber. The key benefits of resilient flooring products include high underfoot
comfort, noise absorption, durability, high wear resistance and relatively lower cost. LVT have been gaining
popularity in recent years and demand is expected to continue to increase.

Global demand for resilient flooring is expected to reach approximately 2.3 billion m[2] by 2020,
representing a CAGR of approximately 3.0% from 2015 through to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report). In
2015, vinyl accounted for approximately 73.3% of global resilient flooring demand (Source: Freedonia
Report). Vinyl is forecast to grow at the fastest rate at an estimated CAGR of approximately 3.0% from
2015 to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

**_Soft-flooring_**

Soft-flooring products comprise woven and tufted broadloom carpets and carpet tiles, area rugs, bath mats,
door mats, staircase runners, as well as carpets for aircraft, motor vehicles and other products. In recent
years, global demand for soft-flooring products has lost market share to hard-flooring products, with
soft-flooring products market share declining from approximately 34.7% of Global Flooring Demand in
2005 to approximately 26.0% in 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report). This trend is expected to stabilize by
2020, with soft-flooring products projected to account for approximately 25.1% of Global Flooring
Demand (Source: Freedonia Report).

Global demand for soft-flooring products is forecast to reach approximately 4.7 billion m[2] in 2020,
representing a CAGR of approximately 2.2% from a demand of approximately 3.8 billion m[2] in 2010
(Source: Freedonia Report). In 2015, tufted products accounted for approximately 71.0% of global
soft-flooring demand (Source: Freedonia Report). Tufted products are forecast to grow at the fastest rate
at an estimated CAGR of approximately 2.5% from 2015 to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

We focus on the l&R end-market, which is significantly larger than the new construction end-market,
demonstrating our limited dependence on new construction activity. Additionally, the l&R end-market is
more price inelastic as flooring refurbishment is a cost-efficient method of aesthetic improvement relative
to other refurbishment alternatives.

**_Residential Buildings_**

Demand growth in the residential buildings end-market is forecasted to be constrained as a result of a
predicted decrease in global residential construction spending. Demand for flooring in the residential
buildings end-market is forecasted to reach approximately 10.1 billion m[2] by 2020 from approximately
8.9 billion m[2] in 2015, representing a CAGR of approximately 2.6% from 2015 through to 2020
(Source: Freedonia Report). This growth is broadly in-line with the CAGR for the 2010 to 2015 period
(Source: Freedonia Report).

The I&R end-market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.2%, reaching approximately
6.8 billion m[2] in 2020 compared to 6.1 billion m[2] in 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report). This is slower than
the expected CAGR for the new residential segment of approximately 3.3% over the same period
(Source: Freedonia Report). The growing popularity of hard-flooring products, which are more durable
than textiles and can often last at least two decades, are expected to limit growth rates in the l&R
end-market. However, demand is expected to benefit from increased personal income levels in developing
countries, making l&R projects more affordable.

**_Non-residential Buildings_**

Demand for flooring in the non-residential buildings end-market is projected to reach approximately
7.6 billion m[2] by 2020 from approximately 6.3 billion m[2] in 2015, representing a CAGR of approximately
3.8% over this period (Source: Freedonia Report). This expected CAGR is less than the CAGR of this
segment from 2010 to 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report).

Similar to the residential construction market, the non-residential l&R end-market is significantly larger
than the non-residential construction end-market, with non-residential l&R accounting for approximately
73.3% of global non-residential flooring demand in 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report). Demand for flooring
products in the non-residential I&R end-market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4.0% for
the period from 2015 to 2020, reaching around 5.6 billion m[2] by 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report). The
expected CAGR in this segment is slightly higher than the CAGR experienced in this segment from 2010
to 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report).

**_Transportation Equipment and Other Uses_**

The transportation equipment and other uses market includes a variety of vehicle types, from automobiles,
boats, recreational vehicles, vans, and other consumer-type equipment to aircraft, buses, rail cars, ships,
trucks, and other commercial vehicles. We do not have a significant presence in this end-market.

**Key Markets Overview**

Our key markets are the Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Spain (all of which are part of the
Western European market) as well as Australia (which is part of the Asia/Pacific market). We have
provided a general overview of these markets below.

**_United Kingdom Market Overview_**

_Overview_

The United Kingdom’s economy began a sustained recovery in 2013 as a result of improved conditions in
the manufacturing sector, recovery in the residential housing market and increases in business investment
spending. The United Kingdom is Western Europe’s second largest economy and is a key regional financial
hub. In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (‘‘Brexit’’). To date, the
potential effects of Brexit on foreign trade and investment remain unclear. GDP growth is forecasted to
slow, increasing at 1.8% annually up to 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

In 2015, the United Kingdom accounted for approximately 15.8% of total flooring demand in
Western Europe. Flooring demand in the United Kingdom is forecast to reach approximately 340 million
m[2] in 2020, representing a CAGR of approximately 1.2% from 2015 to 2020, which is largely consistent
with the CAGR of approximately 1.0% from 2010 to 2015 (Source: Freedonia Report). The United
Kingdom is projected to increase its share of the Western European flooring market from 15.8% in 2015 to
15.9% in 2020 (Source: Freedonia Report).

**Industry Composition**

**_Overview_**

The global floor covering industry is highly fragmented, consisting of a large number of manufacturers and
distributors offering a diversity of products. These companies range from small, privately-held businesses
focused on producing a single type of floor covering, to state-owned enterprises, to multinational

corporations with a diverse product offering. While there are a number of large players in the industry,
small and mid-sized companies dominate overall production.

In 2015, the top three producers, Mohawk Industries, Shaw Industries and Tarkett, collectively accounted
for approximately 6.5% of Global Flooring Demand market share (Source: Freedonia Report).

**_Competitors_**

We primarily operate within the residential segment of the flooring market, with a focus on supply to the
retail channel. We believe that we do not have any directly comparable competitors due to our diverse
product offering within our core markets in Europe and Australia. In our view, the industry landscape
within which Victoria operates can be broadly divided into three competitor market segments, namely,
soft-flooring specialists, ceramic tile specialists, and large multi-class producers.

Within the soft-flooring specialists segment, Balta, Condor Carpets and Associated Weavers are some of
the key, larger players with a strong presence in Europe. However, these companies do not have any
offering within resilient or non-resilient hard flooring. Furthermore, whilst all of these companies export to
the UK market, which is both the largest broadloom carpet market within Europe and our primary focus
within this segment, they do not have comparably broad distribution capabilities and are more reliant than
Victoria on local wholesalers and larger national retailers.

Within the ceramic tile specialists segment, Porcelanosa, Pamesa Ceramica and Baldocer, each based in
Spain, and Florim and Marazzi (the latter owned by Mohawk), based in Italy, are examples of key
competitors. However, none of these companies have resilient hard-flooring or soft-flooring product
offerings.

In terms of large multi-class producers, Tarkett, Forbo and Beaulieu International (Flooring Solutions
division) are the main players within Europe. Tarkett and Forbo are predominantly focused on the
manufacture and distribution of resilient hard-flooring products (where Victoria currently has a smaller,
selective presence) as well as products for commercial end-markets. The Flooring Solutions division of
Beaulieu International has a broader product offering, including a range of resilient and non-resilient
hard-flooring products as well as broadloom carpets, although no ceramic tile offering.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products across the United
Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, established in 1895 and publicly listed since 1963. We are the
largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia
and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both countries, in each case by volume. We are also a
leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer. We manufacture and supply a range of carpet,
ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, LVT, artificial grass and flooring accessories. The majority of our products
are for residential use and are sold through our retail customer base. We primarily target mid- to uppermarket product segments of the flooring industry as well as certain niche product segments. For the
52 weeks ended June 30, 2018, we generated £630.6 million of Adjusted _Pro Forma Revenue and_
£111.7 million of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA (17.7% Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA margin). While we
have grown over this period largely through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth was 2.8%, 4.6% and
1.6% (adjusted for the restructuring of certain UK operations and the impact of a weather-related business
interruption).

We offer a diversified product portfolio of flooring products, both in terms of product category and target
price point. Although originally focused on soft-flooring offerings, we have gained scale in the large and
fragmented flooring industry through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives to become a
major competitor in both the soft- and hard flooring markets. The following charts set forth our Pro Forma
Revenue and Pro Forma EBITDA by geography and product segment for the 2018 financial year.

We have a strong and long-standing presence in the UK carpet industry. To build on this competitive
advantage, we expanded into the complementary flooring underlay market by adding flooring underlay
operations in both the United Kingdom and Australia in 2015 and 2016. This was achieved through the
acquisitions of Interfloor in 2015 and Ezi Floor in 2016, flooring underlay manufacturers based in the
United Kingdom, and the 2016 acquisition of Dunlop, a flooring underlay manufacturer based in Australia.
In response to robust growth in demand for artificial grass, we further expanded into the artificial grass
market through our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands in 2017. Most recently, we
entered the ceramic flooring segment in Continental Europe through our acquisitions of Serra (Italy) and
Keraben (Spain) in 2017, and of Saloni (Spain) in 2018.

We have a highly successful multi-brand strategy with over 30 brands encompassing mid- to upper-priced
products. These include 14 carpet brands covering a broad range of wool and synthetic products, such as
Victoria, Whitestone Weavers, StainFree and Quest; Westex and Hugh Mackay, two of our premium
carpet brands; Duralay, Dunlop and Tredaire, leading and innovative flooring underlay brands; Keraben
and Saloni, mid- to upper-market ceramic flooring brands; Distinctive and Heartridge, under which we sell
high-end LVT products; and GrassInc and Avalon, under which we sell artificial grass products for a wide
range of applications, including parks, sports grounds, lawns and indoor applications.

We benefit from economies of scale through our consolidated manufacturing facilities in the United
Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Australia. Our business is selectively vertically

116


-----

integrated, comprising three components: (i) the design and specification of the majority of our products;
(ii) the manufacturing of the substantial majority of our products, with limited outsourcing in
circumstances in which doing so is financially and operationally beneficial; and (iii) the distribution of our
products based on their product category and customer proposition, which maximizes the turnover of our
inventory and product efficiency. We believe that this balanced approach to vertical integration creates
robust margins and increases our competitive advantage in our target markets. We believe we have
competitive advantages in the markets in which we operate, including our design capabilities, large-scale
and efficient in-house manufacturing facilities and our long-standing direct relationships with retailers
across all operating businesses.

We operate nine manufacturing sites in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and five
manufacturing sites in Australia. Our integrated in-house capabilities allow us to operate our production
facilities flexibly, varying production levels as appropriate, while maintaining a low fixed cost base, high
efficiency and rigorous quality control. Where advantageous to do so, we have consolidated the design,
manufacturing and distribution of certain of our products.

Our core markets are the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, where we employ over
3,000 people across more than 20 sites. The largest end-market for our products is the I&R end-market,
and, therefore, our business is less exposed to the economic cycles that otherwise commonly affect the
cyclical construction end-market. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical
segments in which they are manufactured, placing us in close proximity to our customer bases across core
markets. Our relationships with our customers, the thousands of flooring retailers and small number of
distributors and direct sales customers we supply across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and
Australia, are central to our success. We primarily sell directly to retailers. In the United Kingdom alone,
our 3,000-plus customers range from independent retailers to distributors and large format chains. Some of
these relationships, across operating geographies, are multi-generational and we believe the strength and
depth of these relationships represent a significant competitive advantage. When coupled with our recent
expansion, these relationships allow us to offer a broad range of products to our customers and further our
cross-selling opportunities. We benefit from a large, diverse customer base with limited concentration. For
the 2018 financial year, our top ten customers constituted approximately 15% of our Pro Forma Revenue,
with our largest customer constituting approximately 4% of our Pro Forma Revenue.

**Strengths**

**_Market-leading business with an efficient global footprint_**

We have built a market-leading business across our core markets with a wide product range and global
production and distribution capabilities. We are the largest carpet manufacturer in the United Kingdom,
with approximately 9% market share, the second largest carpet manufacturer in Australia, with
approximately 7% market share, and the largest flooring underlay manufacturer in both jurisdictions, in
each case by volume. We are also a leading Continental European ceramic tile manufacturer in the mid- to
upper-market ceramic flooring segment by volume, with approximately 5% market share.

We manufacture a broad range of innovative products, which we distribute to leading retailers and
wholesalers across commercial and residential end-markets globally. The Group is headquartered in the
United Kingdom, with operations across the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Australia, employing over 3,000 people at more than 20 sites, including highly automated, flexible and
efficient manufacturing facilities. Our production sites across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe
and Australia enable us to service demand in local as well as nearby markets. Through our recent
acquisitions of Keraben and Saloni in Spain, Serra in Italy, GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands and
Millennium in Belgium, we have increased our distribution of revenues across Continental Europe while
maintaining our efficient margin strategy.

We have increased efficiencies across our business by consolidating production in locations with excess
capacity while rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. At the same time, we enhanced our logistics
capabilities in the United Kingdom, which is our largest geographical segment. In 2017, we began the
reorganization of our United Kingdom manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve
productivity, manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our
Kidderminster factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the ongoing relocation of our
distribution center in the Midlands. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our United Kingdom
carpet production being shared between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We anticipate
that further efficiency gains will be made from the completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center

117


-----

near London, servicing all of our brands, and the potential for a further new distribution center in northern
England.

We believe that our market-leading positions across our key end-markets, together with our wide product
range and our global distribution capabilities allow us to closely track and adapt to customer behavior
while adjusting our production levels to match demand. Specifically, as a result of our presence in multiple
product segments, our vertical integration and significant contacts across retailers, we are able to receive
substantial feedback as to end-consumer trends in design and supply volumes on a timely basis.

**_Stable flooring market dominated by the less cyclical improvement and repair end-market_**

The United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring markets are stable, mature and
attractive end-markets. Our core markets, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia, are
expected to undergo stable economic growth in the coming years. According to the Freedonia Report, this
economic growth is expected to translate into increased overall demand in the flooring industry across our
core markets. The combined United Kingdom, Continental European and Australian flooring market is
forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.2% between 2015 and 2020, with the I&R end-market
forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.8% over the same period. The hard-flooring market is
expected to experience the most substantial growth in the flooring industry. Demand for resilient flooring
(consisting primarily of vinyl, rubber and linoleum) is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.0%,
followed by non-resilient flooring (consisting primarily of ceramic, laminate and wood) at a CAGR of
approximately 3.5%. The non-resilient flooring market is expected to grow at a particularly robust pace in
Australia, a market characterized by a large building and construction sector, a high standard of living and
positive macroeconomic environment, at a CAGR of approximately 3.6% between 2015 and 2020. We
believe that our rapid and successful expansion into the hard-flooring market in Continental Europe, as
well as our sizeable presence in Australia supported by our current optimization initiatives, collectively
enable us to defend our position and take advantage of these growth trends.

In addition to the stable growth forecast for the flooring industry generally, our business benefits
specifically from our focus on the I&R end-market. The I&R end-market in the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe is approximately four to five times larger than the new construction end-market and
has limited dependence on new construction activity. Demand for new flooring in the new construction
end-market tends to lag overall growth in new construction and is typically more volatile than the I&R
end-market due to the cyclical nature of new construction activity. Conversely, the I&R end-market, which
is driven by consistent wear-and-tear damage and the desire to upgrade the appearance of existing homes,
is characterized by greater price inelasticity and is typically less susceptible to business cycles. Based on the
composition of our customer base, we believe that over 80% of our revenues are generated from the I&R
end-market.

**_Established market position in an industry with high barriers to entry_**

Over the course of our operating history, we have developed sufficient scale, expertise and breadth of
product offering to succeed notwithstanding the significant barriers to entry in the flooring industry. We
believe this business model would be difficult to replicate due to the following structural barriers to entry:

- **Fragmented customer base: Our broad customer base is dominated by independent retailers, with**
whom we enjoy long-standing and, we believe, mutually beneficial relationships;

- **Strength of brands: We have a diverse portfolio of over 30 brands that we believe enjoy strong**
recognition with customers;

- **Globally priced key raw materials costs: Raw materials constitute the majority of our cost of**
production. Our primary raw materials are synthetic yarn, clay, natural gas, polyurethane foam and
trim and rubber, which have relatively consistent global pricing. As a result, we are able to keep
certain of our costs competitive with low-cost international manufacturers looking to distribute their
products within our geographical segments;

- **Difficulty in transport of products: Carpets are large, non-palletized goods and ceramic tiles are heavy,**
making both products difficult and expensive to transport. High transportation costs are another
barrier preventing low-cost international manufacturers from distributing their products within our
geographical segments. We sell the substantial majority of our products in the same geographical
segments in which they are manufactured, which minimizes our transportation costs;

118


-----

- **Difficulty in contract manufacturing: Long production runs are required in our industry in order to**
enable cost-effective manufacturing. As a result, contract manufacturing is not a feasible alternative to
the owned production capabilities that we have; and

- **Capital barriers and technical expertise: New entrants seeking to establish operations locally would**
face significant up-front capital costs and a scarcity of technical and production expertise.

We believe these barriers to entry protect our business from both the threat of inexpensive, international
imports as well as new entrants to our local markets.

**_Highly diversified business across products, geographies and customers_**

We have a diverse product portfolio consisting of wool and synthetic broadloom carpets, ceramic tiles,
laminate, flooring underlay, LVT and other hardwood flooring products, artificial grass, carpet tiles and
flooring accessories. These products are spread across over 30 brands. Notably, while we have sought to
selectively expand our product portfolio, we have strategically elected not to enter into product markets
characterized by low margins and high price competition, such as linoleum. We primarily target the mid- to
upper markets and employ a commercially focused product development process to proactively manage
our margins. Our design, quality control, production and cost control processes inform one another and
are designed to yield product specifications that align with our target customers’ price points while
optimizing margins.

Our customer relationships and manufacturing flexibility also aid diversification of our product portfolio.
Our close relationships with our customers provide us with valuable feedback and enable us to adapt to
changes in end-customer preferences. We are also able to avoid large-scale product warehousing because
of our ability to rapidly scale production on short notice, allowing us to maintain lean inventory levels
which further aid product diversification.

The evolution of our product range has been targeted and deliberate, underpinned by selective acquisitions
through which we have increased production flexibility and our product and geographical diversification.
As a result of this careful expansion, we are not overly dependent on any particular product segment, with
ceramic flooring products, carpet products and flooring underlay constituting 39%, 37% and 18% of our
revenue for the 2018 financial year after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisitions. Additionally, we are
not unduly dependent on any particular brand (with Keraben constituting the largest proportion of our
sales at 18.3%) or geographical segment and have the flexibility to produce and serve multiple geographies
and shift production as needed based on fluctuations in demand. After giving _pro forma effect to the_
Acquisitions, 60.6% of our revenue by origin was generated outside of the United Kingdom for the 2018
financial year.

Through our portfolio of over 30 brands, we offer a broad, differentiated and regularly evolving product
portfolio for a variety of end-markets, including residential, office and hospitality and leisure. The breadth
of these offerings provide us with a diverse customer base consisting of independent retailers, national
retailers, DIY retailers and buying groups, with over 3,000 customers in the United Kingdom, over 2,000
customers in Continental Europe and approximately 800 customers in Australia. These retailers are highly
diversified across specialist, non-specialist, general and DIY sales channels. The chart below sets forth our
customer distribution by sales channel through the 2018 financial year, pro forma for the Acquisitions.

Significantly, the vast majority of our products are sold directly to independent flooring retailers rather
than third-party distributors, which we believe drives brand loyalty and long-term relationships. Our
involvement in the supply chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold directly to
consumers, optimizing margins. Unlike some of our competitors, a minority of our revenue is generated
from large retail chains. Approximately 55% of our revenue comes from independent retailers (including

119


-----

DIY retailers) while approximately 25% comes from large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2018 financial
year, no customer represented more than 4% of our revenue with our largest ten customers accounting for
approximately 15% of our revenue.

We believe that the breadth of our product offering and the diversity of our revenue streams support the
resilience of our business and that our sales of products across a number of attractive flooring segments
increases our cross-selling opportunities, visibility and pricing power. We further believe that our wide
product offering, expansive geographic footprint and diverse base of customers strengthen our position as
a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative flooring products while positioning us for
future growth.

**_Low operational gearing through a flexible cost base and low capital expenditure requirements_**

We benefit from low operational gearing, with 54% of our costs (46% of our cost base as a percentage of
our revenues) for the 2018 financial year (pro forma for the Acquisitions) varying directly with revenue. A
further 31% of our costs (26% of our cost base as a percentage of revenues) for the 2018 financial year
(pro forma for the Acquisitions), is semi-variable, with the ability to adapt within a few months. We have
been able to maintain this low operational gearing despite being a manufacturing business by automating
certain processes and because our equipment generally has a very long useful life. We also benefit from
multiple production sites with the flexibility, capacity and cost structure to vary production levels, enabling
our business to maintain efficiency in favorable markets and resilience through the more challenging parts
of the business cycle.

Further, as much of our plant and equipment is relatively inexpensive and can be replaced on a modular
basis, our business requires a limited amount of maintenance capital expenditures relative to our cash
flows. Of our capital expenditures for the 2018 financial year, £14.1 million related to maintenance and
£15.2 million related to growth. While our maintenance capital expenditures have increased on an absolute
basis over the last three years, our maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of our total revenue
remained relatively stable, at 4.0%, 3.3% and 3.3% for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years,
respectively.

**_Strong financial performance with resilience through economic downturns_**

We were resilient throughout the financial crisis, increasing revenue in each of 2006–2011. Our focus on
the less cyclical I&R end-market made us less susceptible to from the worst effects of the financial crisis,
during which time consumers opted for less expensive forms of home improvement. While we shifted our
sales mix to lower than average selling prices in order to protect sales volumes, we were able to utilize our
flexible cost base to maintain our margins.

Since the financial crisis, we have expanded our product portfolio, developed a more efficient production
footprint and introduced better inventory management. We now offer an expanded product portfolio and
have shifted from a pure carpeting business to a hard and soft-flooring group, with a range of carpet,
ceramic tiles, flooring underlay, LVT and artificial grass products. As a result of our increased scale
through acquisitions and various operational initiatives, we also possess a more efficient production
footprint and better inventory management. We believe that these changes have strengthened our
underlying business and leave us poised to capitalize on the more favorable macroeconomic backdrop,
especially as we have also diversified geographically in both manufacturing and sales without
over-exposure to any single geographic market.

Since the change in our management in 2012, we have experienced a period of accelerated growth coupled
with improvements in EBITDA margins, increasing from 7.2% in the 2014 financial year to 15.2% in the
2018 financial year. These increases began with a restructuring in the 2013 financial year that included a
one-off stock rationalization and mill consolidation to reduce excess capacity. Further, we have maintained
consistently high Operating Cash Flow Conversion of 99.4%, 95.4% and 99.7% in the 2018, 2017 and 2016
financial years, respectively. This strong free cash flow generation has allowed us to de-lever following new
acquisitions, and has been supported by relatively limited working capital requirements and stable capital
expenditures that have grown in proportion to the growth in our business since 2014.

We remain committed to continuing margin growth in our existing businesses. In 2017, we began the
reorganization of our UK manufacturing footprint and logistics operations to improve productivity,
manufacturing capacity and customer service. This process included the closure of our Kidderminster
factory, which we completed in September 2017, and the ongoing relocation of our distribution center in

120


-----

the Midlands. Closure of the Kidderminster factory resulted in our UK carpet production being shared
between two factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We anticipate that further efficiency gains will
be made from the completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center near London, servicing all of
our brands, and the potential for a further new distribution center in northern England.

In line with this focus, we announced our intention to rationalize our flooring underlay production
facilities in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, which we acquired in January 2017 and plan to concentrate
production in a single facility in the second half of 2019. We acquired these two facilities in Sydney and
Melbourne through our purchase of Dunlop Flooring in January 2017. We have decided to concentrate our
manufacturing activity at our existing Sydney site while closing the site near Melbourne. Together with an
investment of approximately AUD $2.1 million in new technology, this initiative is expected to improve raw
material processing, finishing and packaging at the Sydney site. This combination of rationalization and
investment are intended to increase our operational agility and result in a more efficient and productive
operation.

**_Proven acquisition track record and ability to realize synergies_**

Since 2013, we have participated in the consolidation of a highly fragmented industry and believe we have
built a reputation as a credible acquirer. Though we aim to maximize the realization of synergies following
an acquisition, our strategy is primarily focused on acquiring high-quality, high-margin targets that we
intend to operate as stand-alone propositions. We seek to acquire businesses that are growing and
profitable, with high-quality facilities and products as well as competitive advantages in production and
distribution. Our acquisition targets generally possess sustainable above-average margins and are led by
committed and capable management teams. We believe this focus on stand-alone business value allows us
to minimize our downside acquisition risk while maintaining room for synergistic upside potential.

Since the change in Group management in 2013, we have made 13 acquisitions, including the recent
acquisitions of Keraben, Serra and Saloni. Over this period, our Underlying EBITDA has grown from
£2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to £64.7 million in the 2018 financial year, and, after giving effect to
the Acquisitions, our Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA in the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018 was_
£111.7 million.

Our increased scale through acquisitions has given us significant opportunities for margin improvement.
We possess better buying power for raw materials and have consolidated our manufacturing, distribution,
warehousing and logistics capacity. Additionally, the acquisition of production capacity and development
of distribution facilities in close proximity to our clients is also a competitive advantage, as the high levels
of customer dispersion typical in the flooring industry can generate substantial distribution costs. Our
strategically located distribution facilities allow us to minimize these costs and access customers in a timely
and cost-effective manner. Through our increased scale, we have also been able to rationalize product
lines, improve working capital management through SKU reduction and take advantage of cross-selling
products through new distribution channels. As a result of the above, our acquisition strategy has resulted
in realized margin synergies, as evidenced by the increase in our Underlying EBITDA margin from 3.3% in
the 2013 financial year to 15.2% in the 2018 financial year.

We have a long history of creativity and innovation in the flooring industry, both technical and aesthetic,
and we are well-positioned to develop, together with our customers, design concepts and create innovative
products that are tailored to consumers’ tastes and preferences. Our strategic acquisitions in the ceramic
tile and artificial grass segments position us to continue to offer products tailored to a contemporary
audience. We continue to introduce new product collections every year to meet consumer preferences and
trends.

**_Experienced management team with proven track record of sustainable value creation_**

We have a strong and experienced management team that has positioned us for continued growth and
development. Geoffrey Wilding, responsible for our rapid and successful expansion, joined the Group as
Executive Chairman in 2012 and drives overall Group strategy. The 2018 financial year was Philippe
Hamers’ first full year as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hamers has over 25 years of experience in the
flooring industry, most recently chairing Europe’s largest carpet manufacturing operation before assuming
his role with us.

We operate a ‘‘team of teams’’ structure that minimizes cost friction and red tape, while capitalizing on
local expertise and allowing organic local strategies to flourish. Our global operating strategy is generated

121


-----

centrally by Group-level management, including budgeting, capital expenditure planning and crossbusiness operations. Complementing our Group-level strategy, we maintain a decentralized structure with
Managing Directors responsible for the day-to-day management of each of our core operating businesses.
Within the limits of our overall strategy and objectives, each Managing Director develops their own
strategy and tactics (reviewed by the Board) to deliver their targets.

Our management team has a strong track record of identifying value-accretive acquisition targets,
integrating the acquired companies and identifying and achieving synergies. In selectively growing our
operations, we look for mature businesses with modern, well-invested production facilities, committed
management teams, established distribution channels and competitive advantages in the relevant target
market. Once a business has been acquired, we have historically been able to deliver significant production
and purchasing synergies, which continue to drive growth in operating margins and improved like-for-like
performance, as evidenced by five consecutive years of increasing EBITDA margins.

Importantly, we are focused on retaining the management teams at our operating business level, a strategy
that has proved successful for the Group. We have retained nearly all members of management in
post-acquisition earn-out periods and, out of the 13 acquisitions made by the Group since 2013, seven are
either post earn-out or did not have an earn-out period. In addition, our divisional management teams
have extensive experience in the flooring industry and we believe that their collective industry knowledge,
technical expertise, and customer and supplier relationships will enable them to continue to grow our
business and execute our strategies.

**Strategy**

**_Continue to generate sustainable organic top-line growth in selected product segments_**

Our growth since 2013 has created a consolidated platform in carpeting, flooring underlay, flooring
accessories, ceramic flooring and LVT products. While the Group has grown over this period largely
through strategic acquisitions, like-for-like growth was 2.8%, 4.6% and 1.6% (adjusted for operations and
the impact of a weather-related business interruption) for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years,
respectively. We intend to continue to utilize our platform in order to defend our market position, develop
new products, and leverage our distribution channels to drive organic top-line growth.

When investing in our organic development, we target product segments in which we benefit from existing
high margins and where we can increase operational efficiencies. For example, we benefit from high
margins in our ceramic flooring segments, and have planned investments in Keraben to increase ceramic
production capacity. These investments include the development of a new production plant anticipated to
begin production in 2020, the installation of new clay atomizers in floor and wall plants designed to
increase clay reception capacity and the installation of new inkjet printing machines for wall and floor
pressing and glazing processes. Additionally, in the 2018 financial year we completed the rationalization of
our UK manufacturing footprint by closing our Kidderminster factory, with our UK carpet manufacturing
now being shared between factories located in Yorkshire and South Wales. We recently announced a
similar initiative in Australia, which will result in the consolidation of our two flooring underlay factories
into a single, enlarged facility located in Sydney. We have also strengthened our UK logistics network,
including through the establishment of our new Southern Distribution Center and the relocation of our
Midlands distribution center. We intend to continue refining the multi-site operation of this distribution
network. In addition to optimizing our cost base, these initiatives are a competitive advantage as they allow
our customers to distribute their products more efficiently, which we believe will drive increased sales.

While our primary focus is on sales to retailers and the I&R market, we also aim to grow our contract
offering directly to end-market consumers, particularly within the hospitality and leisure and construction
end-markets. Though our Whitestone operating business currently services clients within these
end-markets, we have identified these end-markets as targets for organic expansion as our existing
presence is minimal. In light of our growing ceramic tile and LVT product offerings, we have begun
designing and creating products specifically for these product segments with our sales teams concentrating
marketing efforts in these areas.

We are also making targeted investments into new product development and associated marketing
materials, aided by our selective acquisitions in new strategic areas in which we believe there is superior
and sustainable market growth and high margins. For example, we have expanded into the attractive
Continental European ceramic flooring industry with our acquisitions of Keraben, Saloni and Serra.
Non-resilient flooring, mostly consisting of the ceramic flooring segment, remains the most popular

122


-----

flooring solution across Continental Europe. Additionally, our acquisitions of GrassInc and Avalon give us
a foothold in the rapidly expanding global artificial grass industry. We believe there are large,
underpenetrated markets for these and other products and we intend to leverage the scale of our footprint
and our diverse distribution channels in order to capitalize on these opportunities.

**_Acquisitive growth to realize margin-driving synergies and integration_**

Since 2013, we have become a consolidator in a highly fragmented industry and have built a reputation as a
disciplined and credible acquirer. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic initiatives, the Group
has grown from having Underlying EBITDA of £2.3 million in the 2013 financial year to Adjusted _Pro_
_Forma EBITDA of £111.7 million in the 52 weeks ended June 30, 2018._

This growth supports our belief that the flooring market is suitable for further consolidation.
Manufacturing in our industry is characterized by many small, inefficient and privately owned
manufacturers; for example, there are over 250 manufacturers in the United Kingdom and Continental
Europe. The 20 largest flooring producers globally only represented approximately 12% of global revenues
in 2015. Further, we are generally insulated from large-scale competition within the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe as the largest global manufacturers operate in the United States.

Small manufacturers offer potential economies of scale, stable backgrounds and typically operate in the
I&R end-market, which is less sensitive to economic cycles. Most carpet manufacturers trade at or below
net asset value and, therefore, incumbent owners are often keen to exit. With many retiring owners lacking
a succession plan, we are seen as an ideal buyer among few buying players in the market. We are constantly
sourcing new opportunities for acquisitive growth and aim to make two-to-three high-quality,
complementary acquisitions per year.

The acquisition origination process begins with a long list of market participants. Our policy is to avoid
acquiring turnarounds, so we only invest in currently profitable and cash-generative businesses. After
months of contact with the target’s management, and due diligence on the target’s operating sites and
financials, we consider commercial and cultural fit, possible synergies and terms of the possible acquisition.
In addition to our focus on well-run businesses with strong management teams, we stress contingent
structuring of consideration, to motivate the target and to share downside risk. With strong, rational
adherence to our acquisition strategy, we have been able to limit our downside risk.

Our consistent growth through acquisitions has allowed us to use our scale to drive operating margins.
After an acquisition, we maintain the target’s customer-facing teams, such as design, branding, sales and
marketing. This feet-on-the-ground approach allows for product and brand differentiation while
simultaneously maintaining responsiveness to dynamic customer demand. At the same time, operational
integration drives the realization of cost-savings synergies in procurement, production, logistics and IT.
These initiatives result in better buying terms with suppliers of raw materials, better working capital
management through SKU reduction and rationalization of product lines and manufacturing assets.
Importantly, our acquisition strategy creates the potential for further future consolidation of
manufacturing capacity. We are able to realize depot, fleet and load consolidation for a more efficient
logistical process. More efficient retail network relationships created through consolidation also yield
commercial synergies such as product bundling and cross-selling while further driving sales growth and
SKU reduction.

**_Generate free cash flow to enable de-leveraging_**

A hallmark of a successful flooring business is its generation of free cash flow and high cash conversion
rates. These are due to the longevity of flooring manufacturing plants, the relatively low capital
requirements of those plants, relatively inelastic demand, and price inelasticity. When coupled with our
synergistic acquisitions, we have consistently been able to consolidate production capability, increasing
utilization, reducing SKUs, increasing stock turnover and establishing favorable trading terms with
suppliers and customers. Together, these elements have the effect of further increasing our free cash flow.
High free cash flow, in turn, allows us to rapidly de-lever.

Despite our consistent track record of growing through acquisitions, we have successfully maintained
stable net leverage. Maintaining low leverage ensures the long-term health of the Group and gives us
headroom for further acquisitions. While we expect our pro forma senior net leverage to increase to 3.0x
after giving effect to the Transactions, we intend to return to historical leverage levels in the near future.

**_History_**

We were established in 1895 as a carpet manufacturing business and have grown to an international scale
in subsequent years. We have been publicly listed since 1963, moving from the London Stock Exchange’s
Main Market to its AIM Market in 2013. When Geoffrey Wilding joined as Executive Chairman in 2012, a
new board was appointed to conduct a full strategic review of the Group. In 2014, Mr. Wilding acquired a
controlling stake in the Group. Since our formation, we have grown beyond our initial soft-flooring
offerings and gained scale through acquisitions in the fragmented flooring industry diversifying both by
product and geography.

Since 2013, we have made 13 acquisitions across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Australia
to become a global player in the flooring industry. In late 2017, we expanded our position in Continental
Europe, with the acquisition of Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Both Serra and Keraben are
Continental European hard flooring manufacturers. Also, in early 2017, in response to the robust growth
of the artificial grass market, we gained artificial grass-manufacturing capability through our acquisitions of
GrassInc and Avalon in the Netherlands. We have additionally acquired the business and assets of
Millennium in 2017, a carpet distribution business based in Belgium, further enhancing our presence in the
UK high-volume market. Most recently, in August 2018, we further increased our presence in the
Continental European hard flooring market with our acquisition of Saloni, a Spanish ceramic tile
manufacturer.

In 2013, Victoria Carpets Limited, one of our core historic operating subsidiaries, was awarded the
Queen’s Royal Warrant and further supplied the red carpet for the wedding of Prince William and
Catherine Middleton, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

**Operating Businesses and Products**

Our business is principally divided according to geographical location, with our businesses in the United
Kingdom and Continental Europe operating largely independent of our businesses in Australia. Within
these geographical segments, we own a number of operating businesses that service a range of product
categories. Outside of these core geographical segments, we also sell a small amount of our products into
other geographies, such as North America and Asia.

Our UK & Europe segment is comprised of 12 operating businesses and more than 20 brands, spanning a
product offering which includes broadloom carpeting, ceramic tiles, flooring underlay and flooring
accessories, LVT, artificial grass and hardwood flooring. Our Australia segment comprises three operating
businesses and includes our Quest, Dunlop, Victoria (Australia) and Heartridge brands, spanning a
product offering which includes broadloom carpeting, flooring underlay and LVT. Our brands typically
benefit from a focus on mid- to upper-market product segments, our long operational track record in
developed markets and our reputation for quality production among our customers.

(1) Includes luxury vinyl tile (LVT), carpet tiles, wood flooring and artificial grass products.

**_Broadloom carpets_**

In our carpet segment, we design, manufacture and distribute a broad range of mechanically tufted carpets
to independent retailers (such as specialist, home improvement and furniture stores) and to wholesalers.
We also manufacture a small amount of carpet products which are used for niche end-market uses, such as
for use in feature films or bespoke automobiles. We provide carpeting products for both indoor and
outdoor use, with our offerings including braided, hooked, needle-punched and tufted carpeting. The
carpet products we sell are mid- to upper-market offerings made of wool and synthetic materials.

We manufacture our carpet products within the United Kingdom and Australia and sell locally within these
markets. We benefit from their historical carpeting production infrastructure and the clear local consumer
preference for carpeting over other types of flooring products.

Our carpet segment accounted for £230.8 million, or 37.0%, of our _Pro Forma Revenue for the 2018_
financial year.

**_Ceramic flooring_**

In our ceramic flooring segment, we design, manufacture and distribute mid- to upper-market ceramic
flooring products, selling mainly to specialist retailers of ceramic flooring and smaller DIY retailers.
Ceramic tiles constitute the large majority of non-resilient flooring demand throughout our geographical
segments, and we export significant amounts of our ceramic products outside of the traditional ceramic tile
manufacturing bases of Spain and Italy. We export these products primarily to countries within Continental
Europe.

In 2016, we expanded from our historic focus on carpeting with the aim of capturing opportunities in the
ceramic tile market, as an increasing proportion of flooring sold is ceramic tiles. In November 2017, we
acquired Serra in Italy and Keraben in Spain. Serra is an efficient, mid-market manufacturer of ceramic
flooring products, supplying retailers, distributors and DIY chains throughout Continental Europe.
Keraben is one of Spain’s largest ceramic tile manufacturers with a reputation for high quality products
and customer service. We further increased our footprint in the ceramic flooring segment with our recent
2018 acquisition of Saloni, a Spanish manufacturer of upper-market ceramic tiles, giving us better access to
the ceramic flooring market. As a result of these acquisitions we have a high-quality operating presence in
two of the world’s premium regions for ceramic production.

Our ceramic flooring segment accounted for £244.8 million, or 39.3%, of our Pro Forma Revenue for the
2018 financial year.

**_Flooring underlay and flooring accessories_**

We design, manufacture and distribute mid- to upper-market flooring underlay products for both soft- and
hard flooring. Flooring underlay is a thin layer of cushioning, often made from synthetic materials, and
placed under flooring products such as carpeting or hardwood to increase underfoot comfort. These
products are produced by our flooring underlay operating businesses in the United Kingdom and
Australia, and are sold locally through a mixture of independent and large national retailers. As underlay
benefits from ease of large-scale storage, we are able to supply large national retailers for this product
segment in contrast to our traditional focus on independent retailers.

125


-----

Flooring accessories generally include materials which assist with the fitting of soft-flooring products.
These flooring accessories include products such as carpet gripper rods, which prevent carpet movement
and slippage, and which can be glued, taped or nailed to wooden or concrete sub-floors. We manufacture
these products through Interfloor, one of our operating businesses in the United Kingdom.

Our flooring underlay and flooring accessory segment accounted for £113.0 million, or 18.1%, of our Pro
_Forma Revenue for the 2018 financial year._

**_Other_**

Artificial grass, LVT and other flooring products together accounted for £34.4 million, or 5.5%, of our Pro
_Forma Revenue for the 2018 financial year._

_Artificial Grass_

Our artificial grass products are designed and specified by our artificial grass operating businesses in the
Netherlands, and manufactured by third party manufacturers also based in the Netherlands. These uppermarket products are subsequently distributed across the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, serving
the rapidly growing artificial grass industry.

_LVT_

Luxury vinyl tile is a resilient hard flooring product, which currently is a small but fast-growing area of the
hard flooring segment. LVT is offered at a lower price point than non-resilient flooring and benefit from
high underfoot comfort, noise absorption, durability and wear resistance. Our LVT products are designed
and specified by our LVT operating businesses in the United Kingdom and Australia, and are
manufactured by third party manufacturers in Asia before being distributed in the United Kingdom and
Australia. Unlike other flooring products such as broadloom carpet and ceramic tile, LVT is easily
manufactured and transported, which allows us to outsource our manufacturing production.

_Other flooring products_

We design, manufacture and distribute small quantities of carpet tiles under our historic Victoria Carpets
brand in the United Kingdom. Carpet tiles are modular carpet products, sold in squares, which are almost
exclusively used in offices or for other commercial uses.

We also design, manufacture and distribute small quantities of hardwood flooring in Australia under our
Heartridge brand as part of our Dunlop operating business.

**Sales**

We generally operate a business-to-business sales model and therefore rarely access our end-consumers
directly. Consequently, we rely on our customers’ ability to sell and market our products effectively in
order to increase our revenue and generate sustainable cash flows. As our customers grow, they tend also
to increase their orders with us. We seek to maintain strong relationships with our customers and work
collaboratively with them to help increase store traffic and grow their business.

Significantly, we sell the vast majority of our products directly to flooring retailers, which comprise
approximately 80% of our sales on a _pro forma basis, rather than third-party distributors, driving brand_
loyalty and long-term relationships. In order to maximize our profit margins, our involvement in the supply
chain tends to end at distribution, with products rarely being sold direct to consumers. A small portion of
our revenue is generated from large retail chains, and we benefit from a diversified customer base. Unlike
some of our competitors, approximately 55% of our revenue comes from independent retailers (including
DIY retailers) while 25% comes from large retail chains. Additionally, in the 2018 financial year and pro
_forma for the Acquisitions, our largest ten customers only accounted for approximately 15% of our_
revenue, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 4% of our revenue. No single customer
represented more than 10% of our revenue for the 2018 financial year. Outside the top 10 customers, we
have a diversified base of over 5,000 customers. We also sell certain of our products in certain jurisdictions
to wholesalers where there is a structural or commercial rationale for doing so, and engage in a small
amount of contract work for the construction or hospitality industry (approximately 10% of Group revenue
_pro forma for the Acquisitions)._

126


-----

We maintain a decentralized operating structure, with each of our operating subsidiaries possessing its own
front-office sales team. Each sales office has its own organization, responding to the structural
particularities of that geographical segment and the preferences of the local region. One of the strengths of
our sales force is its ability to respond to local demand. Our sales professionals use a variety of sales tools
and techniques to promote our products. These include the distributing of samples, advertising in trade
publications, participating in trade fairs, distributing point of sales materials, and establishing showrooms.

In keeping with industry practices, we do not have formal purchase arrangements with a substantial
majority of our customers. Purchase arrangements do not have standard terms and conditions, are typically
on a non-exclusive basis, contain no minimum purchase obligations and do not have a fixed term or may be
terminated on short notice.

We believe that our market-leading positions across our core markets, together with our wide product
range and our global production and distribution capabilities, allow us to closely track and adapt to
customer behavior and adjust our production levels to match demand. We analyze our sales data and we
are able to identify target end-customers and price points. We also use our data to identify product range
gaps or product ranges that require replacement. Our analysis drives our design process.

**_End-Market_**

We believe, based on the composition of our customer base that the majority of our products are for
residential use. Residential buildings encompass single-family homes, multi-family structures and
manufactured housing. This residential end-market can be further classified as either new construction or
I&R (with I&R constituting the majority of the residential flooring market). Based on the high number of
independent retailers we supply, we believe the I&R end-market also constitutes the large majority of our
sales. New residential construction flooring demand follows the growth in new building construction, while
I&R is directly linked to personal income levels. The non-residential end-market consists of office, retail,
institutional, industrial and other business or government facilities. Flooring in the non-residential
end-market can also be classified as either new construction or I&R, with the latter also representing
around three-quarters of demand in the non-residential end-market. In particular, businesses with heavy
decorative flooring needs (e.g. hotels and other hospitality facilities) drive growth in the non-residential
I&R end-market.

**Design**

We believe we are at the forefront of design in the flooring industry. We employ a commercially-focused
design process, centered on four strategic pillars: aesthetic design, quality, operations and cost. The
product design and development team leverages the strong relationships we have with our customers in
order to coordinate our product development strategy and to ensure the rapid development and launch of
innovative offerings and product upgrades. In particular, as a result of our vertical integration, our
significant contacts with retailers and our presence in multiple product segments, we are able to receive
substantial feedback regarding end-consumer trends in design, pricing and supply volumes.

We follow consumer preferences and demand trends closely. We use a systematic approach to collection
planning, and we maintain a short design-to-product cycle. Our design, quality control, production and cost
control processes are mutually reinforcing, resulting in product specifications that align with our target
customers and price points while ensuring optimal margins. We have the ability to set up our machines and
re-engineer our production facilities, as well as increase our production capacity to manufacture new and
different products in response to changing trends and consumer preferences. In addition, the breadth of
our product offerings and our ability to redeploy our machines to make new designs makes us less subject
to the success or failure of any given collection.

New products must also meet our high-quality standards; and, weight, thickness, durability and finish are
among the elements that we evaluate. Because of our high-quality standards, manufacturing feasibility is
another primary consideration. We also assess our existing production capacity; from an operations
perspective, we assess the ease of integration of a new potential product into existing production runs and
its impact on SKU and stock management. We also perform standard cost and margin assessments of a
potential new offering.

127

**Manufacturing**

**_Raw Materials_**

Our in-house manufacturing is centered around our carpeting, ceramics and underlay segments. For
carpeting products, synthetic yarn remains the largest single raw material expense. Though synthetic yarn is
an oil-based product, we benefit from minimal price-pressure because we source materials globally from a
large number of suppliers. The primary raw materials of our ceramic offerings are clay, which we are able
to source locally in Spain and Italy, and natural gas supply, for which we maintain a 12-month forwardhedging policy. Underlay can also be manufactured using polyurethane foam (‘‘PU’’) trim or rubber: PU is
a ‘‘virgin’’ waste product from other manufacturing industries, such as furniture manufacturing, and can be
sourced from a global market. Rubber prices have consistently declined over the last decade. Because we
manufacture underlay using both PU and rubber, we can alternate production to reflect price increases in
either PU or rubber.

Our raw materials expense was £287.1 million, which is equivalent to 46% of our Adjusted _Pro Forma_
Revenue for the 2018 financial year.

**_Supply Chain_**

We have a broad range of suppliers, with minimal concentration risk. Our suppliers are generally located in
the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Turkey and China. For the 2018 financial year (after giving pro
_forma effect to the Acquisitions), our top 10 suppliers accounted for approximately 18% of our total_
expenditure with third parties. We can easily pass supplier price increases to our customers, and we
maintain a low foreign currency risk profile, as only 15.0% of our cost base is incurred in foreign
currencies. We also offset currency fluctuation through our Group-wide hedging strategy; for example, we
use our local currency income first to satisfy local currency costs, and then we apply a forward-hedging
policy on the remainder. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk.’’_

Bulk purchases of a small number of raw materials such as synthetic yarn are coordinated at the Group
level, and prices of these Group-level bulk purchases are reviewed every six-to-twelve months by senior
management. We do not utilize a central purchasing department, though our operating businesses’
purchasing functions operate in accordance with a Group-defined framework. For key raw materials, we
run a competitive auction process with a range of approved suppliers.

In the case of certain raw materials, such as PU and natural gas, prices are fixed through long-term
agreements. However, we generally prefer shorter-term agreements, as the scale of our business, the
fungibility of certain key raw materials suppliers (we maintain relationships with alternative raw materials
suppliers with whom we do not currently trade) and the competitive nature of the markets for a number of
our raw materials give us significant purchasing power and leverage over our supply partners. We are
therefore able to manage third-party costs tightly while ensuring supply security through supply chain
redundancy.

We have robust in-house manufacturing capabilities, and we do not outsource a significant amount of
manufacturing operations. We, however, utilize some contract manufacturers and other manufacturers’
spare capacity on a small scale to balance our own carpet and ceramic manufacturing capacity and cost,
and to increase manufacturing flexibility.

For certain smaller product segments of our offering, commercial sense requires that we outsource the full
production. For example, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) is considerably easier than other flooring products to
transport and warehouse, and there is a well-established and cost-effective manufacturing base in Asia.

**_Production_**

Our core manufacturing activities are centered around three product segments: carpet, ceramic tile and
flooring underlay. Manufacturing processes between these products differ significantly. For example, our
tufted carpet manufacturing process begins with yarn extrusion (extraction of yarn filaments from synthetic
granulates). The resulting yarn filaments are then dyed and spun, set up on beams and creels, and finally
tufted, backed and cut. Our ceramic tiles are milled from raw materials, pressed, then dried and glazed.
After rolling into shape, the tiles are fired in a kiln before being cut into squares. Our PU underlay
manufacturing begins with the manufacture of PU foam and subsequent exposure to binding agents. Once
bonded under high-pressure steam, the underlay is dried, peeled, laminated and cut. Rubber underlay is

128


-----

manufactured by combining manufacturing liquids and powdered rubber, extruding and rolling flat the
resulting putty, then baking in a ‘‘heat-setting’’ process before cutting the final product into shape.

We have robust in-house manufacturing capabilities and we do not outsource a significant portion of our
manufacturing. Broadloom tufted carpets, one of our key carpeting products, are large and heavy, difficult
to manufacture in short runs and because they are large and non-palletized, they are difficult to transport
over long distances and relatively easy to damage. Ceramic tiles generally are similarly heavy and difficult
to transport. These factors represent significant barriers to entry for low-cost international imports and are
why the vast majority of carpet and ceramic flooring in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe is
produced by locally-based manufacturers. The location of our production facilities in the United Kingdom
and in the center of Continental Europe in close proximity to our key United Kingdom and Continental
European end-markets is a key competitive advantage, helping to minimize end-product transportation
costs and delivery lead times to these markets. In certain instances, we also utilize contract manufacturers
and other manufacturers’ spare capacity on a small scale to balance our own carpet and ceramic
manufacturing capacity and cost, and to increase manufacturing flexibility.

Most individual steps in our manufacturing processes across all our manufactured products are modular,
such that multiple processes for the same product can be run simultaneously—we are therefore rarely
limited by manufacturing infrastructure bottlenecks. Outsourcing is occasionally utilized in parts of the
production process (for example, in the yarn extrusion process) to provide manufacturing flexibility and
downside protection.

For certain smaller product segments, there is a strong commercial rationale for fully outsourcing our
production. For example, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) can be palletized and is therefore considerably easier than
other flooring products to transport and warehouse, with a well-established and cost-effective
manufacturing base in Asia.

Our manufacturing activities are spread across 12 factories (five in the United Kingdom, three in
Continental Europe and four in Australia). In the 2018 financial year, we consolidated our United
Kingdom carpet manufacturing at our Yorkshire and South Wales factories while closing our
Kidderminster factory as well as insourcing certain production. We recently announced a similar initiative
in Australia, which will result in the consolidation of our two underlay factories into a single, enlarged
facility.

The following table sets forth the number, production area, production capacity and ownership status of
our production facilities.

For those facilities that we lease, the lease terms are between one and eighteen years remaining. Our total
property, plant and equipment amounted to £179.5 million as at June 30, 2018.

Our carpeting products are manufactured in Newport, South Wales; Cleckheaton, Yorkshire; and
Melbourne, Australia.

Our flooring underlay and flooring accessories are produced in Rossendale, Lancashire; Keighley,
Yorkshire; Melbourne, Australia; and Sydney, Australia.

Our artificial grass products are designed and specified in Dutch facilities in Aalten, Netherlands.

Our ceramic products are produced in our facilities in Castell´on, Spain and Sassuolo, Italy.

**Warehousing and Distribution**

We operate a total of 31 warehouses with a combined warehousing capacity of over 25 million square
meters, of which approximately 35%, 45% and 20% are dedicated to carpeting, ceramics and underlay,
respectively. Our in-house warehousing capability is a competitive advantage, and is a barrier to entry for
future potential competition. By holding stock for certain products on our customers’ behalf, and by

129


-----

subsequently delivering upon receipt of orders, we benefit from real-time market data and feedback while
limiting our de-stocking risk. This service is a core part of our customer offering, and a key structural
strength. The combination of our stocking services with our design and manufacturing capabilities results
in vertical integration that differentiates us from much of our competition.

In general, stock management, warehousing and transport differ by product segment.

Among our product offering, broadloom carpet is the most complex to distribute. As a result of the size
and weight of broadloom carpets, and the equipment required to cut them into end-product sizes, many
independent retailers are not able to hold stock. For these customers, the Group often holds stock on their
behalf, while the customer retains Group-branded display stands and samples in-store. Our sales teams are
subsequently provided a summary of end-consumer orders which are then cut from ‘‘mother rolls’’ in our
distribution centers, wrapped and delivered in-store. Typical stock turn in our carpet distribution centers is
approximately three times per year.

Ceramic tiles are also stocked to meet ongoing customer demand, but without the need for any further
processing (e.g. cutting) as with broadloom carpets. Similar to our carpet offering, specialist retail
customer deliveries follow from in-store consumer orders based on samples we provide. Ceramics,
however, have a larger wholesale market and are also sold for use in the DIY market—these retailers are
able to hold stock and are suited to bulk delivery. Given the structure of the Continental European
ceramic tile production market (with producers concentrated in Spain and Italy), customers arrange
transport rather than manufactures. Typical stock turn is approximately three-to-four times a year for
specialist retailers and nine-to-ten times a year for DIY retailers.

Underlay is more commonly sold through distributors and large-chain retailers. As a result, inventory
turnover of finished goods is greater, and deliveries tend to be in bulk, direct from the factory warehouse
to customer warehouses. These products come in standard widths of four-meter rolls, and are much lighter
and easier to handle than carpets or ceramics. Typical stock turn is approximately ten times a year.

Our objectives when we transport our products include maintaining our on-time delivery record while
managing transportation costs. Some of our subsidiaries own their own transport infrastructure, with the
Group operating a fleet of approximately 350 goods vehicles. Additionally, some subsidiaries utilize thirdparty service providers to transport products from our production facilities to the relevant warehouse or
distribution center, as well as to our customers and end-consumers.

In 2017, we began the reorganization of our United Kingdom logistics operations to improve productivity
and customer service. This process included the ongoing relocation of our distribution center in the
Midlands to our Kidderminster site. We anticipate that further efficiency gains will be made from the
completed opening of our Southern Distribution Center in Hemel Hempstead, England, servicing all of
our brands, and the potential for a further new distribution center in northern England.

We distribute our products globally, with sales in over 20 countries in the 2018 financial year.

**Employees**

During the 2018 financial year, we had an average headcount for the year of 2,500 employees. 84.4% of our
employees were based in the UK & Europe, with 15.6% in Australia. The following table sets forth total
average employee headcount for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years.

**For the financial year**

We consider our relations with our employees to be good. The terms and conditions for employees,
including working hours, termination rights and benefits, are governed by standard employee contracts
together with, in certain circumstances, a variety of collective bargaining agreements.

**Insurance**

We have insurance policies in place that cover liability for public and product liability, death or injury to
employees and damage to property, including buildings, plants, machinery and stock. We also have
insurance coverage for business interruption.

130


-----

We work closely with our insurance brokers to ensure that we maintain policies that are suitable for our
business and industry. However, our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our
business. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business—Significant damage to any of
_our facilities could cause a production disruption.’’_

**Information Technology and Data**

Our IT platform is used to manage our operations, including design software, production, purchasing,
sales, customer service, logistics and administration. For many of our operating businesses, we have a
complex and heterogeneous application landscape that in part consists of partially integrated systems from
prior acquisitions. We support our IT systems through an in-house team of IT specialists. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business—A failure of, or a malicious attack in relation to,_
_our IT systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.’’_

We have taken appropriate measures to secure our systems and data by using standard IT security
capability products. We have centralized backup data storage facilities as well as business continuity plans
in place. We have not experienced any significant IT problems in recent years.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are subject to legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business.
We believe that none of the legal, administrative or regulatory proceedings pending against us or with
which we are threatened, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

**Environmental and Health and Safety**

In connection with our business, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in each of the
countries where we do business. These laws and regulations impose binding standards, in particular with
respect to product safety, air pollution, carbon emissions, noise reduction, waste water, industrial waste,
and may impose specific methods for eliminating wastes, or environmental clean-up. Many of these areas
of regulation are subject to increasingly stricter levels of security and compliance, in particular relating to
carbon emissions. Due to our handling of certain chemicals, we are also subject to safety and security
requirements pursuant to various national security regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we
operate. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business—We are required to comply with
_environmental and other regulations and obtain government permits and approvals.’’_

**Regulation of Our Business**

We comply with a large number of regulations, standards and certifications in the various markets in which
we operate. These standards vary depending on the geographic region, the type of building in which a
product is installed and the type of flooring. We have adopted a monitoring process to ensure that our
products are in material compliance with all applicable regulations, standards and certifications.

**_Regulatory Matters_**

We are subject to a number of EU and local regulations in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and
Australia, which range in scope from the communication on chemicals in the supply chain to the labeling of
fiber compositions, the evaluation of textile fiber mixtures, restrictions of use and authorization of
chemicals used during our production cycle.

**_Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Standards_**

We are subject to two types of standards: mandatory standards based on legal requirements, and
non-mandatory standards that we have chosen to comply with to respond to our customers’ needs.

In most cases, compliance with mandatory standards must be certified by independent laboratories and/or
organizations as well as by a governmental authority. Their principal objective is to ensure the safety and
protect the health of end-market users by demonstrating that the product complies with regulatory
requirements, which relate primarily to fire-resistance, slip-resistance and limits on toxic fumes.

Non-mandatory standards are primarily testing standards to determine a product’s technical characteristics
such as acoustic properties or dimensional stability, and specifications relating to minimum thresholds for a

131


-----

specific use. These standards vary depending on the product and its intended use, such as schools, hospitals
or homes. These standards allow buyers, decision-makers and end-market users to be informed of the
characteristics of our flooring in order to better differentiate between our products and those of our
competitors. The technical specifications that we choose to communicate vary depending on the
requirements of the market in question.

Especially in the commercial market, customers often stipulate compliance with non-mandatory standards
in their order specifications. Moreover, compliance with non-mandatory standards is also required by
certain national or municipal governments for the construction or renovation of buildings that will be used
as public administrations or government agencies.

**_Standard Organizations and Standards Used in Other Jurisdictions_**

Standard organizations define the technical characteristics and performance that a product must meet, as
well as the tests to be used.

At the international level, the principal organization in charge of publishing our applicable standards is the
International Organization for Standardization (‘‘ISO’’). Compliance with ISO standards is based on the
principles developed by the World Trade Organization, and is technically voluntary, although often
required by architects and contractors, in particular for government contractors. Furthermore, agreements
between ISO and the European Union enable the transposition of an ISO standard into a European
standard.

In Europe, standards are established by the European Committee for Standardization (‘‘CEN’’). These
standards, called ‘‘EN’’ standards, are mandatory when referenced by a European regulation.

European directives also define requirements for each product. ‘‘Harmonized’’ EN standards may be
either mandatory or optional. They concern the health and safety of end-market users as well as energy
savings. If a product is shown to comply with certain harmonized standards, it is automatically deemed to
comply with requirements under European directives.

Compliance with harmonized standards enables a manufacturer to obtain the ‘‘CE’’ label, governed by
Regulation (EC) No. 305/2011 of April 24, 2011, which came into effect on July 1, 2013. We market our
products in Europe under this label. The CE label indicates that we certify that the product complies with
the various harmonized standards and that the flooring has undergone adequate testing. Among the
mandatory harmonized standards, fire-retardant and fire-resistance standards, anti-slip standards and toxic
emissions standards are the most important. For example, we comply with EN Standard 14041, which
details requirements for resilient and laminate hard flooring and carpets.

In addition, we can be required to comply with standards issued by national organizations in various
European Union member states. We are subject to national standards in the countries where we sell our
products.

Countries such as Australia, also develop standards as well as national regulations with which we may be

**_Long-term Management Incentive Plan_**

On April 10, 2017, the Board announced a long-term management incentive plan (the ‘‘Plan’’) in order to
enable the Board to continue to incentivize senior employees in a manner closely aligned with the interests
of the Company’s shareholders.

The Plan involves the issue of up to 100,000 non-voting shares in Victoria Midco Holdings Limited, a
subsidiary of the Company. Participants in the Plan will subscribe for these shares. The initial award of
shares (the ‘‘Incentive Shares’’) represented only a proportion (approximately 72%) of the total number of
shares created, with the balance being reserved for potential future awards to additional employees. The
Plan will operate for a five year period, with the value of the Incentive Shares linked to cumulative Total
Shareholder Return (‘‘TSR’’) delivered each year above a hurdle, being the current market capitalization
of the Company increased annually by 20% per annum on a compounding basis (i.e. within each annual
period shareholders have to receive a return of 20% before the participants benefit from the Plan). TSR is
equal to the change in market capitalization of the Company plus dividends or return of capital to
shareholders, if any.

At the end of the Plan, the Incentive Shares can be exchanged for new ordinary shares in Victoria PLC (at
the then prevailing share price averaged over the month prior to exchange). Participants can only choose to
exchange at the end of the full five-year period of the Plan. Customary good and bad leaver provisions will
apply. The participants will have no right to any payment of cash. For further information, see Note 5 to
the 2018 Group Financial Statements.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

From time to time, we may enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates and in the
ordinary course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the
related parties or our affiliates than what they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third-parties.

Director for the Midlands. On September 30, 2014, Victoria PLC entered into a loan facility with BGF

annual fee of £35,000 which is commensurate with that paid to our other Non-executive Directors. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—BGF Loan.’’

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain of our future significant debt arrangements. The following
summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
underlying documents. The defined terms set forth in this section apply to this section only.

**The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_New Revolving Credit Facility_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will become effective on satisfaction of all conditions precedent under
the amendment and restatement agreement pursuant to which the Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement is established. The New Revolving Credit Facility, which will be available to be
drawn in Sterling, Euro or Australian Dollars (together with other currencies to be agreed by all lenders
party to the relevant facility), is in a principal amount of £60,000,000. Any amounts drawn under the New
Revolving Credit Facility will be permitted to be used for the general corporate and working capital
purposes of the Victoria Group (including, without limitation, the financing of acquisitions permitted
under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The New Revolving Credit
Facility may be utilized by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of letters of credit and/or the
establishment of ancillary facilities with lenders on a bi-lateral basis.

The initial borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be the Issuer.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other
permissions under the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against
the limitation on indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness under one or more uncommitted
additional facilities within the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement up to an
aggregate amount of the greater of £75,000,000 and 67% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the
section entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes’’).

**_Interest and Fees_**

The initial rate of interest on each utilization under the New Revolving Credit Facility for each interest
period will be the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of: (a) the applicable margin (subject
to a decreasing margin ratchet provision calculated on the basis of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio,
as defined in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes’’); and (b) LIBOR (or, where applicable to loans
in Euro, EURIBOR and in Australian Dollars, BBSY). The Borrower to which a loan has been made shall
pay accrued interest on that loan on the last day of each interest period. A commitment fee is also payable
on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility subject to the
terms and conditions set out therein.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Maturity_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility shall be repaid in full on the date falling 6 months prior to the original
maturity of the Notes.

**_Conditions to borrowing_**

Utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Prepayment_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a £1,000,000 de minimis).
Mandatory prepayments of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be required to be made upon the
purchase or redemption of the Notes in certain circumstances. The New Revolving Credit Facility also
requires the mandatory prepayment by the Issuer of all amounts due to a lender under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, in certain circumstances detailed therein, upon a Change of Control or a sale of all or in
respect of substantially all of the assets of the Victoria Group.

138


-----

**_Undertakings and covenants_**

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain certain incurrence covenants
that are substantially similar to those in the Indenture governing the Notes.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will also require each obligor to observe
certain affirmative undertakings subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions. These
affirmative undertakings will include, but will not be limited to, undertakings related to (i) compliance with
relevant laws, rules and regulations (including environmental), (ii) payment of taxes, (iii) the delivery of
annual budgets, (iv) notice of default, (v) the maintenance of and funding of pension schemes,
(vi) maintenance of assets and (vii) compliance with and maintenance of material authorizations. There
will also be an affirmative undertaking in relation to guarantor coverage (by reference to 80% of
Consolidated EBITDA, subject to certain exceptions.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will also require us to ensure compliance
with a financial covenant relating to total net leverage in respect of each relevant 12-month period ending
on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September or 31 December (each a ‘‘Quarter Date’’) not exceeding an agreed
level. The financial covenant will be tested on any Quarter Date on which utilizations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility are equal to or greater than 35% of the total commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility (including any additional facility).

The Company will be permitted to remedy any breach of the financial covenant by applying all or any part
of amounts received by the Company in cash pursuant to any new equity or capital contributions (such
amount being a cure amount) be included in the calculation of the total net leverage by deducting such
amounts from the calculation of consolidated net debt. No more than two cure amounts may be taken into
account during the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility or in consecutive financial quarters.

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a ‘‘notes purchase
condition’’ covenant which provides that subject to certain exceptions set out in the Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer shall not, and shall procure that each member of
the Victoria Group will not, repay, prepay, purchase, defease or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) any
Notes or any ‘‘Permitted Refinancing Debt’’ (as defined in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes’’)
(each such prepayment, purchase, defeasance and redemption a ‘‘Notes Purchase’’) prior to their
scheduled repayment date. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments that
either (i) the aggregate principal face value amount of all Notes and/or Permitted Refinancing Debt that
are the subject of Notes Purchases do not exceed 50% of the aggregate of the original aggregate principal
face value amount of the Notes as at the Issue Date (the ‘‘Notes Purchase Basket’’), or (ii) to the extent
the aggregate principal face value amount of all Notes and/or Permitted Refinancing Debt that are the
subject of Notes Purchases has (or would) exceed the Notes Purchase Basket, the Issuer shall ensure that
an amount of the commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility are cancelled and, if applicable,
utilizations are prepaid (as the Issuer may select in its sole discretion) in the same proportion by which the
Notes and/or Permitted Refinancing Debt in excess of the Notes Purchase Basket are repaid, prepaid,
purchased, defeased or redeemed (or otherwise retired for value) until the commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility (and any additional facility established under the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) have been reduced to zero.

**_Events of default_**

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will set out certain events of default in
relation to the New Revolving Credit Facility that are substantially similar to those in the Indenture
governing the Notes. In addition, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
contain other customary events of default, subject to certain agreed exceptions, including (i) cessation of
business, (ii) misrepresentation, (iii) breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) an event of default under
certain other loan documents with BGF Investments LP subject to a £2,500,000 de minimis, and
(v) expropriation. The occurrence of an event of default will, subject to any applicable grace periods and
cure rights, allow the lenders under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to
accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments.

**_Security, guarantee and indemnity_**

It is intended that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same Collateral as for the Notes
as set out under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security.’’.

139


-----

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral will be
applied to repayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility in priority to repayment of the Notes.

The provision and the terms of the Collateral will in all cases be subject to certain limitations and are at all
times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set out in the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Please see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’._

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be initially guaranteed by Victoria PLC and Victoria Midco
Holdings Limited, each a ‘‘Guarantor.’’

**_Governing law_**

The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with English law, although the incurrence covenants and certain events of default
contained therein, which largely replicate the relevant covenants and events of default from the Notes,
shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

Save as set out below, so long as any of the Super Senior Liabilities (other than any liabilities owed to the
lenders who make an ancillary facility available pursuant to the terms of a Credit Facilities Agreement or
Pari Passu Facility Agreement (the ‘‘Ancillary Lenders’’)) are or may be outstanding, none of the Ancillary
Lenders shall be entitled to take any enforcement action in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it.

_Permitted Enforcement: Ancillary Lenders_

Each Ancillary Lender may take enforcement action if (i) at the same time as that action, enforcement
action has been taken in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities in which case the Ancillary Lenders may
take the same enforcement action; (ii) that action is contemplated by the Credit Facility Agreement or the
terms of the relevant section of the Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) that enforcement action is taken in

Save as set out below in ‘‘—Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties,’’ or ‘‘—Required
Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties’’ (and without prejudice to the Hedge Counterparties’ rights set out
below in ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’), the Hedge Counterparties shall not take any enforcement action
in respect of any of the Hedging Liabilities or any of the hedging transactions under any of the Hedging
Agreements at any time.

_Permitted Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging
Agreement, a Hedge Counterparty may terminate or close-out in whole or in part any hedging transaction
under that Hedging Agreement prior to its stated maturity: (i) if, prior to a Distress Event, the Issuer has
certified to the Hedge Counterparty that that termination or close-out would not result in a breach of a
Credit Facility Document, a Pari Passu Debt Document or a Second Lien Document; (ii) if a hedging force
majeure has occurred in respect of that Hedging Agreement; (iii) if the Hedge Counterparty and the
relevant Debtor consensually agree to terminate, reduce or close-out in whole or in part a transaction
under a Hedging Agreement and no Default is continuing under any Credit Facility Document, Pari Passu
Debt Document or Second Lien Document, or would result from such termination, reduction or close-out;
(iv) if a Distress Event has occurred; (v) if an insolvency related Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any equivalent
provision of a Debt Document) in relation to a Debtor which is party to that Hedging Agreement; and

notice or grace periods) and the default has continued unwaived for more than 15 Business Days after

145


-----

notice of that default has been given to the Security Agent, the relevant Hedge Counterparty (i) may, to
the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement, terminate or close-out in whole or in
part any hedging transaction under that Hedging Agreement; and (ii) until such time as the Security Agent
has given notice to that Hedge Counterparty that the Transaction Security is being enforced (or that any
formal steps are being taken to enforce the Transaction Security), shall be entitled to exercise any right it
might otherwise have to sue for, commence or join legal or arbitration proceedings against any Debtor to
recover any Hedging Liabilities due under that Hedging Agreement.

_Required Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, save in circumstances where an Acceleration Event has

stated maturity, following: (i) the occurrence of an Acceleration Event and delivery to it of a notice from
the Security Agent that that Acceleration Event has occurred; and (ii) delivery to it of a subsequent notice
from the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group) instructing it to do so.

If a Hedge Counterparty is entitled to terminate or close-out any transaction as described in ‘‘—Permitted
Enforcement: Hedge Counterparties’’ above, (or would have been able to if that Hedge Counterparty had
given the notice referred to in that section) but has not terminated or closed out each such transaction,
that Hedge Counterparty shall promptly terminate or close-out in full each such hedging transaction
following a request to do so by the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group).

_Restrictions on Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors_

Save as set out below in ‘‘—Permitted Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors’’ and except with the prior
consent of or as required by the Instructing Group, (i) no Second Lien Creditor shall take or require the

any time prior to the Final Discharge Date.

146


-----

_Permitted Enforcement: Intra-Group Lenders_

After the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor grantor of Transaction Security, each
Intra Group Lender may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has
taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra-Group Lender in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), exercise any right it may otherwise have against that
member of the Group to: (a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Intra-Group Liabilities or
declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on demand; (b) make a demand under any
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member of the Group in respect of any
Intra-Group Liabilities; (c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any

**_Enforcement of Transaction Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction
Security or taking any other enforcement action unless instructed otherwise by either the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors whichever at the relevant time is entitled to give
instructions (the ‘‘Senior Secured Instructing Group’’) or, (in certain circumstances) the Creditor
Representative in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second
Lien Creditors), (each an ‘‘Instructing Group’’).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and (i) subject
to ‘‘—Enforcement Decisions’’ below, (A) a Senior Secured Instructing Group; (B) to the extent permitted
to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Transaction Security prior to the later of the Credit Facility
Lender Discharge Date and the Pari Passu Discharge Date as set out in ‘‘—Permitted Enforcement:
Second Lien Creditors,’’ the Creditor Representative in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors); or (C) upon the later of the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date and the Pari Passu Discharge Date, the Creditor Representative in respect of Second Lien
Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), may give or refrain from
giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security as
they see fit provided that the instructions as to Enforcement given by the Instructing Group are consistent
with the Enforcement Principles.

Prior to the later of the Credit Facility Discharge Date, and the Pari Passu Discharge Date: (i) if the Senior
Secured Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the
Transaction Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the Senior Secured Instructing Group, and,
in each case, the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed
Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which
the Credit Representative in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Creditors) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as set out in ‘‘—Permitted
Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors’’ above.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the Creditor Representative for the Credit Facility
Lenders or the Pari Passu Debt Representatives are then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to
enforce the Transaction Security and the Creditor Representative in respect of any Majority Second Lien
Creditors either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then any of the
Creditor Representative for the Credit Facility Lenders, the Pari Passu Noteholders or Pari Passu Lenders
may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Creditor
Representative for the Credit Facility Lenders or the Pari Passu Noteholders or Pari Passu Lenders see fit
in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Creditor Representative in respect of any Majority
Second Lien Creditors as set out in ‘‘—Permitted Enforcement: Second Lien Creditors’’ above respectively
and the Security Agent shall act on the instructions received from such of the Creditor Representative for
the Credit Facility Lenders, the Pari Passu Noteholders or Pari Passu Lenders as is then entitled to give
instructions as set out in ‘‘—Enforcement Decisions’’ below provided that such instructions are consistent
with the security enforcement principles.

‘‘Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date’’ means the first date on which all Credit Facility Liabilities have
been fully and finally discharged to the satisfaction of the relevant Creditor Representative, whether or not

147


-----

as the result of an enforcement, and the Credit Facility Lenders are under no further obligation to provide
financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under the Debt Documents.

‘‘Pari Passu Discharge Date’’ means the first date on which all Pari Passu Liabilities have been fully and
finally discharged to the satisfaction of the relevant Creditor Representatives (in the case of Pari Passu
Debt Liabilities) and each Pari Passu Hedge Counterparty (in the case of its Pari Passu Hedging
Liabilities), whether or not as the result of an enforcement, and the Paris Passu Creditors are under no
further obligation to provide financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under the Debt Documents.

‘‘Majority Pari Passu Creditors’’ means, at any time, those Pari Passu Creditors whose pari passu credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total pari passu credit participations at
that time, after excluded commitments and disenfranchisements of defaulting lenders have been taken into
account.

‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’ means such of the Super Senior Creditors whose super senior credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 66.67 per cent. of the total super senior credit
participations at that time, after excluded commitments and disenfranchisements of defaulting lenders
have been taken into account.

‘‘Majority Second Lien Creditors’’ means such of the Second Lien Creditors whose second lien credit
participations at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total second lien credit participations at
that time, after excluded commitments and disenfranchisements of defaulting lenders have been taken into
account.

‘‘Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’ means those Hedging Liabilities owed to a Hedge Counterparty
pursuant to a Hedging Agreement permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Credit Facility
Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Second Lien Documents which have been designated
(and such designation has not been released) as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security is being enforced as set out in ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’ above, the
Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security or take other action as to Enforcement in such
manner (including the selection of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any
Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as: (a) a Senior Secured Instructing Group; (b) prior to the
Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date and the Pari Passu Discharge Date, if: (i) the Security Agent has,
pursuant to ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’ above, received instructions given by the Creditor
Representative in respect of the Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce the Transaction Security; and
(ii) the Senior Secured Instructing Group (or other Pari Passu Creditors pursuant ‘‘—Enforcement
Instructions’’ above) has not given instructions as to the manner of the enforcement of the Transaction
Security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors, shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as
the Security Agent sees fit, in each case, so far as is consistent with the Enforcement Principles. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, the Security Agent will not
be required to take any action.

_Enforcement Decisions_

Prior to the later to occur of the of the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Pari Passu Discharge
Date, and the date on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (with no
obligation to provide financial accommodation to the Debtors under the Second Lien Documents) (the
‘‘Final Discharge Date’’) and save as set out below, before the giving of any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the Transaction Security pursuant to ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’ (and before either
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors shall be considered the
Instructing Group), a Creditor Representative for the Credit Facility Lenders will or the Creditor
Representative for each of the Pari Passu Creditors shall deliver a copy of its proposed enforcement
instructions to the other Creditor Representatives and the Security Agent (which shall, for the avoidance
of doubt, include instructions not to enforce) (the ‘‘Proposed Enforcement Instructions’’). The Security
Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify each of the Creditor Representatives of the Super
Senior Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement Instructions.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date and save as set out below, if the Security Agent has received any
Proposed Enforcement Instruction, it shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction

148


-----

Security in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (and the Majority Pari
Passu Creditors shall be the Instructing Group for the purposes of ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’ and in
each case, acting through their respective Creditor Representative), provided that such instructions are
consistent with the Enforcement Principles and failure to give instructions will be deemed to be an
instruction not to take Enforcement steps.

In the event that (i) from the date that is three (3) months after the first Proposed Enforcement
Instructions (including such instructions not to take Enforcement steps) are delivered to the Security
Agent, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Pari Passu Creditors) has not
commenced the Enforcement Action or Relevant Enforcement Action (as defined below) of the
Transaction Security ; or (ii) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash
within six (6) months of the date the first Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including such instructions
not to take enforcement steps) were delivered to such Security Agent, then (with effect from the date of
the earlier to occur of such events), the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall become the Instructing
Group as set out in ‘‘—Enforcement Instructions’’ above.

If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the Transaction
Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
a Creditor Representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari
Passu Creditors, as the case may be, may at any time provide immediate instructions as to Enforcement to
the Security Agent notwithstanding any instructions given as set out above, if the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors determine in good faith (and notify the Creditor
Representatives of the other Super Senior Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors and the Second Lien
Creditors and the Security Agent) the delay in taking enforcement action of the Transaction Security could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on: (i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security; or (ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security, and
the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of the
determination set out above, in accordance with the first such notice of determination and instructions as
to Enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in each case that such instructions are consistent
with the Enforcement Principles).

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor (other than an insolvency event
which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors), the Security Agent shall act, to the
extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with such
instructions, provided that in the event the Security Agent has previously received Proposed Enforcement
Instructions from the Creditor Representative for the Majority Pari Passu Creditors and has commenced
Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent shall continue to act in
accordance with the instructions of the Creditor Representative for the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
until such time as the Creditor Representatives for Majority Super Senior Creditors issue enforcement
instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such prior
instructions given by the Creditor Representative for the Majority Pari Passu Creditors.

Other than as set out above, if, prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, the Majority Pari Passu Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (in each case
acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Security in a manner which is not
consistent with the Enforcement Principles, the Creditor Representatives for the Super Senior Creditors,
the Pari Passu Debt Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors or the Pari Passu Notes Trustee shall give notice
to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Second
Lien Creditors and the Pari Passu Notes Trustee (as appropriate) after which the Creditor Representatives
for the other Super Senior Creditors, Pari Passu Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Pari Passu
Notes Trustee shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the
relevant Creditor Representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of Enforcement
provided that such Creditor Representatives shall not be obliged to consult under this section more than
once in relation to each enforcement action.

After the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors.

149


-----

For the purposes of this section, ‘‘Relevant Enforcement Action’’ means either (i) the determination by the
Instructing Group of the method of enforcement of Transaction Security or (ii) the appointment of a
financial advisor (as defined below) by the Instructing Group to assist in such determination.

_Enforcement Principles_

The Instructing Group may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with certain security
enforcement principles of maximizing, to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of
value, the value realized from enforcement (the ‘‘Enforcement Principles’’), including that:

(a) in this section, ‘‘Secured Parties’’ means the Super Senior Creditors, the Pari Passu Creditors, the
Creditor Representatives, the arrangers of any Credit Facility, the Security Agent, the delegates of the
Security Agent and any receiver;

(b) the Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that
either:

(i) all proceeds or enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’
below: or

(ii) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure
that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (please see
‘‘Application of Proceeds’’ below), the Super Senior Discharge Date will occur (unless the
Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(c) On a proposed enforcement action:

(i) over assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate book value of such
assets exceeds A5,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists,

which, in either case, is not being effected through a public auction, the Security Agent shall, if
requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, appoint a
financial adviser to provide a fairness opinion in relation to that Enforcement, provided that the
Security Agent shall not be required to appoint a financial adviser nor obtain a fairness opinion if
a proposed enforcement:

(i) would result in the receipt of sufficient enforcement proceeds in cash by the Security Agent
to ensure that, after application in accordance with ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below:

(A) in the case of an enforcement requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the
Final Discharge Date would occur; or

(B) in the case of an Enforcement requested by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, the Super
Senior Discharge Date would occur;

(ii) is in accordance with any applicable law; and

(iii) complies with ‘‘—Distressed Disposals’’.

(e) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a financial advisor or to seek the advice of
a financial advisor, unless expressly required to do so by any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) the fairness opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other
enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after
taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the maximum value
realised from enforcement (to the extent consistent with a prompt and expedition realization of value)
has been met;

(g) in the absence of written notice from a Secured Party or group of Secured Parties, that such Secured
Party(s) object to any enforcement of any Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement
Action does not aim to achieve the Enforcement Objective, the Security Agent is entitled to assume
that such enforcement of any Transaction Security is in accordance with the Enforcement Objective;
and

150


-----

(h) if the Security Agent is unable to obtain a fairness opinion after attempting to do so (and after
considering making such modifications to the enforcement process as may be reasonably available and
consistent with the Enforcement Principles to obtain such opinion) because such opinions are not
generally available in the market in such circumstances it shall notify each Creditor Representative
and may proceed to enforce any Transaction Security without needing to demonstrate (by way of a
fairness opinion or otherwise) that such enforcement is aiming to achieve the Enforcement Objective.

**_Second Lien Payment Stop Notice_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, until the Senior Discharge Date, (except with the prior
consent of the Creditor Representatives in respect of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu
Debt Documents), and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer shall procure that
no member of the Group shall make, and no Second Lien Creditor may receive from any member of the
Group, any payment permitted pursuant to the following section above ‘‘—Permitted Payments: Second
Lien Liabilities’’ (other than Second Lien Representative Amounts) if: (i) a Senior Payment Default has
occurred and is continuing; or (ii) a Secured Debt Event of Default (other than a Senior Payment Default)
has occurred and is continuing, from the date on which the Creditor Representatives in respect of the
Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as the case may be) (the ‘‘Relevant
Representative’’) delivers a notice (a ‘‘Second Lien Payment Stop Notice’’) specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to that Event of Default under (and as defined in) (a) the Credit Facility
Agreements, (b) the Pari Passu Notes Indenture, (c) any Pari Passu Debt Documents, or (d) any Second
Lien Documents (each a ‘‘Secured Debt Event of Default’’) to the Security Agent and the Creditor
Representative in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities until the earliest of: (A) the date falling 179 days
after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; (B) the date on which an ‘‘Event of Default’’ as
defined in the Second Lien Documents (a ‘‘Second Lien Default’’) occurs for failure to pay principal at the
original scheduled maturity of the Second Lien Liabilities; (C) in relation to payments of Second Lien
Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period is in effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Second Lien Standstill Period expires; (D) the date on which
the relevant Secured Debt Event of Default is no longer continuing and, if the relevant Liabilities have
been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded; (E) the date on which the Relevant Representative
delivers a notice to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representative in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; (F) the later of the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date and the Pari Passu Discharge Date; and (G) the date on which the Creditor
Representative in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities takes any enforcement action that it is permitted
to take under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless the Creditor Representative in respect of Second Lien Liabilities waives this requirement: (i) a new
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the
delivery of the immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Secured Debt Event of Default more than 90 days after the date
the Creditor Representatives in respect of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents (as applicable) received notice of that Secured Debt Event of Default.

The Creditor Representatives in respect of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents may serve only one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances. Subject to the provisions set out above, this shall not affect the right of the Creditor
Representatives in respect of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents to issue a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by the Creditor Representatives in respect of the
Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents in respect of a Secured Debt Event of
Default which had been notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice was issued.

_Cure of Second Lien Stop Notice_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if: (a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases
to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and
(b) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any payments
which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have been a payment

151


-----

permitted pursuant to the following section above ‘‘—Permitted Payments: Second Lien Liabilities’’ but for
that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default, then any Event of Default which may
have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Second Lien
Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in
each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien Creditors.

**_Second Lien Standstill Period_**

In relation to a relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the
period beginning on the date (the ‘‘Second Lien Standstill Start Date’’) the Creditor Representative in
respect of the Second Lien Liabilities serves an enforcement notice on the Credit Facility Agent, the Pari
Passu Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative in respect of such Relevant Second Lien Default
and ending on the earlier to occur of: (a) the date falling 179 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start
Date (the ‘‘Second Lien Standstill Period’’); (b) the date the Secured Parties take any enforcement action
in relation to a Guarantor, provided however, that: (i) if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends, the Second
Lien Creditors may only take the same enforcement action in relation to the Guarantor as the enforcement
action taken by the Secured Parties against such Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Group; and (ii) Enforcement Action shall not include action taken to preserve or protect any Security as
opposed to realize it; (c) the date of an insolvency event in relation to a Guarantor against whom
enforcement action is to be taken; (d) the date on which a Second Lien Default occurs for failure to pay
principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Second Lien Debt; (e) the date on which the Creditor
Representatives in respect of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as
applicable) consent to an enforcement in respect of the Relevant Second Lien Default by the relevant
Second Lien Creditor; and (f) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date
such first mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a
cure, waiver or other permitted remedy).

The Second Lien Creditors may take enforcement action as described above even if, at the end of any
relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has
begun as a result of any other Relevant Second Lien Default.

If the Security Agent has notified the relevant Creditor Representative in respect of Second Lien
Liabilities that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any Transaction Security Document over shares
of a Guarantor, no Second Lien Creditor may take any action referred to above against that Guarantor
while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of the
Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the
amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Second Lien Creditors (the ‘‘Purchasing Second Lien
Creditors’’) may, after an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security (each a
‘‘Distress Event’’), by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to
them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights and obligations in respect of the
Credit Facility Liabilities and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement,
provided certain requirements are met.

**_Option to Purchase: Pari Passu Debt Creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Pari Passu Debt Creditors (the ‘‘Purchasing Pari Passu
Debt Creditors’’) may, after a Distress Event and having given all Pari Passu Noteholders and Pari Passu
Lenders the opportunity to participate in such purchase, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the
Security Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the
rights and obligations in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, provided certain requirements are met.

**_Release of the Guarantees and Security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the case of a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined below)
the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (A) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim

152


-----

(relating to a Debt Document) over that asset; (B) where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a
member of the Group, to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt
Document) over the assets of that member of the Group’s property (including the shares in and assets of
any of its Subsidiaries); and (C) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security
or any claim described in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization
of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable.

If a release of Transaction Security is required (i) to effect a resignation of a Guarantor in respect of the
Initial Facilities or any equivalent provision in a Debt Document; (ii) to facilitate a receivables financing
that is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility Documents, the Second Lien Debt Documents
and the Pari Passu Debt Documents; (iii) to facilitate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer that
is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility Documents, the Second Lien Debt Documents and
the Pari Passu Debt Documents; or (iv) in connection with the solvent winding up, liquidation or
reorganization of any Subsidiary that is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility Documents,
the Second Lien Debt Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, and the Issuer certifies for the
benefit of the Security Agent that release or resignation is permitted or not prohibited under or pursuant
to the Debt Documents, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to and shall (at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any Creditor or Debtor): (i) release the Transaction Security to the extent required to facilitate such
resignation or transaction; and (ii) execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction Security
or any claim described in (i) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable or that is requested by the Issuer (acting reasonably).

In the event of a Non-Distressed Disposal, a resignation of a guarantor under the Amended and Restated
Credit Facility Agreement or any equivalent provision in a Debt Document, each release of Transaction
Security or any claim described above shall be contingent upon that Non-Distressed Disposal or
resignation being effected or the fulfilment of such conditions (as relevant), and in the event that such
Non-Distressed Disposal or resignation is not effected or the conditions for such release are not fulfilled
(as relevant), the Transaction Security or claim subject to that release shall continue in full force and effect
as if that release had not been effected.

A ‘‘Non-Distressed Disposal’’ is a disposal of an asset which is subject to the Transaction Security to a
person or persons outside the Group which (i) is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility
Documents; (ii) is permitted or not prohibited under the Pari Passu Debt Documents; (iii) is permitted or
not prohibited under the Second Lien Debt Documents and (iv) is not a Distressed Disposal.

_Distressed Disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in circumstances where a disposal by a member of the Group
of an asset subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected: (a) at the request of the Instructing
Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; (b) by enforcement of the
Transaction Security; or (c) after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a Debtor to a person or persons
which is, or are, not a member, or members, of the Group (a ‘‘Distressed Disposal’’) the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any letters of non crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (or instruct to
release): (1) that Debtor and any Subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrower,
guarantor or other liabilities; (2) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any Subsidiary of
that Debtor over any of its assets; and (3) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, or another
Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any Subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the
relevant Creditors and Debtors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any Holding Company of a Debtor,
to release (or instruct to release): (1) that Holding Company and any Subsidiary of that Holding

creditor in relation to Subordinated Liabilities, an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor over the
assets of any Subsidiary of that Holding Company, on behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtor;

(d) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
Holding Company of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part of the
liabilities (other than liabilities due to any Creditor Representative or arranger) or the Debtors’ intragroup receivables, owed by that Debtor or Holding Company or any Subsidiary of that Debtor or
Holding Company on the basis that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtors’ intra-group
receivables (the ‘‘Transferee’’) should not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of this Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or
part of those liabilities or Debtors’ intra-group receivables on behalf of the relevant Creditors and
Debtors on terms such that (notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document) the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of this
Agreement;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the Holding Company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to dispose all or any part of the liabilities (other than
liabilities due to any Creditor Representative or Arranger); or the Debtors’ intra-group receivables,
owed by that Debtor or Holding Company or any Subsidiary of that Debtor or Holding Company on
the basis that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtors’ intra-group receivables will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of this Agreement, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of (i) all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary
Creditors (other than to any Creditor Representative or Arranger); and (ii) all or part of any other
liabilities (other than liabilities owed to any Creditor Representative or Arranger) and the Debtors’
intra-group receivables, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors and Debtors;

(f) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
Holding Company of a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to
another Debtor (the ‘‘Receiving Entity’’) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any
obligations of any Subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities; or the
Debtors’ intra-group receivables, to execute and deliver any instrument or enter into any agreement
to: (i) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtors’
intra-group receivables on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and (ii) accept the
transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtors’ intragroup receivables on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtors’ intra-group receivables are to be transferred.

(g) In the case of a Distressed Disposal or debt disposal effected by or at the request of the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing
market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

In this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers only to Victoria PLC and not to any of its
Subsidiaries, except for the purposes of financial data determined on a consolidated basis. The term
‘‘Notes,’’ unless the context requires otherwise, also refers to ‘‘book entry interests’’ in the Notes, as
defined herein. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth throughout the
text or under ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’

The Issuer will issue A450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2023
(the ‘‘Notes’’) under an indenture dated on or about, 2018 (the ‘‘Indenture’’) between, among
others, the Issuer, the Guarantors, HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited, as trustee (the
‘‘Trustee’’), and Barclays Bank PLC, as security agent (the ‘‘Security Agent’’), in private transactions that
are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘Securities
Act’’). The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which A450,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this Offering (the ‘‘Initial Notes’’). We may in the future, subject to
applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes (as defined below). We will only
be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. The
Notes and any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase,
except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Notes and the Indenture. It does not,
however, restate the Notes and the Indenture in their entirety and where reference is made to a particular
provision of the Notes or the Indenture, such reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is
qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. The Indenture,
the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in the future. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees. Please see the
section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

You should read the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
because they contain additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as
a Holder of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
may be obtained from the Issuer at the address indicated under ‘‘Listing and General Information.’’ The
Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by reference to, and is not otherwise
subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) thereof.

Application has been made to admit the Notes to trading on the International Securities Market
(‘‘Exchange’’) of the London Stock Exchange. In the event that the Notes are admitted to trading on an
exchange other than the Exchange, references herein to the Exchange shall be deemed to be to the
relevant exchange upon which the Notes are listed. The Issuer can provide no assurance that this
application will be accepted. See ‘‘—Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar.’’

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

Each reference to a legal entity herein shall be deemed to include such entity’s successor in interest, unless
the context requires otherwise.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be the Issuer’s general, senior obligations, secured as set forth under ‘‘—Security’’;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s
obligations under the Senior Credit Facility Agreement;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

158


-----

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such other obligation;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do
not provide Guarantees, including obligations owed to trade creditors; and

- be guaranteed on a senior joint and several basis by the Guarantors.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the Senior
Credit Facility Agreement, (ii) other Debt incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled
to receive proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes and (iii) certain Hedging
Obligations, if any.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by each of the Initial Guarantors: Victoria Midco Holdings Limited,
Victoria Carpets Limited, Westex (Carpets) Limited, Abingdon Flooring Limited, Interfloor Limited, View
Logistics Limited, The Victoria Carpet Company Proprietary Limited, Quest Flooring Pty Ltd, Primary
Flooring Pty Ltd, Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. and Ceramica Saloni, S.A.U.

Each Guarantee will:

- be a general, senior obligation of the Guarantor that granted such Guarantee, secured as set forth
under ‘‘—Security’’;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are
not expressly contractually subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including debt under
the Senior Credit Facility Agreement;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by
property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee or the Notes; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that do not provide Guarantees, including obligations owed to trade creditors.

**_General_**

Not all of the Issuer’s direct and indirect Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer is a Holding
Company for the operating companies in the Group and is accordingly dependent on cash flows from its
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes.

As of and for the 52-weeks ended June 30, 2018, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 86.5% of our
Adjusted _Pro Forma EBITDA, 89.5% of our_ _pro forma revenue and 87.9% of our_ _pro forma total assets_
(excluding acquired intangibles and goodwill arising on consolidation). As of June 30, 2018, our direct and
indirect Subsidiaries that do not Guarantee the Notes did not have any material external financial
indebtedness outstanding.

The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and
commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will
be effectively subordinated to the claims of that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer
is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be
subordinated in right of payment to any security over the assets of the Subsidiary and any Debt of the
Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance or infringement of
capital maintenance rules under applicable law, otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or as
set out in the respective Guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its

159


-----

Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.’’ The_
validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in this Offering Memorandum under the caption ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ Under the
circumstances described below under _‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted_
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries.’’ Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee the Notes.

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be
substantial. The Indenture will permit additional Debt to be secured.

The Indenture will provide that the Security Agent and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further
consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the
provisions described under the section entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on, 2023 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The Issuer
will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of A450,000,000. Each Note will bear interest at a
rate per annum of % and interest will be payable semi-annually on and of each
year, commencing on, 2019. Interest will be payable to Holders of record on each Note in
respect of the principal amount thereof outstanding as at the Clearing System Business Day immediately
preceding the payment date, as the case may be; however, owners of beneficial interests in the Notes must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Notes and the Guarantees—The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on_
_the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.’’ If the due date for any_
payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day at the place where such payment is due to be paid,
the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount until the next succeeding Business Day at
such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of such delay. The
rights of Holders in beneficial interest of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from, and including, the original issuance date or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture,
including the covenants restricting the incurrence of Debt (as described below under ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’), the Issuer is permitted to issue one or more series of additional Notes,_
which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the following terms
which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’):

(a) the title of such Additional Notes;

(b) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(c) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(d) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which
such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates
for the determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

160


-----

(e) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(f) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(g) if other than denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(h) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ references to
‘‘Notes’’ shall be deemed to include references to the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes.
Additional Notes may also be designated to be of the same series as the Initial Notes, but only if they have
terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Initial Notes, and, for all purposes other than
U.S. federal income tax purposes, shall be deemed to form one series therewith, and references to the
‘‘Notes’’ shall be deemed to refer to the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes. In the event that any
Additional Notes are not fungible with any Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code or other securities
identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued Notes.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons and only in denominations of
A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’), and Notes sold outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’) will initially be
represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
‘‘Reg S Global Notes’’ and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’).

During the 40-day ‘‘distribution compliance period’’ (as such term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S),
book-entry interests in the Reg S Global Notes may be transferred only outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons under Regulation S or to persons whom the transferor reasonably believes are ‘‘qualified
institutional buyers’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The Notes will be subject to certain other
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

The Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and
registered in the name of the nominee of such common depositary. Ownership of interests in the Global
Note, referred to in this description as ‘‘book-entry interests,’’ will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants.

The terms of the Indenture will provide for the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in certain limited
circumstances.

See ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**Transfer**

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Issuer, the Agents and/or the Trustee may
require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and
the Issuer may require a Holder to pay any taxes or other governmental charges payable in connection with

161


-----

the transfer or exchange. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for
redemption or repurchase or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 Business Days prior to
any date on which all or any part of the Notes are to be redeemed or repurchased. The Notes will be issued
in registered form and the Holder will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. For further
information about transfer and exchange procedures, see the section titled ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form.’’_

Book-entry interests in the 144A Global Notes, or the ‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest,’’ may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of book-entry interests in the Reg S Global Note or
the ‘‘Reg S Book-Entry Interests,’’ only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S.

Book-entry interests in the Reg S Global Notes, or the ‘‘Reg S Book-Entry Interest’’ may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of book-entry interests in the 144A Global Note or the ‘‘Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests,’’ only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A) in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A.

Any book-entry interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a book-entry interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after
such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
book-entry interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

All transfers of book-entry interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by
Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. See ‘‘Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form.’’_

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, at its
office or through its agent in London, England that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that agent
will be HSBC Bank plc (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent without prior
notice to the Holders. The Issuer will make all payments in same-day funds.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the ‘‘Registrar’’) and a transfer agent (the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The
initial Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be HSBC Bank plc. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the
Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be
left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of Notes kept by the
Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as they are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the
rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and
regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders
of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or
redemption of the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax
or similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors. Under the Indenture, the Guarantors will
jointly and severally agree to guarantee the due and punctual payment of all amounts payable under the
Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest payable under the Notes.

162


-----

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the
holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer or another Subsidiary of the Issuer. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its
Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be
discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor
to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenants described under the caption
_‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or_
_Sale of Assets’’);_

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of the Guarantor (or Capital
Stock of any Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or
through a Holding Company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under the caption _‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales’’ and as a_
result of such disposition such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(3) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions
under ‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(4) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing;

(6) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(7) the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Debt,’’ the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary which_
resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes;

(9) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’; or

(10) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement, including in accordance with certain enforcement
actions taken pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or
as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee shall execute,
subject to the receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, any documents reasonably requested by
the Issuer in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee.
Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be requested by the Issuer to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases and
amendments set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any
other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**_Limitations on the value of the Guarantees_**

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations
under its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to maintenance of
share capital, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, corporate benefit, financial assistance or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and applicable to the Guarantors and their respective

163


-----

shareholders, directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
_Guarantees—Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limit validity and enforceability’’ and_
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.’’_

**_Additional Amounts_**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of
and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, assessments or similar governmental charges (collectively, ‘‘Taxes’’) imposed or levied by or on
behalf of the United Kingdom or any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized,
engaged in a business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes, or from or through which payment on
the Notes or the Guarantees is made by or on behalf of the Issuer, or any political subdivision or authority
thereof or therein, having the power to tax (each, a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is required by law. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor is required to so
withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (‘‘Additional
Amounts’’) as may be necessary so that the net amount received after such withholding or deduction will
be not less than the amount that would have been received if such Taxes had not been required to be
withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a
Holder of any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of a present or
former connection of the Holder or beneficial owner (in the case of a Note held in global form, only if
such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership or corporation) with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not
limited to, citizenship, nationality, residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent
establishment, a place of business or a place of management present or deemed present within the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than the mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the
receipt of payments under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture or the exercise or enforcement
of rights under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner (in
the case of a Note held in global form, only if such beneficial owner is reasonably identifiable) of any
Note, to comply with the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder, providing at least
30 calendar days’ notice, to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction which the Holder or such beneficial owner is legally required to satisfy, whether imposed
by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding
of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification
that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, provided that
the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to satisfy such requirements;

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to any Note or Guarantee;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is
required in order to receive payment) by the Holder for payment on a date more than 30 days after
the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is
duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the Holder would have been
entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the same for payment on any day (including the
last day) within such 30-day period;

164


-----

(f) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471-1474 of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), any current or future regulations
or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to
the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(g) any Taxes that were imposed with respect to any payment on a Note to any fiduciary or partnership or
person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that no Additional Amounts
would have been payable had the beneficial owner of the applicable Note been the holder of such
Note.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect
of any combination of the above items.

The Issuer or Guarantors will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and
remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with
all applicable laws. The Issuer will, upon request, make available to the Holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or if, notwithstanding the
Issuer’s reasonable efforts to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment by the Issuer.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is
due and payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor becomes aware that it will be obliged to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the
30th day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in
which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to enable the Trustee or Paying
Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders on the payment date. The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

In addition, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
transfer, documentation, court, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest or
penalties with respect thereto imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in respect of the
execution, issue, delivery or registration of the Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other
document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than transfers of the Notes following the initial
resale of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers); and (ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any
jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, Guarantees or any other
such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor_
person to the Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in significant operations or resident for tax
purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in the Indenture or this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of principal (and premiums, if any), Redemption Price, interest or any other amount payable
under or with respect to any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such
mention will be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts thereon.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and/or the Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the Collateral, which, on or about the
Issue Date, will consist of:

- a first priority share charge (or, in the case of Spain, pledge) over all of the issued share capital of the
Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales (which, in the case of Victoria Midco Holdings
Limited, will include only its ordinary shares), Australia and Spain;

- a first priority fixed and floating charge over substantially all of the present and future assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales; and

165


-----

- a first priority charge over substantially all of the present and future assets of the Guarantors
incorporated in Australia.

The Collateral will also include any other additional security interests that may in the future be created to
secure obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security and the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.’’_

**_Priority_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will act on behalf of, and the Collateral will
be shared equally and ratably among (but without prejudice to the agreed order of application of proceeds
following the enforcement thereof), the holders of all Debt entitled to the first-ranking security under the
Indenture. This Debt includes the Notes, obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, obligations under
certain Hedging Obligations, if any and any other Debt permitted to be secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture. The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide, among other things, that
the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Credit Facility and certain Hedging
Obligations, if any, will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Notes and Our Structure.’’ In addition, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be_
permitted to create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist other Permitted Collateral Liens as
provided for under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Under certain circumstances,
the amount of such additional Debt secured by the Collateral could be significant.

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment, when
due, of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Indenture, as well as the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facility
and certain Hedging Obligations, if any. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent
will act in its own name but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the
Holders of Notes from time to time), unless otherwise required in accordance with applicable law with
respect to each relevant Security Interest. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also
act as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee
and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the
Senior Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the
Security Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests
in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However,
the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under ‘‘—Release of Security.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the
Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able

166


-----

to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Structure.’’_

The Indenture permits, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the Issuer and the Guarantors to
charge the Collateral in connection with future incurrences of Debt, including any Additional Notes and
Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Release of Security_**

The Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be
discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(1) in connection with any asset sale or disposition or transfer of assets to a Person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Asset Sales’’;_

(2) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes that complies with the provisions under
‘‘—Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(3) as described under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’;

(4) in the case of property and assets and Capital Stock of a Guarantor, to the extent such Guarantor is
released from its Guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture;

(5) to the extent permitted in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ below;_

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture (to the extent of such Restricted Subsidiary’s assets and
property);

(7) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(8) if the Lien granted in favor of the Senior Credit Facility or such other Debt that gave rise to the
obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(9) as provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement, including in accordance with certain enforcement
actions taken pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or
as otherwise provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
or

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

Each of the releases set forth above may be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
holders of the Notes. The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral shall, if requested
by the Issuer, be evidenced by the Security Agent. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all
necessary actions to effectuate the releases described above, subject to customary protections and/or
indemnifications.

**Optional Redemption**

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related to an
Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the Notes,
the incurrence of indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if
such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, provided, however, that, in any case such redemption date shall not be more
than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given, or such redemption may not occur and such
notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

167


-----

In the case of any partial redemption, unless otherwise required by law, the Notes to be redeemed will be
selected in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Notes are listed, and in compliance with the applicable procedures and requirements of the relevant
clearing system(s), or, if the Notes are not listed, and the relevant clearing system(s) have no such
procedures or requirements, then on a _pro rata basis, although no Note of_ A100,000 in original principal
amount or less will be redeemed in part, and only Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 will be redeemed.
The Trustee, Paying Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for any selection made under this paragraph. If
any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption relating to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued and delivered in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Note.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

The Issuer may provide in any notice of redemption that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Excess Proceeds Offer, if Holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of Notes will be deemed to
have consented to such tender offer, and accordingly the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender
offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes (excluding any early
tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption
date.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2020 upon Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to, 2020, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may
on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were
initially issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes)
at a redemption price of % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, with the net proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Issuer may only do this,
however, if:

(a) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued (calculated after
giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) would remain outstanding immediately after the
proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2020_**

At any time prior to, 2020, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may
also redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof
plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2020, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may
redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes that were initially issued under the Indenture (calculated after giving effect
to the issuance of any Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103.0% of the principal amount
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

168


-----

**_Optional Redemption on or after_** **_, 2020_**

At any time on or after, 2020 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be at the following
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
in each of the years set forth below:

**Redemption**

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date and all
Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of
the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that the Issuer or any Guarantor is or,
on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obliged to pay
Additional Amounts (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’) in respect of the Notes or the
Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, which the Issuer or Guarantor cannot avoid by
the use of reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a Paying Agent located
in another jurisdiction and, in the case of a Guarantor, making the payment giving rise to such requirement
through another Guarantor who would not be obligated to pay Additional Amounts if payments through
another Guarantor would be reasonable), as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under ‘‘—Additional Amounts’’)
affecting taxation which is enacted or issued and becomes effective on or after the date of the
Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing Jurisdictions have changed since the date of the Indenture, on or
after the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
under the Indenture; or

(b) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction) on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdictions have changed since the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which such
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (each of the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to
the earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such
notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, sending of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have
occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
Issuer or Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or
Guarantor, as the case may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Law.

169


-----

The Trustee will accept, and is entitled to rely on, such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence, without further enquiry, of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such
successor person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Notice of Optional Redemption_**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, any notice of redemption to the Holders shall be published to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules and regulations of the Exchange and, in connection with any redemption,
the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding. In addition
to such publication, and to the extent and in the manner so required by the rules of the Exchange, not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will send such notice to Holders,
except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. For
Notes which are represented by Global Notes, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to
Euroclear and Clearstream for communication to entitled account Holders. The Notes will be selected in
accordance with the methods described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption—General.’’

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the
Notes as described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.’’ The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and_
from time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise, at such price and on such terms as it
sees fit.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume,
guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become
responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to ‘‘Incur’’ or,
as appropriate, an ‘‘Incurrence’’) any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); _provided, that the Issuer_
and any Guarantor will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if on the date on which
such additional Debt is Incurred, after giving _pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Debt_
(including the _pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio_
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and (b) to the extent that the Debt is Senior Secured Debt, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would have been no greater than 3.25 to 1.0; and

(2) This ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, ‘‘Permitted
Debt’’):

(a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to (i) the
greater of £75.0 million and 67.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Debt permitted under this clause, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(b) (i) the Incurrence by the Issuer of Debt represented by the Notes (other than any Additional
Notes) or (ii) the Incurrence of Debt by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantees (other than

Debt described in clauses (a) or (b) of this paragraph (2));

170


-----

(d) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Debt between the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that:

(i) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Debt and the lender of such Debt is
not the Issuer or a Guarantor, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment
to the prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or
otherwise) and the performance in full of its obligations under the Notes or its Guarantee, as
the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any
transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing from the Issuer
or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each case, be
deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (d);

(e) (i) without limiting the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt,’’ the
guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’
covenant; _provided that if the Debt being guaranteed is subordinated to the Notes, then the_
guarantee shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Debt guaranteed;

(ii) without limiting the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens,’’ Debt arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Debt of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Debt is not prohibited under the
terms of the Indenture;

(f) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt represented by Capitalized
Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, purchase money obligations or other Debt Incurred or
assumed in connection with the acquisition, lease, rental or development and improvement of
real or personal, movable or immovable, property or assets (including, without limitation,
material handling equipment), in each case, Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing
all or any part of the purchase price, lease expense or cost of design, construction, installation or
improvement of property, plant, equipment or other assets used or useful in a Permitted Business
(including any reasonable related fees or expenses Incurred in connection with such acquisition,
lease, rental or development); provided that the principal amount of such Debt (other than such
Debt in relation to delivery, heavy or long goods vehicles used or useful in a Permitted Business
in the ordinary course of business) so Incurred when aggregated with such other Debt previously
Incurred in reliance on this clause (f) and still outstanding shall not in the aggregate exceed the
greater of £20.0 million and 18.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(g) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt arising from agreements
providing for guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of earnouts or other purchase
price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without
limitation, shares of Capital Stock, other than guarantees or similar credit support given by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of
such assets for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided that the maximum aggregate
liability in respect of all such Debt permitted pursuant to this clause (g) will at no time exceed the
gross proceeds, including non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash proceeds
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in
value), actually received from the sale of such assets;

(h) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under any Hedging Agreements
for bona fide hedging purposes and not for speculative purposes;

(i) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt in respect of workers’
compensation and claims arising under similar legislation, or pursuant to self-insurance
obligations, and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or
credit;

(j) Debt owed on a short-term basis of no longer than 30 days to banks and other financial

Subsidiaries with such banks or financial institutions that arises in connection with ordinary

171


-----

(k) the Incurrence of Debt by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary arising from (i) the honoring by
a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn
against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; _provided that such Debt is_
extinguished within 30 business days of Incurrence, (ii) bankers’ acceptances, performance,
surety, judgment, appeal, indemnity, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax or other
guarantees or other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and (iii) completion, advance
payment or customs guarantees provided or letters of credit or similar instruments obtained by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business;

(l) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Permitted Refinancing Debt in
exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to, refund, replace, refinance, defease or
discharge Debt Incurred by it pursuant to, or described in, paragraphs (1), (2)(b), (2)(c), (2)(l)
and (2)(q) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, as the case may be;

(m) customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from
customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business;

(n) Management Advances;

(o) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements in the
ordinary course of business;

(p) Debt consisting of (i) the financing of insurance premiums, (ii) take or pay obligations or
customary deferred payment arrangements contained in supply agreements or (iii) rental
guarantees, in each case, in the ordinary course of business;

(q) (A) the Incurrence of Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to finance an acquisition by
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any merger or consolidation of any Person with or into
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (B) Acquired Debt; provided that, in each case, on the
date of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, after giving effect thereto, either (i) the Issuer
would have been able to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than
it was immediately prior to giving effect thereto;

(r) Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary relating to any VAT liabilities or deferral of
pay-as-you-earn taxes with the agreement of, or pursuant to rules or guidance of, tax authorities;

(s) any Contribution Debt; and

(t) the Incurrence of Debt by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the greater of £50.0 million and 45.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA.

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, in the event that an
item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (a) through (t) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1)
of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Debt on the
date of its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant. Debt
Incurred under the Senior Credit Facility outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been
Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of paragraph (2) above, and
Debt Incurred under the Senior Credit Facility pursuant to clause (a) of paragraph (2) above may not
be reclassified. In addition, from time to time any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred pursuant
to one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (b) through (t) of paragraph (2) above,
or entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, may later
be reclassified by the Issuer such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to such new
clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant to the extent that such
reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant to such new clause of paragraph (2) or paragraph (1) of
this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at the time of such reclassification. Debt permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Debt but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such Debt.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in Sterling
where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Sterling

172


-----

Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; _provided that (a) if any such Debt_
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to Sterling)
covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in Sterling will
be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement; and (b) if such Debt is Incurred to
refinance other Debt denominated in a currency other than Sterling, and such refinancing would
cause the applicable Sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Sterling-denominated restriction
shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Debt
does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (a) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Refinancing Debt.’’
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, for purposes of
determining compliance with this ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant, increases in Debt solely due to
fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(5) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees, Liens, bankers’ acceptance or other similar
instrument or obligation, in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination
of such particular amount will not be included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the ‘‘Limitation on
_Liens’’ covenant will not be treated as Debt; and_

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount
or of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of interest or
dividends in the form of additional Debt, will not, in any case, be treated as Debt.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, take any of
the following actions (each of which is a ‘‘Restricted Payment’’ and which are collectively referred to
as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’):

(a) declare or pay any dividend on or make any distribution (whether made in cash, securities or
other property) with respect to any of the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock
(including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or other combination involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) (other
than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) except for dividends or distributions payable
solely in shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to
acquire such shares of Qualified Capital Stock or in Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(b) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination), directly or
indirectly, any shares of the Issuer’s Capital Stock or any Capital Stock of a Holding Company of
the Issuer held by persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such shares of Capital Stock;

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, prior to any scheduled principal payment, sinking fund payment or Stated Maturity, any
Subordinated Debt (other than (i) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of
payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and
(ii) intercompany Debt between the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or among Restricted
Subsidiaries);

(d) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt
(other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder
Debt); or

(e) make any Restricted Investment in any Person.

173


-----

If any Restricted Payment described above is not made in cash, the amount of the proposed
Restricted Payment will be the Fair Market Value of the asset to be transferred as at the date of
transfer.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make a Restricted
Payment if, at the time of and after giving pro forma effect to such proposed Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) the Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in
paragraph (1) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant; and

(c) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments declared or made after the Issue Date
(excluding Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding paragraph other than
clauses (a) and (n)) does not exceed the sum of:

(i) 50% of aggregate Consolidated Net Income on a cumulative basis during the period
beginning on the first day of the fiscal half commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date
and ending on the last day of the Issuer’s last fiscal half ending prior to the date of such
proposed Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income
shall be a negative number, minus 100% of such negative amount); plus

(ii) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or
marketable securities received by the Issuer after the Issue Date as equity capital
contributions or from the issuance or sale (other than to any Subsidiary) of shares of the
Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock (including upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights)
or warrants, options or rights to purchase shares of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock
(except, in each case to the extent such proceeds are used to purchase, redeem or otherwise
retire Capital Stock or Subordinated Debt as set forth in clauses (c), (d) or (e) of
paragraph (3) below) (excluding (x) any Contribution Amounts and (y) the Net Cash
Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or marketable securities received
from the issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly,
using funds borrowed from the Issuer or any Subsidiary until and to the extent such
borrowing is repaid); plus

(iii) (x) the amount by which the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on
the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet after the Issue Date upon the conversion or exchange
(other than by a Subsidiary) of such Debt into the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock and
(y) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or
marketable securities received after the Issue Date by the Issuer from the issuance or sale
(other than to any Subsidiary) of Redeemable Capital Stock that has been converted into or
exchanged for the Issuer’s Qualified Capital Stock, to the extent such Redeemable Capital
Stock was originally sold for cash or Cash Equivalents, together with, in the case of both
clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property
or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer at the time of such conversion or
exchange (excluding the Net Cash Proceeds from the issuance of the Issuer’s Qualified
Capital Stock financed, directly or indirectly, using funds borrowed from the Issuer or any
Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is repaid); plus

(iv) (x) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions or retirements of any Restricted
Investment, proceeds realized upon the sale or other disposition to a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of any such Restricted Investment, repayments of loans or
advances or other transfers of assets (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest
payments or returns of capital) to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, less the cost of the
disposition of such Investment and net of taxes, (y) if such Investment constituted a
guarantee, an amount equal to the amount of such guarantee upon the full and
unconditional release of such guarantee and (z) in the case of the designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (as long as the designation of such
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market
Value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary; plus

(v) in the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes any Investment in a Person
that, as a result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary,

174


-----

an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
existing interest in such Person that was previously treated as a Restricted Payment.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may take the
following actions:

(a) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days after the
date of its declaration or giving of notice of redemption, as applicable, if at such date of its
declaration or giving of notice of redemption, as applicable, such payment would have been
permitted by the provisions of this ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant;

(b) cash payments in lieu of issuing fractional shares pursuant to the exchange or conversion of any

Subsidiaries and other Persons with which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is required or
permitted to file a consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted

exceed the amount of tax that the Issuer and its Subsidiaries would owe on a standalone basis and
the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are relieved by the payment of such

amount not to exceed in any fiscal year 7% of the Market Capitalization; _provided that after_
giving pro forma effect to such loans, advances, dividends or distributions, the Consolidated Net

176


-----

Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be equal to or less than 3.00 to
1.00; and

(s) payment of any Receivables Fees and purchases of receivables and other assets pursuant to a
Receivables Repurchase Obligation in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing.

(4) The Issuer, in its sole discretion, may classify any Permitted Investment or other Restricted Payment
as being made in part under one of the clauses or sub-clauses of this covenant (or, in the case of any
Permitted Investment, the clauses or sub-clauses of Permitted Investments) and in part under one or
more other such clauses or sub-clauses.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the
sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater than
the greater of £5.0 million and 4.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, unless such transaction or series of
transactions is entered into in good faith and:

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could
have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer) with a Person that is not an Affiliate; and

(b) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments or
the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than the
greater of £15.0 million and 13.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will deliver a resolution
of its Board of Directors (attached to an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee) resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (a) above and that the fairness of such transaction has been
approved by a majority of the Disinterested Members, if any, of the Board of Directors.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(a) reasonable directors’ fees, indemnities and similar arrangements (including the payment of
directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums), consulting and advisory fees, employee
compensation, employee and director bonuses, directorship, employment or consulting
agreements and arrangements, collective bargaining agreements, employee benefit arrangements,
including vacation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
other similar plans, programs or arrangements or legal fees payable to any current or former
employee, officer or director as long as the Issuer’s Board of Directors has approved the terms
thereof and deemed the services performed or thereafter to be performed for amounts to be fair
consideration therefor;

(b) Permitted Investments (other than pursuant to clause (c)(iii), (q) or (u) of the definition thereof)
and any Restricted Payment not prohibited by the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant;

(c) any Management Advances or Permitted Parent Payments and any waiver or transaction with
respect thereto;

(d) agreements, instruments and arrangements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment,
extension, renewal, refinancing, modification or supplement thereto and any payments or
transaction in relation thereto; _provided that any such amendment, extension, renewal,_
refinancing, modification or supplement to the terms thereof is not more disadvantageous (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer), taken as a whole, to the Holders of the Notes and to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any material respect than the original
agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(e) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar
transfers pursuant to, or for the purpose of the funding of, directorship, employment or
consulting arrangements, stock options, stock ownership plans and other similar arrangements, as
long as the terms thereof are or have been previously approved by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors;

(f) the granting and performance of registration rights for the Issuer’s securities;

177


-----

(g) transactions between or among the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries;

(h) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) of the Issuer or options,
warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Capital Stock);

(i) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights
agreement or purchase agreement relating thereto) to which it is a party as at the Issue Date and
any similar agreements which it may enter into thereafter; _provided,_ _however, that the existence_
of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of, obligations under
any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered
into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (i) to the extent that the terms of
any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer) to the Holders of the Notes when taken as a whole;

(j) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary solely
(x) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock in such Person (including,
without limitation, any such Person that is a Captive Insurance Company), (y) because the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary has the right to designate one or more members of the Board of
Directors or similar governing body of such Person, or (z) as a result of both such ownership of
Capital Stock and such right to so designate;

(k) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms materially no less favorable than those that
could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer);

(l) the execution of, delivery of and performance under any Tax Sharing Agreement; and

(m) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist any Lien on any of its property or assets, whether owned on the date of the Indenture
or thereafter acquired, securing any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (the ‘‘Initial
Lien’’), unless (a) in the case of any property or assets that does not constitute Collateral, (i) such
Lien is a Permitted Lien or (ii) contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the
Notes and the Indenture or, in respect of Liens on property or assets of any Guarantor, such
Guarantee thereof, equally and ratably with (or, in the case of Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a
Guarantor on a senior basis to) such Debt for so long as such Debt is so secured by such Initial Lien
and (b) in the case of any property or assets that constitute Collateral, such Lien is a Permitted
Collateral Lien.

(2) Any such Lien created as a result of this covenant ‘‘Limitation on Liens’’ in favor of the Notes or any
such Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates or (ii) as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Security.’’

**_Change of Control_**

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’)
to each Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal amount of
A100,000 or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof at a purchase price (the ‘‘Change of
Control Purchase Price’’) in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Date’’).

(2) Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of the Change of Control
Offer, with a copy to the Trustee, Registrar and each Paying Agent, to each Holder of Notes appearing
in the register on such date, which notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred and the date it occurred;

178


-----

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a
business day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent, or
such later date as is necessary to comply with any requirements under the Exchange Act or any
other applicable securities laws or regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price
is not paid on such date;

(e) that any Note or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or
to withdraw such acceptance.

(3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control, the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a
principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of
Notes in global form or to each Holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note will be
in a principal amount of A100,000 or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) the Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under
‘‘Optional Redemption’’ or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of the
Notes in the manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer
purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such tender offer. No Note will be purchased in part if less than
A100,000 in original principal amount of such Note would remain outstanding following such
purchase.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules and any other applicable
securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will comply with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached their obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any
Change of Control Offer to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules. In addition, for so long
as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, such notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or
on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default
under the Senior Credit Facility. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries may also
contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased. In addition, the
exercise by the Holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of
Control could cause a default under the Senior Credit Facility and any such future debt, even if the Change
of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the Issuer or the Guarantors of such
repurchase. Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a
Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes. The
provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in the
event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that
may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of
Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the
Indenture, including those described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt.’’ The existence,
however, of a Holder of the Notes’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a
Change of Control may deter a third party from acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such
acquisition would constitute a Change of Control.

179


-----

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will have
available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be
delivered by Holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if sufficient funds
were available, the terms of any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may prohibit the repurchase of
the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to prepay any debt containing any
such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be unable to fulfil its repurchase
obligations to Holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was
not made or consummated or the Change of Control Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure
would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes the rights
described under ‘‘—Events of Default.’’ An Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, would
result in a cross-default under certain of the financing arrangements described under ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements,’’ including under the Senior Credit Facility._

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred
and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes. See ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’ below.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale
unless:

(a) the consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility
for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for
such Asset Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer (provided that the Issuer’s Board of Directors shall determine in good faith the
Fair Market Value for any Asset Sale or series of related Asset Sales involving aggregate
consideration in excess of £25.0 million), and the Issuer’s determination (including the Board of
Directors’ determination, as applicable) will be conclusive (as to the value of any and all non-cash
consideration);

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 180 days
of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash or
Cash Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations
received in consideration of such Asset Sale);

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale,
if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such
Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale; _provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such_
Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time
of receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this

180


-----

clause (v), less the amount of Net Proceeds previously realized in cash from prior Designated
Non-cash Consideration does not exceed (with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non- cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of £25.0 million and 22.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA; or

(vi) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (v); and

(c) the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such Asset Sale complies
with the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Sale, within 365 days of the receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or
any such Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net
Cash Proceeds are so used within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period),
may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt,’’ that is secured by the Collateral on
a basis pari passu with or in priority to the Notes and is not subordinated in right of payment to
the Notes or any Guarantee; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Debt of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Debt that is secured by Liens on assets which do not
constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Debt or Debt that is owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Debt
secured by a Lien on the Collateral at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of
such Pari Passu Debt plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the Issuer shall redeem, repay, repurchase or
redeem any such Pari Passu Debt pursuant to this clause (iii) only if the Issuer makes an offer to
the Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
below for an Excess Proceeds Offer on a ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Debt repaid
pursuant to this clause (iii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Excess Proceeds Offer for
purposes hereof); or (iv) to make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant)
an offer to the Holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set
forth below for an Excess Proceeds Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Excess Proceeds
Offer for purposes hereof);

(b) to invest in any Replacement Assets or make capital expenditures (including by means of capital
expenditure by, or an investment in Replacement Assets by, a Restricted Subsidiary with an
amount equal to some or all of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary); or

(c) do any combination of the foregoing.

(d) The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds actually received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary but not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’
Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £25.0 million and 22.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will, within 30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an
‘‘Excess Proceeds Offer’’) from all Holders of Notes and, at the Issuer’s election, from the holders of
any Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt,
the maximum principal amount, in the case of the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of A100,000
and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may
be purchased with the amount of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such
Pari Passu Debt will be payable in cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of
the principal amount of such Note being repurchased and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no
greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt
being redeemed or repurchased, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase.

181


-----

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt, if any,
for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by
holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari Passu
Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of Notes
and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder). Upon
completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari
Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of A100,000
and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not
later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such Holders, or
such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise use the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
tender offer rules and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including the requirements
of any applicable securities exchange on which Notes are then listed. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’
covenant, the Issuer will comply with such securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations described in this ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt_**

(1) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for
the payment of any Debt outstanding under any Credit Facility Incurred under clause (2)(a) of the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’ or any other Public Debt of the Issuer or any
Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless such Restricted Subsidiary either (i) is not a Significant
Subsidiary and, in respect of any Debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility (as may be
refinanced, amended or restated from time to time) only, has not become a Guarantor under the
Senior Credit Facility, provided that any such Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary
also would not, in the aggregate when taken together with other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Significant Subsidiaries, constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single person or
(ii) executes and delivers within 30 days a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a
Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee
of such other Debt; and with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such Restricted
Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee with
respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is subordinated to the
Notes. Any Guarantee of payment of the Notes may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law or regulation.

(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted
Subsidiary existing on the Issue Date or that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary if the guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

(3) Any Guarantee of the Notes granted pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of this
covenant may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances described under the heading
‘‘—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees.’’ A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released
at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Debt of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as
a Guarantor as at that date. At the cost and reasonable request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall take all
necessary actions to effectuate any release of any Guarantee of the Notes in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

182


-----

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to
the Agreed Security Principles or to the extent such Guarantee would reasonably be expected (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) to give rise to or result in (a) any conflict with or violation of
applicable law, rule, regulation or order; (b) any risk of liability (civil, criminal, administrative or
other) for the officers, directors, shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) any
cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable
guarantee or similar fee payable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable
expenses and other than reasonable governmental expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of
any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital
Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and
(ii) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or
advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt Incurred by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance
or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the ‘‘Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
_Subsidiaries’’ covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:_

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or
the Senior Credit Facility;

(b) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt permitted to be Incurred under Credit Facilities or
any guarantee thereof in accordance with the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant or pursuant to
paragraph (2) of such ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant; _provided that in the case of any such_
encumbrances or restrictions imposed under any Credit Facilities, such encumbrances or
restrictions taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole
than those imposed by the Senior Credit Facility as at the Issue Date (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer);

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument in effect on the Issue
Date;

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances

any properties or assets that are subject to a lease, sublease, license, sublicense, conveyance or
other similar agreement to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party; or
(ii) contained in operating leases for real property and restricting only the transfer of such real
property upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a default in the payment of rent;

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person or
relating to assets acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such
acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the
property or assets of the Person, so acquired;

183


-----

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets permitted
by the ‘‘Limitation on Asset Sales’’ covenant with respect to the assets or Capital Stock to be sold

enter into such contract) for the purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or assets or any of the
Issuer’s Subsidiaries by another Person;

(g) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law or regulation or by governmental

Subsidiary in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale and leaseback agreements,
stock sale agreements and other similar agreements entered into the ordinary course of business
and in good faith; provided that:

(i) the encumbrance or restriction is not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a
whole than is customary in comparable agreements (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer); and

(ii) the Issuer determines in good faith that any such encumbrance or restriction will not
materially affect the ability of the Issuer or any Guarantor to make any principal or interest
payments on the Notes;

(j) customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection with purchase money obligations,
mortgage financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business;

provisions in agreements;

(l) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries relating to any Debt not prohibited from being Incurred after
the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Debt’’: (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument_
taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer); or (ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the
Holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by
the Issuer);

(m) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances or
restrictions existing by reason of any Lien permitted under ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’;

(n) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to any Hedging Agreements;

(o) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real
property interests set forth in any reciprocal easements agreements of the Issuer or any

(p) any encumbrance or restriction that arises or is agreed to in the ordinary course of business and
does not detract from the value of property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
any manner material to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (as determined in good faith by
the Issuer);

(q) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to
effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(r) any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements,
renewals, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the
contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) through (q), or in this clause (r), of
this paragraph (2); _provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,_
extension, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith

184


-----

judgment of the Issuer, no more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances
or restrictions than those contained in the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, extension, increase, supplement, refunding,
replacement or refinancing.

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly
established Subsidiaries) to cease to be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ and instead to be an ‘‘Unrestricted
Subsidiary’’ only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such designation;

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant
(and may classify such amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments and ability to
make payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted
_Payments’’ covenant as it sees fit) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of_
the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market
Value of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good
faith); and

(c) the Issuer would be permitted under the Indenture to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt
pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant at the time
of such designation (assuming the effectiveness of such designation).

(2) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment
constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant for all
purposes of the Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s
interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the
Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary (in each case, as determined by the Issuer in good faith), and may
classify such amount within its capacity to make Restricted Payments and permissions to make
payments that would otherwise be Restricted Payments under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’
covenant as it sees fit.

(3) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur and
be continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) unless such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not have any Debt outstanding (other than
Debt that would be Permitted Debt), immediately before and after giving effect to such proposed
designation, and after giving _pro forma effect to the Incurrence of any such Debt of such_
designated Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Debt was Incurred on the date of its designation as
a Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the
ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant.

(4) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors with
the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such designation.
Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal half year
in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the second fiscal half
year of the Issuer’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

**_Reports to Holders_**

(1) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two
most recent fiscal years, including complete notes to such financial statements and the report of
the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an operating and financial review of the

185


-----

audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (c) a description of the business of the
Issuer; and (d) a description of management and shareholders, material debt instruments,
material affiliate transactions, material risk factors and material subsequent events all in
substantially the same form as presented in the Offering Memorandum, within 120 days following
the end of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019; provided that the
information in clause (d) may be provided in the notes to the audited financial statements.

(b) semi-annual financial information of the Issuer on a consolidated basis as of and for the period
from the beginning of each year to the close of the first half period, together with comparable
information for the corresponding period of the preceding year, and an operating and financial
review of the financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition, and material changes in liquidity and financial resources of the Issuer within 90 days
following the end of the fiscal half beginning with the fiscal half ending September 30, 2019; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, any change
of the Chief Executive Officer or the Group Financial Director of the Issuer or a change in
auditors of the Issuer or any other material event, a report containing a description of such event.

(2) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

(3) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the semi-annual and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this ‘‘Reports to Holders’’ covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(4) For so long as it remains so listed, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that the
Issuer is required to make publicly available under the requirements of the London Stock Exchange as
a result of having its ordinary shares admitted for trading on such exchange. Notwithstanding
paragraph (1) of this covenant, upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements of
the London Stock Exchange (regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for
trading on such exchange), to the extent that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and
make publicly available annual reports, semi-annual reports, information, documents and other
reports, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (1)(a),
(b) and (c) above.

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the
Trustee, the Holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information
referenced above in clauses (1)(a), (b) and (c) and (3) above or alternatively, in the preceding
paragraph, has been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**_Statement as to Compliance_**

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

**_Issuer_**

(1) The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions,
merge, consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by
the Issuer’s Board of Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to
which the Issuer would dispose of, all or substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Restricted
Subsidiaries’ properties and assets, taken as a whole, to any other Person. The previous sentence will

186


-----

not apply if at the time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of
transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the
Issuer) formed by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination or to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, has been made (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United States of America, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland; and

(y) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, an accession agreement or one or more
other documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis
(and treating any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with or
as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will
have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis
(on the assumption that the transaction or series of transactions occurred on the first day of the
fiscal half immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or series of transactions
with the appropriate adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of transactions being
included in such pro forma calculation), (i) the Issuer (or the Surviving Entity if the Issuer is not
the continuing obligor under the Indenture) could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt
pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the ‘‘Limitation on Debt’’ covenant or (ii) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
opinion of counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination or sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a
supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
indenture, comply with the requirements of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the
Indenture relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, enforceable in
accordance with their terms (subject to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and
qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, provided, however, that in the case of a lease of
all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the Notes.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent (i) any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) the Issuer from consolidating or otherwise combining with or
merging into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of
the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Issuer,
_provided the requirements of clauses (a)(x) and (d) of paragraph (1) above are satisfied, mutatis_
mutandis.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any merger of the Issuer to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by

187


-----

Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Guarantors_**

(1) Subject to the provisions described under ‘‘—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,’’ no Guarantor
will, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions, merge,
consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed by such
Guarantor’s Board of Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to
which such Guarantor will dispose of, all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s properties and assets
to any other Person. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time and immediately after giving
effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation, or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation
organized or existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as at the Issue
Date, the United States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be,
being herein called the ‘‘Successor Guarantor’’);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor), by a supplemental indenture, an
accession agreement or one or more other documents or instruments, each in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, expressly assumes the obligations of such Guarantor under its
Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(c) immediately after giving _pro forma effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default_
exists and is continuing; and

(d) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination or sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a
supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental
indenture, comply with the requirements of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the
Indenture relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the
Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor or Successor
Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to customary assumptions,
exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability).

(2) The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into
or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action, which action or omission would or is reasonably likely to, in each case,
in the good faith determination of the Issuer, have the result of materially impairing the security interest
with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or of
Debt secured by the Collateral shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall
not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the

188


-----

Security Agent and the holders of the Notes (other than of any Additional Notes), the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral (other than pursuant to a sale, lease, transfer,
disposition, merger or conveyance not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture), provided that (a) nothing in
this provision will restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
(b) subject to the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Indenture will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of the
Notes, the Security Agent (and/or any other party to each Security Document) shall from time to time
enter into one or more amendments, extensions, renewals, restatements, supplements, modifications or
replacements to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein, (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens to the extent not prohibited under the Indenture
(including by way of release and retaking of Security Documents), (iii) comply with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) add to the Collateral,
(v) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any security provider, as
applicable, and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, Notes or its
Guarantee, as the case may be, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents, as applicable, in each case, in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,’’ (vi) provide for the release of property and assets_
constituting Collateral from the Liens created under the Security Documents and/or the release of a
Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Notes, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the
terms of the Indenture, (vii) conform the Security Documents to this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’
(viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Security Agent,
(ix) provide for Additional Notes or other Permitted Debt not prohibited by the Indenture that may be
secured by Liens on the Collateral to also benefit from the Collateral, or (x) make any other change
thereto that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer); _provided, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended,_
renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced (otherwise than for reasons specified
in clauses (i), (iii) (in connection with any enforcement action) or (iv) through (x)), unless
contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
renewal, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Security Agent, one of:

(a) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, on a consolidated basis, in each case, after giving effect to any transaction related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement;

(b) a certificate from the Board of Directors or responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer
(acting in good faith) substantially in the form attached to the Indenture that confirms the solvency of
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on a consolidated basis, in each case,
after giving effect to any transaction related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement; or

(c) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to
customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications), confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement, the security interest or security interests created under the Security
Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid
security interests not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law that such security interest or security interests were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification
or replacement.

In the event that this covenant is complied with, the Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to and instruct the Security Agent to enter into all necessary documentation to
implement such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, in
connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any Debt not prohibited by the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ (and, in each case, such Debt shall
be (x) Senior Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor or (y) Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a Guarantor),
the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security Agent shall enter into with
the holders of such Debt (or their duly authorized Representatives) an amended and/or restated
Intercreditor Agreement or an additional intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor
Agreement’’) containing substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms more
favorable to the Holders) including with respect to the subordination, payment blockage, limitation on
enforcement and release of guarantees (or such other terms or with such changes as are necessary to
facilitate compliance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Debt’’) and priority and release of the Security Documents (or such other terms or with such_
changes as the Issuer may in good faith determine to be necessary or appropriate relating to the Security
Documents, in connection with the Incurrence of such Debt, provided that such other terms are not
materially more adverse to the Holders taken as a whole than the terms contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement); _provided, that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal_
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Trustee and the Security Agent. Pursuant to any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreements, such other Debt may constitute Senior Debt or Subordinated Debt of the Issuer or a
Guarantor. If more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict in any material respect.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time
enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, manifest error, omission, defect or inconsistency of any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (2) increase the amount of Debt of
the types covered by any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that may be
Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including the addition of provisions relating to new Debt that
is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or its Guarantee, as the case may be, as
applicable), (3) add Guarantors to any Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) add security to or for the benefit of the Notes (including Additional Notes), or confirm and evidence
the release, termination or discharge of any Notes, its Guarantee, or any Lien (including Liens on the
Collateral and the Security Documents) when such release, termination or discharge is provided for or not
prohibited under the Indenture, any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(5) make provision for charges of the Collateral securing Additional Notes to rank pari passu with the
Liens under the Security Documents or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (6) provide for the
assumption by a successor of the obligations of the Issuer under any Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (7) make any change in the subordination provisions of any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement that would limit or terminate the
benefits available to any holder of Senior Debt of a Guarantor (or any Representative thereof) under such
subordination provisions or as otherwise permitted by any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (8) conform the text of any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes,’’ or (9) make any other change to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement that does not materially adversely affect
the Holders. The Issuer shall not otherwise request the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Issuer may only request the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee and the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee and the Security Agent under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement or
an Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, no consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase,

190


-----

repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the
Notes thereby will be required; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of each Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein) and to have irrevocably appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement and to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

A copy of each Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available
for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the offices
of the Issuer or at the offices of the listing agent.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ‘‘Suspension Event’’), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
‘‘Reversion Date’’), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to the Notes:

(1) ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

(2) ‘‘—Limitation on Debt’’;

(3) ‘‘—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(4) ‘‘—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates’’;

(5) ‘‘—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt’’;

(6) clause (1)(c) of ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’ in respect of each of the Issuer and the
Guarantors;

(7) ‘‘—Limitation on Asset Sales’’; and

(8) ‘‘—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,’’

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, neither the Issuer nor any
Restricted Subsidiary may designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,’’ unless
such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period._

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect
with regard to actions of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event
of Default. The ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect
since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion
Date, all Debt Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Debt.’’ In addition, the Indenture will also permit,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any
contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension
Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. Upon the
occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Issuer shall
notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied,
_provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under_
this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be

191


-----

deemed to have any duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the
occurrence of a Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an
Investment Grade Status.

**Financial calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection
with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default
or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such
Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a _pro_
_forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be_
entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) as
if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability
to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio).

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Fixed
Charges of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to
the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether
the Limited Condition Acquisition and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such
baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or
related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time
of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Debt and the
use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are
entered into and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon
acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure by the Issuer to comply with the provisions of ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or
_Sale of Assets’’;_

(d) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
contained in the Indenture (other than specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) (solely as it relates to the
Issuer) above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 days after notice by the Trustee on behalf
of the Holders or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(e) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt for borrowed money (other
than any such Debt owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, if that default:

(i) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt; or

(ii) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the
expiration of any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required
prepayment) and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of such
Debt has not been extended (a ‘‘Payment Default’’),

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Debt, together with the principal amount of any
other such Debt under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates £25.0 million or more;

(f) any Guarantee by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be, or shall be asserted in
writing by any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in

192


-----

accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture or any Guarantee), if such
Default continues for 10 days;

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by insurance)
shall have been rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary for the payment of money
either individually or in an aggregate amount, in each case in excess of £25.0 million (after deducting
any insurance or indemnity or contribution amounts actually recovered by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary within 60 days of such judgment, order or decree), and either a creditor shall have
commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such judgment, order or decree or there shall have been
a period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order
or decree was not (by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in effect;

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, schemes of arrangement
(where any creditors are materially impaired) or reorganization with respect to the Issuer, any
Significant Subsidiary, or of other Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but
would, in the aggregate, when taken together (as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal
period) constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person; and

(i) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable) with respect to
Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of £15.0 million for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, as applicable, or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a Default under clauses (d), (e) or (g) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (d) and (g) the Issuer does not cure such default
within the time specified in clauses (d) or (g) above, as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (h) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or
the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written
notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders) may, and the Trustee, upon
the written request of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional
Amounts and accrued interest on all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any
such declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become immediately due and
payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holder of Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (e) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (e) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the
Debt that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due
solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

193


-----

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture (except a default in
the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which
case, the consent of the Holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind any
such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and provided that the fees and expenses of the
Trustee have been paid.

No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or
any remedy thereunder unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes have made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the
Trustee to institute such proceedings as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed
to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such written notice and receipt of indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to it and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions
inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for
the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest
on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and written notice from the Issuer is given to a responsible
officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will deliver to
each Holder of the Notes notice of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence.
Except in the case of an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional
Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the giving of such notice to the Holders of
such Notes if it determines in good faith that withholding the giving of such notice is in the best interests of
the Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders’’ or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying
with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no
Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders provide to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might
be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity of
the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from
the trust referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the
Notes and segregate and hold such payments on trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, indemnities and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the
Issuer and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

194


-----

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default other than an Event of Default under clauses (a) or (b) of the definition thereof.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’)
and thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events
described under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the
Notes. These events will not include events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership
and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it has
previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee, or such other
entity as may be designated for this purpose, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in euros,
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in
the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay and
discharge the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the outstanding
Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer
must:

(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; and

(ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the outstanding
Notes;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that (and based thereon
such opinion shall confirm that) the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes
will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing: (i) on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit); or (ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in clause (h) of ‘‘—Events of
_Default’’ above are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of_
such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a Default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or instrument to which
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is
bound;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel (subject to customary
assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to enforceability) in
the country of the Issuer’s incorporation to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit,
the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and an opinion of counsel (subject
to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including as to

195


-----

enforceability) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee that the Trustee shall have a perfected security
interest in such trust funds for the rateable benefit of the Holders of the Notes;

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of
the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or
other creditors, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing debts of
the Issuer to the detriment of the relevant creditors;

(h) no event or condition exists that would prevent the Issuer from making payments of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any
time ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit; and

(i) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee or such other entity to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because
of any acceleration occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain
liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity as
is designated for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount in euros or European
Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such Notes that have not,
prior to such time, been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if
any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the date of such
deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of Notes at Stated
Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been deposited
by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer as provided for in the Indenture) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation: (x) have become due
and payable (by reason of the sending, or delivery to Euroclear and Clearstream in the case of a
Global Note, of a notice of redemption or otherwise); (y) will become due and payable within one
year of Stated Maturity; or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year of the proposed
discharge date under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption provided to it by the Issuer by the Paying Agent in the Issuer’s name and at the
Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture;
_provided that if requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request_
may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate) no
later than five (5) Business Days or such shorter period as the Trustee or the Paying Agent may agree
prior to such distribution, the Trustee or the Paying Agent may distribute any amounts deposited prior
to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; _provided,_ _further, that in such case, the_
payment to each Holder will equal the amount such Holder would have been entitled to receive at
maturity or on the relevant redemption date, as the case may be, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or relevant redemption date as set forth
above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any other
premium on such amounts. To the extent that the Notes are represented by Global Notes deposited
with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a

196


-----

participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing
system;

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes at maturity, on the redemption date or such earlier date as instructed by the
Issuer in accordance with clause (b) above, as the case may be; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee (i) an Officer’s Certificate and (ii) an opinion of counsel
(subject to customary assumptions, exceptions, reservations and qualifications, in each case including
as to enforceability), each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to
the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been satisfied.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel
without independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact) (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such Notes), the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Agents (as applicable) are
permitted to amend or supplement (or, with respect to any Security Document, require the other relevant
parties thereto to amend or supplement) the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or waive any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof (unless a modification or amendment will only affect one series of
the Notes, in which case only the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding in such series shall be required); provided that no such modification,
amendment or waiver may, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then
outstanding principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (or, if a modification or amendment will only
affect one series of the Notes, the consent of the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding in such series):

(a) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of or Additional Amounts or interest
on, any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (a) of the definition thereof
related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate of or
extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of
Default under clause (b) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(c) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’;

(d) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional
Amounts or the interest thereon is payable on or after the due dates thereof;

(e) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance with
the provisions of such Note and the Indenture;

(f) make any change to the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence;

(g) release any Guarantee, other than in compliance with the guarantor release provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); and

(h) release any Lien on the Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders, other than in compliance
with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors,
the Trustee and the Agents (as applicable) may modify, amend or supplement (or, with respect to any
Security Document, require the other relevant parties thereto to amend or supplement) the Indenture, the

197


-----

Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees or the
Security Documents, as applicable, to:

(a) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by any
such successor of the covenants in the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, as applicable, in
accordance with ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(b) add to the Issuer’s covenants or those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes
for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuer or any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes, as applicable, in the Indenture,
the Notes or any Guarantee;

(c) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect error or inconsistency;

(d) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, or any Guarantee to any
provision of this Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the
_Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim or substantially verbatim recitation of a provision of the_
Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) release any Guarantor in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement);

(f) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt’’ or ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Debt,’’ to add Guarantees, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to_
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment
is not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents;

(g) evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture;

(h) make any change that would provide additional rights of or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights of or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents (as determined by the Issuer in good
faith in respect of Holders); and

(i) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted by the terms of and
limitations set forth in the Indenture.

The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of
counsel as to the permissibility of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment to the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the
Guarantees in a currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or
otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such
Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent
of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase euro on that
date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount that could be recovered
following such a purchase is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the recipient against the cost of

198


-----

the recipient’s making a further purchase of euro in an amount equal to such difference. For the purposes
of this paragraph, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated herein for the Trustee and/or Holder
to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of euro been made with the amount so
received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of euro on that date
had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible). These indemnities, to the
extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Notices**

For so long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations. In addition, for so long as
any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on
behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed; and _provided,_ _further, that any notice delivered via e-mail or other electronic_
means shall be deemed to have been ‘‘sent’’ in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Any notice or
communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent
means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to send
a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to
other Holders. If a notice or communication is sent in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is
duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release
will be part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**The Trustee and the Security Agent**

HSBC Corporate Trustee Company (UK) Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which written notice
from the Issuer is given to a responsible officer of the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of
the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default, of which written notice from the Issuer is given to a
responsible officer of Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care
that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take
or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, certain
taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

199


-----

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction.

Barclays Bank PLC will initially act as Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents on behalf of the secured creditors, including the Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent,
acting in its capacity as such, shall have such duties with respect to the Collateral as are set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Under
certain circumstances, the Security Agent may have obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents that are in conflict with the interests of the
Holders. The Security Agent will be under no obligation to exercise any rights or powers conferred under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any of the Security Documents for the benefit of the secured creditors
(other than the Trustee) unless such secured creditors (other than the Trustee) have provided to the
Security Agent indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Security Agent against any loss, liability or
expense. Furthermore, each Holder, by accepting the Notes will agree, for the benefit of the Security
Agent, that it is solely responsible for its own independent appraisal of, and investigation into, all risks
arising under or in connection with the Security Documents and has not relied on or will not at any time
rely on the Security Agent or the Trustee in respect of such risks.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY AND**
**THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
interests in each of the jurisdictions in which Guarantees or Collateral are being provided. It is a summary
only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of
these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply,
and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes,
the Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral.

Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in England and Wales, Spain
and Australia. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_European Union_**

The Issuer and some of the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member states of
the European Union.

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the ‘‘Insolvency Regulation’’) applies to
insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than
Denmark) where the company concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ The determination of where
any such company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views.

The term ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person,
the centre of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence
of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to
another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the
registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member
state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the
relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual
center of management and supervision of its interests is located in that other EU member state.

If the centre of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an
EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types
of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed
in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation.

If the centre of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under
Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark)
have jurisdiction to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if
such company has an ‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any
insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in
effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings.
An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings
opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in
such other EU member state.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in
which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency

227


-----

proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment
and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s
centre of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency
proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the
establishment or a public authority requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the
insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject
to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court
that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court
opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so
long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a
court in an EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers
conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove
assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, as long as no
insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure
taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state
where the company has assets.

It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the
regulatory environment in the EU.

**_England and Wales_**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales (an ‘‘English company’’). As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English
company should be commenced in England based on English insolvency laws; although insolvency
proceedings in respect of English companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain
circumstances (see ‘‘—European Union’’ above).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or
the holder of a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (discussed below) making an application for administration out
of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the
case of a liquidation). An English company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be
placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is
reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (as described below).

Under the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (the ‘‘Insolvency Act’’), a company is deemed to be unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (i.e. it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (i.e. it is provided to the
satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt
(or similar court order).

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English
company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the
identity of the person making the appointment. During the administration, in general, no resolution may
be passed, and no order may be made, for the winding up of the debtor and no proceedings or other legal
process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s
property, except with permission of the court or the consent of the administrator.

Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s
property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements
for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal
proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either
case, a court will consider a range of discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light
of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

228


-----

Accordingly, if an English company were to enter into administration, the collateral granted by that
English company could not be enforced while that English company was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the security agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of an English company
(save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators’ powers, and those permitted by
the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and,
subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge).

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s
property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the
administration moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, a charge
over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
‘‘FCARs’’).

It is likely, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, that the security granted by an
English company may not be enforced while it is in administration.

The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of
the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary
objective); (2) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be
likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the secondary objective); or
(3) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured
or preferential creditors (the tertiary objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives
of administration in order, unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the
primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors
as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the tertiary objective unless he thinks that it is not
reasonably practicable to achieve either the primary objective or the secondary objective and that it will not
unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the tertiary objective.

**_Administrative receivership_**

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver to an English company, the
floating charge granted by the relevant English company must constitute a qualifying floating charge for
the purposes of English insolvency law and the qualifying floating charge must, unless the relevant Security
Document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions of the Insolvency Act to the
prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge in England, the floating charge must be created by an
instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if it holds one or more debentures
secured by (a) a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the
relevant English company’s property, (b) a number of qualifying floating charges which, together, relate to
the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English company’s property, or (c) charges and other
forms of security which, together, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English
company’s property and one of the charges is a qualifying floating charge.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if
the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant company under the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital market investment’’ (which is defined in
the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). Where a company is in
administrative receivership, an administrator can only be appointed by court order (and only in the limited
circumstances set out in the Insolvency Act). The appointment of an administrator automatically dismisses
any administrative receiver already appointed to the debtor, and any already appointed fixed charge
receiver must resign if requested to do so by the administrator, subject to the application of the FCARs.
Where the company is already in administration, no receiver may be appointed.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company are
realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the
Insolvency Act (see below ‘‘Priority of claims’’). At the end of the liquidation process the company will
normally be dissolved.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary
liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary
liquidation (‘‘MVL’’) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (‘‘CVL’’). The most common grounds for the
compulsory winding-up of a company is that it is either unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of
the Insolvency Act) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound
up.

The effect of a compulsory liquidation differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation.
In a compulsory liquidation, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it
is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. In the case of
a liquidation commenced by way of an English court order, there is a stay on the commencement or
continuation of proceedings against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as
the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected).

In the context of a voluntary liquidation however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind up. As a
result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the
case of a voluntary liquidation—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to
apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured
creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the
shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by
the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must
swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company’s
affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of
the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no
court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of
solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different
person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal
proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for
its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the
company, to disclaim any onerous property by serving a prescribed notice on the relevant party and to
challenge antecedent transactions.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is
placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or
security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English
company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by
such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s
insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest or
guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as
valid.

230


-----

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (all discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued or (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory
liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a
voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency will be as for the initial administration.

_Connected persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by
the company with a ‘‘connected person’’, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will
apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A ‘‘connected person’’ of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the
company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate
of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or
(ii) it is controlled by a person, that person’s associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is
controlled by a group of two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either
consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or
more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting
power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or
more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the
company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to
any security interest or guarantee granted by an English company include, without limitation, the
following.

_Transaction at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at
an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or in
consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay
its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English
company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date
the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being
set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received
no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s
worth, than the consideration given by such company.

However, a court will generally not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the
transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the

231


-----

company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings,
it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its
debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as set out above), in which case there
is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English
company in such proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person with whom the
company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which
was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in
good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where that
person was a party to the transaction.

**Preference**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believed that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a
preference. It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or
the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the
date the English company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction
may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company
going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had
that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the
court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had
it not entered into the transaction.

However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential result. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts and that there was such
desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in
which case the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such desire, on
the part of the company, to prefer them.

An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person
whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any
interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value,
or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of
the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time
when he was a creditor of the company.

The desire to prefer requires a ‘‘positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the
company’s insolvent liquidation’’ (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd 1993 BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a
creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by
‘‘proper commercial considerations’’ there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference
(Re MC Bacon Ltd (No. 1) 1990 BCLC 324).

**Transaction defrauding creditors**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was
made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim
against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that
person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding
creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction and is
not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit in the English
insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to

232


-----

be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was
a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to
what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the
victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation
on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the
debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from such transaction to pay any sum unless such person was a
party to the transaction.

**Extortionate credit transaction**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years
before the day on which the English company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**Fixed versus floating charges**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security,
namely: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash
and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet certain, statutory administration
expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company) while
in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created
after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged
assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted);
(c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders) properly
incurred in a winding-up or administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company
(including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims (the
same does not apply to fixed charge assets); (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is
entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business,
meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party
good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) there are particular insolvency ‘‘clawback’’ risks in
relation to floating charge security; (f) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral
arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as
employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid pension
contributions) and (ii) subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see ‘‘—Prescribed part’’ below) for
unsecured creditors; and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to
a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder
retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating
charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge
provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the
administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the charge holder.

There is a possibility that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be
created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among
other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to
deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a
purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to
hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those
assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported

233


-----

fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings; and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge
security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant
company and therefore may not constitute a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ (see also ‘‘Administrative
receivership’’ above).

**Avoidance of floating charges**

Under English insolvency law, floating charges created by an English company that is unable to pay its
debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge, will be invalid, except to the extent of
the value of (i) the money paid to, or (ii) the goods or services supplied to, or (iii) any discharge or
reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge (plus certain interest) (the ‘‘Consideration’’). The requirement for an English company to
be insolvent at the time of granting the floating charge or becoming insolvent as a consequence of doing so
does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted
to a connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the Consideration.

The transaction can be challenged if the relevant English company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two
years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) for the date the relevant English company grants the
floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral agreement’’
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge
will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a
floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically
invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, whether the relevant English company is
solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by any of the English companies in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must
be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the
above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent
security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be
obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant
legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for
each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be
most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the
directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found
as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English company or over shares of an English company are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at
the discretion of the court.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by an English
company, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account Bank’’) may hold a
right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Account Charge)
to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the
relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged
under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed
charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the

234


-----

relevant English company) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will
no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s
liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English company may be
able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign guarantor which is liable
to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to England and Wales could
also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the
second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in
England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents
have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.Before the court
considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of
the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in
respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors
that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the
scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number
representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of
creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding
on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those
who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing
where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the scheme.

**_Priority of claims_**

One of the primary functions of administration and liquidation under English law is to realize the assets of
the insolvent company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the
Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds
from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out
below. With the exception of the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’ (see ‘‘—Prescribed part’’ below), distributions cannot
be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in
full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets
are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- **First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets**
covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession
(but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which
they have a proprietary interest;

- **Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of**
priority in which expenses are paid);

- **Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts**
owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension
schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has
been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and
(d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (‘‘FSCS’’) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank
equally. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation
under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the
discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, secondary preferential debts
rank equally;

235


-----

- **Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This**
would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it
but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing
asset realisations to the holders of any floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must,
subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

- **Fifth ranking:**

    - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under
section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to
the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In the case of any
unsecured shortfall for secured creditors, the insolvency officeholder is not permitted to
make a distribution from the Prescribed Part to such secured creditors unless the Prescribed
Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors;

    - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate
and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or
after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing
administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or
the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient
realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

    - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are
fully paid; and

- **Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining**
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene
the Insolvency Act).

**_Prescribed part_**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for
the benefit of unsecured creditors (the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’). Under current law, this applies to 50% of the
first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed
Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. The Prescribed Part must be made available to
unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to
creditors. As noted above, the Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured
creditors.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts,
the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate
for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the
relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

**Spain**

Under Spanish law, the guarantees and the security interests must guarantee or secure a primary obligation
and therefore, they have an ancillary nature. Due to this, they would be declared null, void and/or
terminated if the principal obligation is declared null, void and/or terminated. Any transfer of the principal
obligation carries along with it the transfer of the security interest. Additionally, the transfer of the security
interest itself cannot be done independently from the principal obligation due to its accessory nature. In
the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid
guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s
obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a
guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or

236


-----

partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and
may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured
obligations. Therefore, the primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security
agreement.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were
of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration,
a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and
cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the
Spanish Civil Code.

A Spanish company must have a corporate interest in granting the security interest. It is difficult to
determine whether or not a corporate benefit is obtained when granting the so-called upstream security
interests. Some factors may be considered, such as the receipt by the Spanish company of the funds (even
indirectly) or the actual benefit that the Spanish company receive from the financing. The absence of a
corporate interest may lead to the creditors of the Spanish company to contest, on the grounds of
Section 1,111 of the Spanish Civil Code, acts carried out by the Spanish company implying fraud of the
creditors’ rights. In addition, directors’ liability may be triggered. See ‘‘Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’._

In particular, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to grant
security interests over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled
case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a
security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other
companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified
from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company.
Therefore, as stated in section ‘‘Insolvency laws’’ below, guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor
of other group companies may be challenged on the basis that such guarantees have no consideration
unless evidence could be provided that there was a tangible and identifiable economic interest for the
Spanish companies (beyond an abstract group interest). Whether there is a specific consideration in favor
of the guarantor for the granting of the guarantee, is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case
by case basis. The lack of proof in that regard, may entail, if the guarantee is challenged, that a judge
declares the guarantee null and/or void.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades an´onimas)
in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company,
and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the
acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore,
guarantees or security interests granted by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not
extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such
Spanish subsidiary or the shares or its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of
their group, to the extent that such guarantee or security interest would constitute unlawful financial
assistance within the meaning of Articles 150 and 143 of the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital)._
This limitation would also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt although this is widely debated
between academics. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, any guarantee or security
interest granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for
unlawful financial assistance purposes. For example, where proceeds from the Notes are used to refinance
the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the value of the Guarantee granted by Saloni would be limited to the
portion of Senior Secured Bridge Facilities not used to fund our acquisition of Saloni.

In addition, and whilst this remains debatable, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish
Guarantors relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital
preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Guarantee. Such limitation,
_inter alia, may be referred to the net equity, net assets or share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or even_
the portion of the proceeds of the Notes used directly or indirectly to pay or refinance obligations of the
Spanish Guarantor.

**_First demand guarantee_**

The structure of first demand guarantees is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code but their
validity and effectiveness have been reviewed in several judgments and defined by the Spanish Supreme
Court (Tribunal Supremo) as autonomous guarantees, detached from the underlying agreement whose
obligations are being guaranteed. These judgments acknowledge the validity of provisions pursuant to
which guarantors waive the ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those stated under the
guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with
certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or
abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the event where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent
manner or in bad faith. Certain case law has also admitted that the guarantor can stay enforcement by
showing that there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of proof), usually
through a motion for declaratory relief filed by the guarantor.

**_Enforcement_**

Under Spanish law, a secured party may not appropriate the collateral subject to a security interest, nor
dispose of such collateral as it deems fit; the so-called ‘‘pacto comisorio’’ (or appropriation of collateral by
the creditor) is prohibited as a general rule. Because of this prohibition, a creditor must initiate the
enforcement of the security interest and use as payment of the debt the proceeds obtained in the sale of
the collateral in a public auction or through certain other proceedings aimed at ensuring that fair value is
obtained from the enforcement process. These proceedings are monitored either by a court or a notary
public, depending on the type of proceeding. The only applicable exceptions to the prohibition of the
‘‘pacto comisorio’’ are the following:

- financial collateral arrangements: Royal Decree-Law 5/2005, of March 11, 2005 (‘‘RDL 5/2005’’),
which implements in Spain Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
June 6, 2002, on financial collateral arrangements, regulates, among other matters, financial collateral
arrangements. RDL 5/2005 regulates the two following types of financial collateral arrangements: title
transfer collateral arrangements (acuerdos de garant´ıa financiera con cambio de titularidad) and
security financial collateral arrangements (acuerdos de garant´ıa pignoraticia) (i.e. pledges over cash or
securities); and

- pledges of credit rights: As an exception to the general rule that requires the enforcement of pledges
through a public auction, pledges over credit rights may be ‘‘foreclosed’’ by way of set-off since the
pledged credit rights or receivables are considered ‘‘liquid’’ (i.e. credit rights arising from the relevant
bank accounts and receivables). In other words, the asset does not need to be ‘‘realized’’ into money
because it is precisely the right to claim an amount of money such as the balance of a bank account or
the right to receive payment of the receivable.

Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive
summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain,
having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).

The terms ‘‘enforceable,’’ ‘‘enforceability,’’ ‘‘valid,’’ ‘‘legal,’’ ‘‘binding’’ and ‘‘effective’’ (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are
of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be
enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any
event be subject to:

- the nature of the remedies available; and

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of
law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

**_Parallel debt/Security agent_**

Spanish law does not recognize the concept of ‘‘security agent’’ holding security on behalf of a syndicate of
lenders or parallel debt structures, and there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would
recognize the authority of a security agent (including the Security Agent) and whether this would cause
delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in
the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent,

238


-----

the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security
Agent’s actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent (such as the
Security Agent) would only be entitled to enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the
other secured parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the
secured parties through the Security Agent, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent, may be
subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties (e.g., lenders and the
holders of the notes) in favor of the Security Agent for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (and, if
applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961). Regardless of
the authority that may be conferred upon the security agent under the relevant financing framework
agreement, such agent will need to prove that it is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by
means of duly notarized and apostilled powers of attorney by all lenders in its favor.

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the
Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has
not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not
expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not
hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes may be challenged.

- The concept of ‘‘parallel debt’’ may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any
court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court.

_Enforcement Proceedings in Spain_

Creditors are entitled to initiate actions under the following three types of proceedings: (i) the so-called
declarative proceeding (juicio declarativo) provided for under the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000, of
January 7, 2000 (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil); (ii) the executive proceeding (juicio
_ejecutivo) provided for under the same Spanish regulation; and (iii) the procedure managed by notaries to_
enforce guarantees under article 1872 of the Spanish Civil Code, which must be jointly interpreted with the
Notary Public Law of 28 May 1862 (the ‘‘Notarial Law’’) that establishes the requisites to be met by the
mentioned notary public auction system regulated in the Spanish Civil Code. The aforementioned
procedures are aimed at selling the relevant asset in a public auction monitored either by a Court or by a
notary public if the debtor does not verify payment of the amount due prior to the public auction. As for
first demand guarantees, either declarative proceedings or executive proceedings (if the guarantee is
granted in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Act 1/2000) could be used to enforce payment
from the guarantor.

The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in the
Notarial Law was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of 2 July on voluntary jurisdiction
(‘‘Law 15/2015’’). There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this new legal framework given that
some provisions of the Notarial Law seem be in conflict with laws on the enforcement of pledges that were
not expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open to
interpretation.

The recognition by Spanish courts of security interests created abroad will be governed by Spanish law.
Generally, such security interests will be upheld provided that the security interests are not contrary to
Spanish public policy (orden p´ublico). Once this test is met, the Spanish courts should not re-characterize
or otherwise amend the security interest to conform it to security interests regulated by Spanish law.

After the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of in rem securities (e.g., mortgages, pledges)
affecting assets owned by the debtor and necessary for the continuity of its professional or business
activities (presumably most of the debtor’s assets) will be stayed until the first of the following
circumstances occurs: (i) approval of a creditors’ agreement (unless the content has been approved by the
favorable vote of the creditor secured by the security, in which case the creditor will be bound to whatever
has been agreed in the creditors’ agreement), or (ii) one year has elapsed since the declaration of
insolvency without liquidation proceedings having been initiated.

Pursuant to Spanish law, the creation of pledges requires the fulfillment of certain formalities in order for
such security interests to be considered existing and perfected. ‘‘Ordinary’’ pledges (which may be created
over shares/quotas, credit rights arising from contracts, etc.), for instance, require the transfer of
possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee, and their formalization in a notarial document (which is
not compulsory in all cases but habitual and advisable in order for the security interest to be effective

239


-----

vis-`a-vis third parties). The specific way to fulfill the request of transfer of possession varies depending on
the nature of the assets to be pledged.

In respect of pledges over credit rights arising from contracts or bank deposits/accounts, the transfer of
possession requirement is met by formalizing such pledge in a notarial document and the pledge is typically
notified to the relevant debtor/depositary bank. Hence, the formalizing of the pledge and (although not
strictly and legally required) the notice to the relevant debtor/depositary bank would suffice for the
purposes of creating this security.

_Insolvency laws_

Any insolvency proceedings against Keraben and Saloni would be likely based on Spanish insolvency laws.
However, pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings and the Spanish Act 22/2003, of July 9, 2003, on Insolvency (the
‘‘Spanish Insolvency Act’’), where a Spanish company conducts business in another country, the jurisdiction
of the Spanish courts may be limited if the company’s center of main interest is found to be in a country
other than the Kingdom of Spain. This ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is deemed to be where the insolvent
party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by
third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ are
considered ‘‘the principal insolvency proceedings’’ and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the
insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of
Spain. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent
establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the
‘‘territorial insolvency proceedings’’).

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Spanish Insolvency Act.

The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as ‘‘concurso de
acreedores,’’ applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the
Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation
of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (composition agreement) or to the liquidation of the
debtor’s assets.

Both the debtor and creditors may initiate the insolvency proceeding. Bankruptcy is considered voluntary
(concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor and involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party
creditor.

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the insolvency petition upon inability to
regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for
such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due. It
is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the
circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor
fails to file a petition for insolvency within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the
directors may be removed from office and substituted by an insolvency authority once the insolvency is
declared and the insolvency process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of
action (including, inter alia, the possibility of submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and (iii) the
directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the
debtor be liquidated and insolvency be classified as ‘‘guilty.’’

The general obligation to file for insolvency within two months from the date of being in a situation of
current insolvency (insolvencia actual) does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has
initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain accessions to a pre-arranged anticipated composition
agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or to reach an out-of-court refinancing agreement set out in
Section 71 bis.1 or in the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the so-called 5 bis
communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, the debtor gains a three-month period
to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement
and one further month to file for insolvency, if after the above mentioned period of three months has
elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of
time, creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and enforcement will be prevented: (i) by
creditors, other than public, over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business
activities; and (ii) by financial creditors referred to in the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish
Insolvency Act over any asset, provided financial creditors holding at least 51% of the financial

240


-----

indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence negotiations in
order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or continue enforcement
proceedings against the debtor. Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above
categories that was commenced before the filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended.

Creditors may file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor but must provide evidence of its actual
and not just its imminent insolvency. To this end, creditors must prove to the court: (i) a generalized
default on payments by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the
debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, ‘‘fire sale,’’ hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s
assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the
applicable statutory period (i.e. three months). However, creditors having acquired debt by means of inter
_vivos acts and by a singular title after becoming due and payable may not file for the declaration of_
insolvency of the debtor within six months of the date of the debt acquisition.

Creditors must communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal) within one
month from the publication of the judicial resolution declaring the insolvency of the debtor in the Official
Gazette (Bolet´ın Oficial del Estado), by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. In
addition, the insolvency trustee is obliged to include all creditors appearing in the corporate
documentation of the debtor in the list of creditors to be attached to the insolvency trustee’s report, even if
such creditors did not communicate their claims to the insolvency trustee.

The sole declaration of insolvency does not imply the automatic suspension of the business activities of the
debtor. The insolvency court can either determine that the debtor continues to be managed by its
management body under the supervision of one or three insolvency trustees, or that the management body
loses control over the debtor, in which case the insolvency trustees will take over the full management of
the debtor.

The debtor may not carry out any management activity or enter into any new transactions concerning the
disposal of its assets, unless approved by either the insolvency trustee or the management body with the
authorization of the insolvency trustee, in both cases with the acquiescence of the insolvency court. Actions
carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be
declared null and void.

Neither private nor governmentally-led foreclosure proceedings can be initiated or continued against the
debtor’s assets after its declaration of insolvency. See the section ‘‘Enforcement Proceedings in Spain’’ for
any details on the exceptions to the foregoing.

Set-off is not allowed under the Spanish Insolvency Act once a debtor has been declared insolvent, but
where the operating requirements of set-off are met before the declaration of insolvency, set-off can still
apply. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-`a-vis the insolvent company if the
law governing the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it during insolvency
proceedings. Accrual of both legal and contractual interest is suspended from the declaration of the
insolvency except for those credits secured with in rem security up to the maximum amount covered by the
relevant security.

The general rule is the maintenance of all contracts entered into by the debtor from which obligations
derive for both parties that are still outstanding, regardless of the declaration of insolvency or the existence
of an early termination for insolvency clause in the relevant contract (which shall be deemed as not
included within the agreement). Contracts can be terminated if one of the parties breaches its contractual
obligations, although the court, even existing a termination cause, may force the fulfillment of the contract
if it is in the interest of the debtor’s estate. Contracts can also be terminated if the insolvency trustees
deem it convenient for the debtor’s estate upon approval of the insolvency court. In addition, the
insolvency trustees and, under certain circumstances, other creditors may seek the termination of certain
acts and contracts harmful to the debtor’s estate by initiating a claw-back action (see further details below).
There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt
with by the insolvency court.

The judge’s insolvency resolution contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them
within a one-month period, by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such
documentation provided by the creditors and that held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws up a list
of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as
follows: (i) claims against the debtor’s state, (ii) claims benefiting from special privileges, (iii) claims
benefitting from general privileges, (iv) ordinary claims and (v) subordinated claims.

241


-----

(a) Claims against the insolvency estate (cr´editos contra la masa) are not considered part of the debtor’s
general debt and are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other
debts under insolvency proceedings). Debt against the insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain
amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain
amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding
obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to
return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those that
derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the
insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith),
(v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the
insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by
the debtor in the ordinary course of business following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) in case of
liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a composition agreement (convenio) in
accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, (viii) 50% of the new funds lent under a
refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71. bis or
the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act. This classification shall not apply to the new
funds lent by the debtor or persons being in a special relationship with the debtor resulting from a share
capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose.

(b) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially _in rem_
_security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem_
securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the
creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured
asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior
claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature
of the claim. These claims may entail separate proceedings, and are subject to certain restrictions related
to a mandatory waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in
the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided that the relevant asset is necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s
business. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended
under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against
the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to composition
agreements (convenios), unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the arrangement or, in
case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or
75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the
same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to
collect payment against the secured assets.

(c) Claims benefiting from general privileges including, among others, certain labor debts and certain
debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and
social security obligations are recognized as privileged for half of their amount, and so is 50% of the
amount of the debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the
extent such application has been approved. New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in
compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71. bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish
Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (cr´edito contra la masa)
will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to be affected by the
restructuring (if under a composition agreement) except if they give their express support by voting in
favor of the composition agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors
holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the
conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of
the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and,
in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law) and with
the exception of secured assets, from which payments will be collected first by the relevant creditors
holding claims with a special privilege.

(d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a prorated basis from
the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and
generally privileged claims.

(e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue
of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In the
case of individuals, this includes their relatives. In the case of a legal entity, this includes directors (whether

242


-----

duly appointed or ‘‘de facto’’ acting as such—administradores de hecho-) and those holding general powers
of attorney (including those that have held those positions during the two years prior to the insolvency
declaration); group companies and their common shareholders, and any shareholders holding over 5% (for
listed companies) or 10% (for non-listed companies) of the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the
above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors
pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Section 71 _bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as_
being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the
financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are
presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place
within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Claims related to accrued and
unpaid interest unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right are also subordinated.
Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they may not vote on a composition agreement
(convenio) and in the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the
Spanish Insolvency Act (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

Once the insolvency proceeding is instituted, the harmful actions to the debtor’s estate carried out by the
debtor within two years prior to the date of declaration of the insolvency proceeding may be declared
rescinded (rescindido) or clawed back. Some transactions are presumed detrimental to the debtor’s estate
without the parties being able to provide evidence to the contrary, non-rebuttable presumptions,
(e.g., disposal of assets without consideration and payment of non-matured unsecured obligations). In
some cases, the prejudice is presumed although such presumption can be challenged (rebuttable
presumption) as in the case of (i) disposal acts in favor of specially-related persons to the debtor; (ii) the
granting of in rem rights as security for preexisting obligations (or new obligations in substitution of the
preexisting obligations); or (iii) early repayment of secured obligations. In the remaining cases, detriment
would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary
course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions,
(ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of
values and derivative instruments, (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in
favor of the labor authorities, and (iv) transactions subject to foreign law in case the beneficiary of the
transaction can prove that such transaction cannot be rescinded under the law to which it is subject to.

The Spanish Insolvency Act excludes as well certain types of refinancing agreements from the scope of
claw-back actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted in execution of such agreements
as explained in the section referred to as ‘‘Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain’’
below.

On top of claw-back actions, acts and contracts entered into by the debtor in fraud of creditors within the
last four years may be judicially challenged (through the so-called ‘‘actio pauliana’’).

If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together
with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor,
the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the
time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith,
the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be
classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith,
the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and
rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts.

The foreclosure of a security interest under the different proceedings set forth in the Spanish Civil
Procedure Law (e.g., judicial or notarial auction) does not guarantee -at least in practice- that the proceeds
to be obtained as a result of the enforcement proceeding are equivalent to the amount secured by such
asset or even to the value on the asset.

Enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in
excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under condition less favorable than those applicable
to the principal debtor.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other
group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests

243


-----

may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there
was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security
(beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or
the so-called ‘‘group interest’’). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the
guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by
case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees.

_Conclusion of insolvency_

_Settlement_

Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Act encourages
creditors to reach a composition agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. Such an agreement
may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors, and shall set forth how, when and up to what
amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the composition agreement must be honored by the
debtor and respected by the creditors.

The composition agreement must contain proposals for write-offs and stays. Article 100 of Spanish
Insolvency Act provides that it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for
certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of credits into shares, into
profit-sharing credits, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from
the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets related to the
debtor’s business activity to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity
and to pay off the debt as determined in the composition agreement.

The proposals in the composition agreement shall include a payment schedule.

In order for a composition agreement to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities
shall be met at the creditors’ meeting:

(a) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the
claims; to stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period not
exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration
or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans (pr´estamos
_participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of the ordinary claims have voted in favor of such_
composition agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will suffice when the
composition agreement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary claims within a period not exceeding
three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less
than 20%.

(b) In case the composition agreement contains stays of between five and ten years; write-offs of more
than 50% of the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the
public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit-participating loans
over the same period and any other proposal under article 100 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, 65% of
the ordinary credits should have voted for the composition agreement.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are
not entitled to vote.

Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved composition agreement (unless
they have expressly voted in its favor), the effects of an approved composition agreement can be extended
to privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition agreement has been approved by the
following majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors,
financial creditors or others):

(a) In case the composition agreement contains a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50%
of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into profit
participating loans, also for a period no longer than 5 years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have
voted in favor; and

(b) In case the composition agreement contains a write-off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for a
period between 5 and 10 years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a period

244


-----

between 5 and 10 years, and any other proposal under article 100 of the Insolvency Act, at least 75%
of privileged creditors have voted in favor.

_Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements in Spain_

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts) can also be
judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct an eventual
insolvency proceedings of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into
such refinancing agreements, provided that, among other requirements, (i) they entail a significant
enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either granting a longer term or
replacing previous claims with new ones, all these in accordance with a viability plan enabling the
continuity of the debtor business activity in the short and medium term; (ii) they have been subscribed by
creditors holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether
or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish Insolvency Act excludes public creditors,
labor creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds
are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate
acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, the
majority refers both individually to each company and to the Group as a whole -where the intercompany
claims are not taken into account-); and (iv) the refinancing agreement and the documents sustaining
performance of conditions (i) to (iii) above are formalized in a notarial deed. Such judicially sanctioned
refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw-back action, but may be challenged in certain cases
pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law (i.e., in case of breach of formalities or in case they impose
disproportionate sacrifices on dissenting creditors—see below).

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an
interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement (for the
purposes of petitioning protection against clawback) if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the
liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on dissenting or
non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that
part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in
accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided they achieve
the thresholds mentioned below:

(a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60%
of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt
converted into so-called profit participation loans (pr´estamos participativos) of duration up to five
years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the
debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) uncapped haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing
agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may
choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a discharge of
their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota
shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for
equity swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking,
maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio
_pro soluto)._

245


-----

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors in the amount covered by their security interest (valued in accordance with the
rules set out in the Fourth Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act), when the agreement
has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the
value of all secured claims of the debtor.

_Liquidation_

Failure to obtain the approval of a composition agreement or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to
liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a composition agreement has been
approved, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations
undertaken after the approval of such composition agreement. Additionally, in such case, if the debtor
does not file a petition for liquidation while the composition agreement is in force, any creditor may file
such petition based on Article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Therefore, the company will be aimed at
dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due
and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits.

The insolvency trustee will be required to prepare a liquidation plan that must be approved by the
insolvency court. The insolvency trustee is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year
to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a different
insolvency trustee.

_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_

Article 176.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceeding at
any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied
by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the impossibility to face payment obligations
regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that article 176 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Act foresees the termination of the
insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as no
future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming liability to third parties, nor the assessment of
the proceeding as guilty.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to insolvency claw back action, the insolvency administrator and any
creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acci´on rescisoria pauliana) against the
debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is
performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in
any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following
requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

- the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place
after such debt was created;

- the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

- such act was fraudulent;

- there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

- debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements
under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed (as opposed to claw back actions where the
subjective component or fraud does not have to be proven). Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil
Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers
for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or
whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered
fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a _iuris et de iure presumption (i.e. it cannot be_

246


-----

rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption
(i.e. it is a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor (or any other
debts that may be owed to other creditors). Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions
necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor.

If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the
third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages if it is proved that such third party incurred in
willful misconduct when entering into the fraudulent agreement with the debtor. In any other case (i.e. if it
is proved that the third party acted in good faith and was not aware of the debtor’s fraudulent intention) it
will be the person who has actually and consciously caused the damage to the creditor who will have to
reimburse the corresponding amount.

The deadline to file a rescission action expires after four years as from the date when the claim could have
been filed.

**Australia**

In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Australia under the insolvency laws
of Australia, the procedural and substantive provisions of which may differ from comparable provisions of
bankruptcy law or the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

There are three main forms of insolvency processes in Australia: voluntary administration (which may
result in a deed of company arrangement), receivership and winding-up (also called liquidation).
Corporate reorganizations can also be effected using, among other things, schemes of arrangement.

**_Voluntary Administration_**

Voluntary administration is a non-terminal insolvency process begun by the appointment of one or more
administrators to a company.

The most common method for appointment of an administrator is by resolution of the company’s board.
However, a creditor with a security interest over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s
property can also appoint an administrator, as can a liquidator or provisional liquidator (if the company is
already in liquidation or provisional liquidation). A company need not be presently insolvent to enter into
voluntary administration, however in the case of an appointment by the company’s board or a liquidator or
provisional liquidator, the appointer must believe that the company is likely to become insolvent at some
future time.

Voluntary administration is the only formal process in Australia with rehabilitation as one of its express
goals. During the period of voluntary administration, there is a moratorium on claims by the company’s
creditors, such that (with certain exceptions) no proceedings against the company, or in relation to the
company’s property, can be commenced or continued with, and no enforcement processes can begin or
proceed other than with the consent of the administrator or the relevant Australian Court.

Similarly, a security interest cannot be enforced over the property of the company except with the consent
of the administrator or the Court, unless the secured creditor holds a security interest over the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property and enforces the security interest within a 13 business
days following the appointment of the administrator. These restrictions may affect the enforceability of the
security interests granted by the Australian Guarantors if a voluntary administrator were appointed to
those entities.

The duration of voluntary administration is prescribed in the Australian Corporations Act and is intended
to be for a short period of time, although the administrator can seek an order from an Australian Court to
lengthen the period of the administration where the circumstances justify that course. During the period of
voluntary administration, the administrator controls the company (the powers of the directors and officers
are suspended). The administrator may carry on the business of the company and does so as the company’s
agent.

At the second creditors’ meeting, creditors will be asked to vote on whether the company should execute a
Deed of Company Arrangement if one is proposed (see below), be wound up (see below) or revert to the
control of its directors. That decision is made by the company’s creditors (by a majority in number and

247


-----

value) at a meeting convened by the administrator. If the vote is split between value and number, the
administrator which generally chairs the meeting of creditors has a casting vote on the outcome. The
voluntary administration ends when the company executes a Deed of Company Arrangement or the
creditors resolve that it be wound up or revert to the control of its directors.

**_Deed of Company Arrangement_**

A deed of company arrangement is a statutory instrument which, once executed, binds the company, its
officers, members, the deed’s administrators, its unsecured creditors (whether or not they voted in favor of
it), any secured creditors who vote in favor of it and any other parties to the document. Secured creditors
who do not vote in favor of the deed of company arrangement will generally not be bound by its terms.

The content of a deed of company arrangement will depend on the arrangement proposed which is put to
vote at a meeting of the company’s creditors at the second creditors’ meeting held during the voluntary
administration procedure. A deed of company arrangement will generally provide for the restructure or
rehabilitation of the company, usually by compromising claims against the company in exchange for a
distribution to creditors. It may also provide for the realization of assets, the orderly winding down of the
company’s business, the pursuit of litigation for the benefit of creditors and, as stated above, the
compromise of claims against the company. It will generally also provide for a moratorium on claims
against the company for the period in which the deed of company arrangement operates.

A deed of company arrangement can be terminated in accordance with its terms, by an order of the
relevant Australian Court, or by resolution of the company’s creditors.

The consequences of termination will depend on the terms of the deed or (if applicable) the Court orders
made or the creditors’ resolution. Two common consequences of termination are:

- that the company is wound up (for example, if the deed has not been performed, the Court makes
orders terminating the deed or the creditors pass a resolution terminating the deed and that the
company be wound up); or

- that the company returns to the control of its directors and officers (if the deed has been performed).

**_Receivership_**

Receivership is a form of non-terminal insolvency process, under which a receiver (or receiver and
manager) is appointed in respect of a company to take control of or get in specific property, so as to
protect the rights of a party (usually a secured creditor) entitled to that property. Receivers are generally
appointed privately by a secured creditor in accordance with the terms of a security document. In certain
limited circumstances, receivers may also be appointed by an Australian Court.

Depending on the extent of the assets securing the company’s obligation to the secured creditor and the
terms of the security, the secured creditor will usually have the ability to appoint either a receiver or a
receiver and manager. A receiver is charged with the realization or management of the secured asset over
which he or she has been appointed. Where the terms of the relevant security permit it to do so, a receiver
and manager may be empowered to take control of the debtor’s business as a going concern for the
purpose of repayment of the secured debt, through realization of the debtor’s assets and/or through the
income generated by the debtor’s business. For the purposes of this document, there is no distinction
between receivers and receivers and managers, so the term ‘‘receivers’’ is used to describe both types of
appointment.

A receiver’s powers are determined by the terms of the security under which she or he is appointed (or in
the case of a Court appointed receiver, the relevant Court orders). Receivers’ powers and obligations are
also subject to the Australian Corporations Act and general law. Generally, a receiver’s powers will include
the power to enter into possession and control of the secured property, lease or sell the property, and to
carry on the business of the debtor and do all things which the debtor is normally empowered to do. It is
common for the document creating the security interest to provide that receivers exercise their powers as
agent of the company. As such, while directors and officers of the debtor are not formally displaced by the
appointment of a receiver, the powers of the receiver supersede those of the existing company
management, in respect of dealing with secured property. The directors may however be required to
provide the receiver with reports as to the company’s affairs and to cooperate with the receiver to the
extent necessary to achieve the purposes of the receivership.

248


-----

A receivership can occur concurrently with a voluntary administration, deed of company arrangement or a
liquidation. Where a receivership occurs concurrently with a voluntary administration, the administrator’s
powers are subject to the functions and powers of the receiver. Where a receivership occurs concurrently
with a winding up (or liquidation), the receiver’s powers are not diminished, although there may be some
restrictions on the extent to which the receiver may exercise those powers.

A receiver owes her or his primary duty to the secured creditor who appointed them. However, the
Australian Corporations Act also imposes certain statutory duties on a receiver. In particular, s 420A(1) of
that Act, obliges receivers to take reasonable care to ensure that, if sold, the secured property is sold for
market value (or, if the assets do not have a market value, for the best price reasonably obtainable having
regard to the circumstances that exist when the property is sold). Receivers are also officers of the
company and therefore, are subject to the officers’ duties imposed by the Australian Corporations Act.

In the normal course, a privately-appointed receivership will terminate where the purpose for which the
receiver was appointed has been achieved. This will usually be the repayment of the debt owed to the
secured creditor. If there are insufficient assets held by the debtor to repay the secured debt in full, the
receivership will terminate when the receiver exhausts all of the available assets of the debtor and retires.
On termination of the receivership (assuming there is no concurrent voluntary administration, deed of
company arrangement or liquidation), control of the company and all of its remaining assets are returned
to the company’s directors and officers.

**_Winding Up_**

A winding-up (or liquidation) is a terminal insolvency process by which a company’s affairs are brought to
an end, and its assets are distributed among its creditors and (if there is a surplus after creditors are paid)
its members.

A winding up most commonly occurs where a company is insolvent, and is commenced:

- where a Court makes an order that the company be wound up in insolvency (or for some other
reason);

- by resolution of the company’s members (known as a creditors’ voluntary winding up if the company is
insolvent); or

- by resolution of the company’s creditors at the conclusion of a voluntary administration.

It is also possible for a company to be wound up on a solvent basis, most commonly because its members
wish it to cease trading and have their capital returned (known as a members’ voluntary winding up).

During a winding up:

- subject to Court order, a stay is imposed upon existing proceedings against the company and claimants
are prohibited from commencing new proceedings;

- instead claimants must lodge a proof of debt with the liquidator for the amount of their claim against
the company;

- any distress or execution put in force against the property of the company is void. However, a secured
creditor does not require the leave of the Court to deal with the charged property. Where a
receivership and liquidation occur concurrently, a liquidator will generally not have power to deal with
the company’s assets that are the subject of a valid security interest in favor of the secured creditor.

On liquidation, unsecured creditors have a right to vote at any creditors’ meetings and distribution of a
fund of assets protected and properly administered. Secured creditors generally retain the right to enforce
their security and may elect to appoint a receiver.

Once appointed, a liquidator is able to bring proceedings, amongst other things, against persons in relation
to ‘‘voidable transactions’’, pursuant to section 588FE(1) of the Australian Corporations Act. The most
commonly prosecuted ‘‘voidable transaction’’ claims, and their relevance to noteholders are discussed
further in the limitations section, below.

The proceeds of successful claims will be available for distribution to the company’s creditors.

Section 556(1) of the Australian Corporations Act provides a prescribed order (commonly referred to as a
‘‘waterfall’’) for the payment of certain unsecured debts and claims against the company, which must be

249


-----

paid in priority to all other unsecured debts and claims against the company. These include, among others,
debts or amounts owing to employees for certain claims.

The final step in a winding-up is the deregistration of the company. The steps for deregistration are
governed by the Australian Corporations Act. Once deregistered, the company ceases to exist and the
liquidator’s role comes to an end.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a Court approved compromise or arrangement between a company and its
creditors or members, or a specific class of creditors (for creditors’ schemes) or members (for members’
schemes).

Schemes can be utilized by companies to provide for a modification or adjustment of the rights of the
company’s creditors or members which, if approved by the requisite majority of creditors or members of
the class to which the scheme was proposed and approved by the Court, will be binding on all creditors or
members in that class (including dissenting creditors or members).

Members’ schemes will generally involve some restructuring of the company and the rights and obligations
of its members. A creditors’ scheme will often involve a proposal to defer, compromise or extinguish the
company’s debts. A typical scenario would involve a moratorium in respect of claims against the company
and a compromise of debts owed by it (and/or a modification of the rights of creditors or a class of them in
relation to the company). A creditors’ scheme needs to be approved by each class of affected creditors (in
each case by a voting majority constituting 75% in value and majority in number). Unlike a deed of
company arrangement, schemes of arrangement can bind secured creditors, owners and lessors in respect
of their property and can release third-party claims.

Schemes are, however, extremely flexible and can be utilized to implement any arrangement relating to the
rights and obligations of the company and its creditors. However, a scheme which is contrary to law, or not
in the public interest is unlikely to be approved by the Court (even if it has the support of members and/or
creditors).

**_Summary of Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Collateral Under Australian_**
**_Law_**

_General_

Under Australian law, the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and security interests is subject to
various limitations, some of which are summarized below.

_Breach of Directors’ Duties_

The decision to provide the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests may be found to have been in
breach of the duties owed by the directors of the Australian Guarantors, including the duty to act in good
faith in the interests of the Australian guarantors, and for a proper purpose.

If a Court were to find that the directors of the Australian Guarantors breached those duties in connection
with providing the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests, they may become voidable.

If any of the Guarantees from an Australian Guarantor is avoided, it is possible that Noteholders would be
left with a claim solely against the Company and the other Guarantors.

_Risks Relating to Registration_

Under the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) (the ‘‘PPSA’’), security interests over personal
property (as that term is defined in the PPSA) may be susceptible to a loss of priority (or in certain
circumstances extinguishment) unless the security interest has attached to the relevant collateral and has
been perfected. Perfection will usually occur upon registration of the security interest on the Personal
Property Securities Register within the requisite timeframe (but can also be effected by ‘‘possession’’ or
‘‘control’’ of the relevant collateral). If a security interest is not perfected or is extinguished, a secured
party will continue to have an unsecured claim against a grantor upon the appointment of a voluntary
administrator or a liquidator to the grantor.

The PPSA also sets out detailed rules for priority between security interests over personal property and for
the circumstances in which assets may become free from security interests. To the extent to which the

250


-----

security interests granted by the Australian Guarantors are created over personal property, these rules will
apply. The general rule is that security interests rank in order of perfection subject to a number of
exceptions, which have general application. For example, a security interest perfected by ‘‘control’’ ranks
ahead of other security interests and a purchase money security interest can rank ahead of earlier
perfected security interests provided it is registered within a certain time.

_Risks Arising in a Winding-Up_

_Voidable transactions_

If an Australian guarantor is subject to a winding up, the liquidator may apply to an Australian Court for
orders that the entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests or a transaction in connection
with the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests constitutes a voidable transaction and should be set
aside.

The most commonly brought voidable transactions claims include the following:

- an ‘‘unfair preference,’’ (section 588FA of the Australian Corporations Act) being a transaction
between the company and a creditor carried out at a time when the company was insolvent (or the
company became insolvent as a result of the transaction) that results in the creditor receiving from the
company, in respect of an unsecured debt, more than the creditor would receive on a winding up of
the company;

- an ‘‘uncommercial transaction,’’ (section 588FB of the Australian Corporations Act) being a
transaction that a reasonable person in the company’s position would not have entered into, having
regard to the benefits and detriment to the company of entering into the transaction, the benefits to
the other parties to the transaction of entering into it and any relevant matters; or

- an ‘‘unreasonable director-related transaction’’ or an ‘‘unfair loan’’ (sections 588FDA and 588FD,
respectively, of the Australian Corporations Act).

_‘‘Green’’ security_

A security interest granted by the company in respect of ‘‘circulating assets’’ in the 6 month period leading
up to the liquidator’s appointment, (or, if the liquidation was preceded by voluntary administration, the
commencement of the voluntary administration), will be void except so far as the security interest secures a
new advance (in each case) (other than an advance to discharge an unsecured debt owed to the secured
party which must be given as consideration for the circulating security interest), interest on such an
advance (in each case), the amount of a liability (e.g. under a guarantee) undertaken at or after that time
on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company, an amount payable for property services supplied to the
company at or after that time or interest on an amount so payable. The security interest will not be void if
the company is proven to have been solvent immediately after the time it granted the security interest.

_Impact of the above on entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests_

The extent to which the entry into the Notes Guarantees and/or security interests is susceptible to
challenge on the bases set out above depends, among other things, on when the relevant transaction was
entered into relative to the commencement of the winding up (or, if a voluntary administration precedes
the winding up, the commencement of the voluntary administration).

Different time periods apply depending on the circumstances of the relevant transaction and the identity of
the parties to it.

_Ipso facto reforms_

On 18 September 2017, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No.2) Act 2017 (the
‘‘TLA Act’’) was enacted in Australia. The legislation provides for a stay on enforcement of certain rights
arising under a contract (such as a right entitling a creditor to terminate the contract or to accelerate
payments or providing for automatic acceleration) for a certain period of time (and in some cases
indefinitely), if the reason for enforcement of those rights is the contractual counterparty being under
voluntary administration, a managing controller appointed over the whole or substantially the whole of its
property, or a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of it avoiding being wound up in insolvency) being
sought or applying to it (all of which are discussed above), or its financial position during those

251


-----

proceedings (known as ‘‘ipso facto’’ rights) or a reason in substance contrary to the TLA Act. The specified
proceedings do not include a winding up or liquidation.

The operation of the legislation commenced on 1 July 2018. The stay will apply to ipso facto rights arising
under contracts, agreements or arrangements entered into at or after the commencement date of the
legislation, subject to certain exclusions as set out in the TLA Act, subordinate regulations and a
Declaration related to the TLA Act that also came into effect on 1 July 2018. The subordinate regulations
prescribe that a right contained in a kind of contract, agreement or arrangement for the underwriting of an
issue, or sale, of bonds or that is, or governs, bonds, is not subject to the stay.

Rights exercised with the consent of the relevant administrator, managing controller, scheme administrator
(or a liquidator if a liquidation follows the administration or scheme) and the right to appoint a controller
(in respect of security over the whole or substantially the whole property) during the decision period
following the appointment of administrators are excluded. In addition to the exclusions currently
applicable as a result of related subordinate regulations and Declaration that came into effect on 1 July
2018, rights prescribed by regulations or Ministerial declarations following 1 July 2018 may also be
excluded. Any such subordinate legislation that may be implemented following 1 July 2018 may also
prescribe additional reasons to which the stay on enforcement applies. The legislation also gives the Court
the power to impose the stay or lift the stay in certain circumstances and extend the duration of the stay.

In relation to the Australian Guarantor, the effect of the ipso facto reforms means that, in the event of the
Australian Guarantor being subject to voluntary administration, a managing controllership over the whole
or substantially the whole of its property or a scheme of arrangement (for the purpose of avoiding it being
wound up in insolvency) but not winding up, the rights of any counterparty to a contract with the
Australian Guarantor that would otherwise be triggered by those events (or triggered by its financial
position whilst affected by one of those events) may be unenforceable for a certain period of time (or
potentially indefinitely). This may affect the exercise of rights under the Guarantees as against the
Australian Guarantor.

Until judicial consideration of the TLA Act, the subordinate regulations and the Declaration and any
changes in market practice, the scope of the ipso facto reform and its potential effect on the Notes and
Guarantees remains uncertain.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’). The Regulation S Global Notes will be
deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’ and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the
‘‘Global Notes’’). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interest’’ and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in
Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including
certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery
of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or
pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interest in the
Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the
Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or ‘‘holder’’ of the Notes under
the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depository for Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable (or its nominees) will be considered the holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under
the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and their respective agents, nor the
Trustee under the Indenture nor any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be
liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes (as defined below):

(a) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(b) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(c) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

253


-----

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
holders and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or
us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend
is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be
issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred
or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of A100,000
or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Registrar or an
Authenticating Agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note
if the Registrar’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee or Registrar may require a holder
requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the
judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the
Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive
Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent
a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the
Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer,
and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that
under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate
basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less A100,000 principal amount at maturity,
or less, may be redeemed in part.

254


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent
will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any Paying
Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
‘‘street name.’’

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer
Agent, Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of
a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting
from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be
subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the ‘‘Euroclear/Clearstream Holders’’) through
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of the notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their
respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its
interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and
in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

255


-----

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

After the expiration of the 40-day distribution period (as defined in Regulation S), beneficial interests in a
Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial
interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these
certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon
receipt by the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under
the U.S. Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in ‘‘Notice to Investors,’’ Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Transfer.’’ Any Book-Entry Interest in one of
the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in
the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and
accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Transfer’’ and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) a written certificate (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that
interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In
addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected
in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

256


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time
of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

257


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences,_
_under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including, without_
_limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or redemption of, the Notes_
_or any interest therein._

**United Kingdom**

_The following is a summary of the United Kingdom withholding taxation treatment and of certain other United_
_Kingdom taxation issues at the date hereof in relation to payments of principal and interest in respect of the_
_Notes. It is based on current law and published practice of HMRC, which may be subject to change, possibly_
_with retrospective effect. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners_
_of the Notes, and some aspects do not apply to some classes of persons, such as dealers in securities. The_
_following is a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It is not_
_intended as tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a_
_prospective purchaser of Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position_
_should consult their professional advisers. Prospective holders of the Notes who may be liable to taxation in_
_jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes are_
_particularly advised to consult their professional advisers as to whether they are so liable (and if so under the_
_laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only to certain United Kingdom taxation_
_aspects of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, holders should be aware that they may be liable to_
_taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such_
_payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the_
_United Kingdom._

**_UK Withholding Tax on UK Source Interest_**

The Notes will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’ provided they are and continue to be admitted to trading
on a multilateral trading facility operated by an EEA-regulated recognised stock exchange within the
meaning of sections 987 (as amended by the Finance Act 2018) and section 1005 of the Income Tax
Act 2007 (the ‘‘ITA’’). Whilst the Notes are and continue to be quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on
the Notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income
tax.

The International Securities Market is a multilateral trading facility operated by an EEA-regulated
recognized stock exchange (the London Stock Exchange) for these purposes.

If the Notes cease to constitute quoted Eurobonds, interest will generally be paid by the Issuer under
deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief as may be available
following a direction from HMRC pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty (a
‘‘Treaty’’), or to any other exemption which may apply.

**_Payments by Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the
Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) such payments may be subject to
UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to such relief as may be available under an
applicable Treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not be
eligible for the ‘‘quoted Eurobond’’ exemption described above.

In certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer and Guarantors (as applicable) will
be obliged to gross-up payments on the Notes to ensure that the holders of the Notes receive and retain a
net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding for
or on account of United Kingdom income tax been required. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts’’._

**_Provision of Information_**

Holders of Notes should note that where any interest on Notes is paid to them (or to any person acting on
their behalf) by the Issuer or any person in the United Kingdom acting on behalf of that Issuer (a ‘‘paying
**agent’’), or is received by any person in the United Kingdom acting on behalf of the relevant holder (save**
where such person is engaged solely in a passive role in the payment process, for example clearing or

258


-----

arranging the clearing of a check) (a ‘‘collecting agent’’), then the Issuer, the paying agent or the collecting
agent (as the case may be) may, in certain cases, be required to supply to HM Revenue & Customs details
of the payment and certain details relating to the holder (including the holder’s name and address). These
provisions will apply whether or not the interest has been paid subject to deduction or withholding for or
on account of United Kingdom income tax and whether or not the holder is resident in the United
Kingdom for United Kingdom taxation purposes. Where the holder is not so resident, the details provided
to HM Revenue & Customs may, in certain cases, be passed by HM Revenue & Customs to the tax
authorities of the jurisdiction in which the holder is resident for taxation purposes.

The provisions referred to above may also apply, in certain circumstances, to amounts paid on redemption
of the Notes if they constitute ‘‘deeply discounted securities’’ as defined in Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the
Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (‘‘ITTOIA 2005’’).

**_Other Rules Relating to United Kingdom Tax_**

(1) Where Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a
discount, then any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of
interest are subject to United Kingdom withholding tax as described above.

(2) The references in this section (‘‘Certain UK Taxation Considerations’’) to ‘‘interest’’, ‘‘premium’’ and
‘‘discount’’ above are to ‘‘interest’’, ‘‘premium’’ and ‘‘discount’’ as understood in United Kingdom tax
law. The statements above do not take any account of any different definitions of ‘‘interest’’,
‘‘premium’’ and ‘‘discount’’ which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the
terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation. Holders of the Notes should seek
their own professional advice as regards the withholding tax treatment of any payment on the Notes
which does not constitute ‘‘interest’’, ‘‘premium’’ and ‘‘discount’’ as those terms are understood in
United Kingdom tax law.

(3) The above description of the United Kingdom withholding tax position assumes that there will be no
substitution of an issuer and does not consider the tax consequences of any such substitution.

**_Further United Kingdom Taxation Issues_**

Interest on the Notes constitutes United Kingdom source income for tax purposes and may be subject to
United Kingdom tax by way of direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without
withholding or deduction. However, interest with a United Kingdom source received without withholding
or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax will not generally be chargeable to United
Kingdom tax on income in the hands of a holder of Notes (other than certain trustees) who is not resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom unless (a) that holder of Notes is a company which carries on a
trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom or, if not such a
company, carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency,
and (b) the interest is received in connection with, or the Notes are attributable to, that permanent
establishment, branch or agency. There are exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent
(such as some brokers and investment managers). The provisions of an applicable double taxation treaty
may also be relevant for such holders of the Notes.

**_United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers_**

In general, holders of Notes which are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax (including
non-resident holders whose Notes are used, held or acquired for the purpose of a trade carried on in the
United Kingdom through a permanent establishment) will be charged to tax as income on all returns,
profits or gains on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to currency fluctuations or
otherwise) in accordance with the ‘‘loan relationship’’ rules contained in Part 5 of the Corporation Tax
Act 2009 on a basis broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment.

**_Other United Kingdom Tax Payers_**

_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_

If the Notes constitute ‘‘deeply discounted securities’’ for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of
ITTOIA 2005 (as to which, see ‘‘—Taxation of Discount’’ below), the Notes should also constitute
‘‘qualifying corporate bonds’’ within the meaning of Section 117 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains
Act 1992, with the result that on a disposal of the Notes neither chargeable gains nor allowable losses

259


-----

should arise for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of capital gains. If the Notes are not ‘‘deeply
discounted securities’’, they will fall outside the definition of ‘‘qualifying corporate bond’’ mentioned
above. Where the Notes do not constitute ‘‘qualifying corporate bonds’’, any disposal of such a Note by an
individual holder who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade,
profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which such a Note is
attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of United Kingdom tax on
chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances.

_Accrued Income Profits_

On a disposal of Notes by a holder of Notes, any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment
date or such amount as HMRC deems just and reasonable may be chargeable to tax as income under the
rules relating to accrued income profits as set out in Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if that holder of
Notes is resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United
Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. These provisions will not apply if
the Notes are deemed to be ‘‘deeply discounted securities’’ (as to which, see ‘‘—Taxation of Discount’’
below).

_Taxation of Discount_

Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued, or, in certain cases,
the premium (if any) payable on redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute ‘‘deeply discounted
securities’’ for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the ITTOIA 2005. If the Notes are deemed to
constitute deeply discounted securities, individual holders of the Notes who are resident for tax purposes in
the United Kingdom or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a
branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable generally will be liable to United Kingdom income
tax on any gain realized on the sale or other disposal (including redemption) of the Notes; however, such
holders will not be able to claim relief from United Kingdom income tax in respect of costs incurred on the
acquisition, transfer or redemption of, or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption of, the Notes.
Holders of Notes are advised to consult their own professional advisers if they require any advice or
further information relating to ‘‘deeply discounted securities’’.

_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_

No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on the issue or transfer of the
Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for
the discussion of FATCA (as defined under ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act’’), and does not
address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and
gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the ‘‘Treasury
**Regulations’’), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof,**
and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed
below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not
be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions,
U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies,
traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities
and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that are resident in
or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes

260


-----

as part of a ‘‘straddle’’, ‘‘hedge’’, ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated transaction, entities covered
by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of
gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In
addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their
‘‘issue price’’ (i.e. the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash,
excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or
any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of
which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within
the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is
in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in
such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income**
**tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign or other**
**tax laws.**

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a
U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with
such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at
such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect
to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will
be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or,
with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the
partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual
period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on
the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days
of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the
prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.
The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be
changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest
income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar

261


-----

value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss
generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as
U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notes
will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds its issue price (as
defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally,
0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the
issue date).

In the event the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of Notes generally will be required to include
such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis
under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the
receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the
‘‘daily portions’’ of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in
which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any
‘‘accrual period’’ a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note
may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is
no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or
last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the
excess of (i) the product of the Note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of such accrual period and its
‘‘yield to maturity,’’ determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and
properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such
accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its
issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is
the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to
be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into
U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph
under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included
in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment
received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar
value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts
on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of
previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual
periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and
prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the
Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or
loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for
foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest
income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (and OID, if any) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to
U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a
U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu
of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding
period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim

262


-----

foreign tax credits. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility
of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such
disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as
interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and
such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder,
increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a Note
purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase
price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an
established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis
taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on
the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note
that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so
elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by
translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special
election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on
an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the
U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does
not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there
are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest
income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’ or
‘‘—Original Issue Discount,’’ as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss
(including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain
or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will
be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are
generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

263


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the accrual of
OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when
required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the
U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject
to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to
losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. holders who are individuals and who own ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate value
in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an
information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does
not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of
limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related
tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The
Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements,
unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an
entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as ‘‘FATCA’’), a
‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain ‘‘foreign passthru payments’’
made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain
U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final
regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution,
FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments
have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected
to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the
Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes,
there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE
INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations**

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a guarantor of the Notes makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such
payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available
under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply.
It is not certain that such payments by a guarantor of the Notes will be eligible for all exemptions described
above.

of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account or accounts for which you are
purchasing the Rule 144A Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the
date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) that is one year after the later of the date of the
original issue and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or
any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared
effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to

in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act or
(v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
your or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable
local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and the trustee’s rights prior to any such offer,
sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification
and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to
require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing in the Indenture is completed and delivered
by the transferor to the Registrar or Transfer Agent (as applicable). The foregoing restrictions on
resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE
U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR THE

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(6) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions
on the transfer of such Notes.

(7) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the
Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(8) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any
Notes acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Registrar that

acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent that you
have sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that you have full
power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account.

(10) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by us
or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the
Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under ‘‘Plan of Distribution.’’

**ERISA Considerations**

Any purchaser, including, without limitation, any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of (i) an employee benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(‘‘ERISA’’)) subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or a plan, individual
retirement account or other arrangement to which Section 4975 of the Code applies (each, a ‘‘Plan’’),
(ii) an entity whose underlying assets include ‘‘plan assets’’ (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101 as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA or any applicable Similar Laws (as defined
below)) with respect to a Plan by reason of a Plan’s investment in such entity or otherwise (each, a ‘‘Benefit
**Plan Investor’’) or (iii) a governmental (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church (as defined in**
Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) or non-U.S. plan (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) or other arrangement that is subject to any Federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code (‘‘Similar Laws’’),
transferee or holder of the Notes will be deemed to have represented, agreed and acknowledged (as
applicable) in its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that:

(a) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein, (1) either
(A) it is not, and it is not acting directly or indirectly on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such

267


-----

Notes or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting directly or indirectly on behalf of), a
Plan, a Benefit Plan Investor or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is
subject to Similar Laws, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire or hold such
Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any such Plan, Benefit Plan Investor or
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to Similar Laws, or (B) (i)
its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein does not and will not
constitute or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Part 4 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan or other arrangement, a violation of any applicable Similar Laws); and (ii) if it is or is
acting directly on behalf of a Plan or Benefit Plan Investor subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code, then it will be required or deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (a) none of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee (the ‘‘Transaction Parties’’), nor any of
their affiliates, has provided or undertaken to provide any impartial investment recommendation or
investment advice on which the Plan, or Benefit Plan Investor, or any fiduciary or other person
investing the assets of the Plan, or Benefit Plan Investor (‘‘Plan Fiduciary’’), has relied in connection
with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise acting as a fiduciary, as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, in connection with the Plan, or Benefit
Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Notes and (b) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent
judgment in evaluating the transaction; and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any
interest therein other than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the
applicable Indenture, certified) to make these same representations, warranties and agreements with
respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein.

(b) The acquirer and any fiduciary or representative acting in a fiduciary capacity causing it to acquire an
interest in any Notes agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee and/or their respective affiliates, from and against any cost, damage or loss
incurred by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and/or any of their
respective affiliates, as applicable, as a result of any of the foregoing representations and agreements
being or becoming false.

(c) Any purported acquisition or transfer of any Note or beneficial interest therein to a purchaser or
transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be void ab initio.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement dated as of, 2018, among
the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’), we have agreed to sell
to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from
us, together with all other Initial Purchasers, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of A450.0 million as
follows:

**Principal Amount**
**Initial Purchasers** **of the Notes**

**General**

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may from
time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales in the United States may be made
through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain
limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is
60 days after the date hereof, we will not, and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent
provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt
securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the
Notes.

**Securities Not Being Registered Under the U.S. Securities Act**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States to persons that are not
U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used
in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales
of the Notes are restricted as described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**United Kingdom**

Each Initial Purchaser represents warrants and agrees that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us or the Guarantors; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

269


-----

**EEA**

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold, distributed or
otherwise made available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make available any Notes to any
retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision:

(1) the expression ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or

(2) the expression ‘‘offer’’ includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe to the Notes.

**Other Jurisdictions**

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes.
See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**Resale Restriction**

We and the Guarantors have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to
cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied to list the
Notes on the International Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange, however, we cannot assure
you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchaser
without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There may not be
_an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.’’_

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as
such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of
the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + ’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the
U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade

270


-----

the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following business days will be required
to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**Stabilization**

In connection with the Offering, HSBC Bank plc (the ‘‘Stabilizing Manager’’), or persons acting on its
behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the
open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in
the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons
acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing
Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly,
no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.’’_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of
the Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions
permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution
has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling
concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased
in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on
or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time,
performed, and may currently and/or in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment and
corporate banking, commercial lending and banking, consulting and other commercial services in the
ordinary course of business for us and our affiliates, and may have from time to time in the past held, and
may in the future hold, positions in our or any of our affiliates’ securities or enter into hedging or general
derivative transactions with us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they received
or will receive customary fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and
for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and U.S. securities activities may involve our or
our affiliates’ securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise).
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and at any time
may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, certain
of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may routinely hedge their credit exposure to our or our
affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of
either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our or our affiliates’

271


-----

securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are arrangers and lenders under the Amended
and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement that we have entered into as borrowers and under the
Bridge Facility that we used to provide financing for a portion of the Saloni Acquisition and repay certain
outstanding indebtedness and have received and will receive customary fees in such capacities. The
proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay the Bridge Facility on the Issue Date and, together with cash
on hand, pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Offering. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

nature of the review procedures applied. Saloni’s current independent auditors are KPMG Auditores, S.L.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the Exchange
Act.

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this Offering
Memorandum and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related
amendment or supplement to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering
Memorandum acknowledges that: (1) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us
and to review, and has received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the
accuracy and completeness of the information herein; (2) such person has not relied on any of the Initial
Purchasers or any person affiliated with any Initial Purchaser in connection with its investigation of the
accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and (3) except as provided pursuant to (1) above,
no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation concerning the
Notes or the Guarantees offered hereby other than those contained herein and, if given or made, such
other information or representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or any
Initial Purchaser. We have agreed in the Indenture governing these Notes that, for so long as the Notes
remain outstanding and are ‘‘restricted securities’’ within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, upon written
request of a holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, furnish to such holder or beneficial owner or to the
Trustee or any relevant paying agent for delivery to such holder or beneficial owner or prospective
purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be, the information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to permit compliance with Rule 144A thereunder in
connection with resales of the Notes. Any such request should be directed to the Issuer at Worcester Road,
Kidderminster, Worcestershire DY10 1JR.

So long as the Notes are admitted to the Exchange, and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so
require, copies of such information will also be available for review during the normal business hours on
any business day at the specified office of the Issuer.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and many of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in England and Wales. Other
Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain and Australia, and future Guarantors may also be
organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. Most of our directors and executive officers and many
of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although we and
each of the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on our directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or
security providers. In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their
directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
against them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the
Federal securities laws of the United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of
U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which our
Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed
to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in
England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such
an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by
the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable
in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or
in respect of a penalty or fine;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and is not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

- the U.S. judgment is not a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another
court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of
such court; or

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period).

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an
English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in
England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

276


-----

**Spain**

Any final and conclusive judgment rendered outside Spain, in a country not bound by the provisions of EU
Regulation number 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (and, in particular, in the
United States), would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Spain pursuant to the following
regimes:

- In accordance with the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence
between Spain and the United States for these purposes);

- In the absence of any such treaty, the judgment would be enforced in Spain subject to Article 523 of
the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) if none of the
following grounds for refusal in compliance with the Spanish International Legal Cooperation in Civil
Matters Act (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio de cooperaci´on jur´ıdica internacional en materia civil, the
‘‘Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act’’) concur:

(i) the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (orden p´ublico);

(ii) the judgement is not final (i.e., subject to further appeal) and therefore is not an enforceable
nature (fuerza ejecutiva) in the foreign jurisdiction;

(iii) the judgment is rendered due to a clear breach of the rights to defense of either party (if a
judgement has been rendered by default (‘‘en rebeld´ıa’’) against the defendant it is deemed to
breach his rights of defense if he not been regularly and timely notified in a manner enabling him
to defend himself properly);

(vi) the judgment is on a matter over which the Spanish courts have exclusive jurisdiction, or with
respect to other matters if the foreign court’s jurisdiction does not have reasonable connection
with the dispute;

(v) the judgment is incompatible with another judgment rendered in Spain;

(vi) the judgment is incompatible with a previous judgment rendered in another country which
satisfies the conditions to be enforceable in Spain;

(vi) existence of an action pending in Spain between the same parties and on the same subject-matter,
commenced before the foreign proceeding; or

(vii) the Guarantors are subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain and the foreign judgment does
not meet the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act.

(viii)the copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish Court is not duly apostilled or the
documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement is not accompanied by a
Spanish translation in accordance with Article 144 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act
(Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil).

In addition, should the Guarantors be subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain the Provisions
contained in the Spanish Insolvency Act should be taken into account.

According to Article 3.2 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act, the Spanish
Government may establish that the Spanish authorities will not cooperate with another country’s
authorities where there has been a refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation
by such other country’s authorities.

Additionally, article 47 of the Spanish International Cooperation in Civil Matters Act provides for a special
provision and a special rule concerning the recognition of foreign judgments rendered in proceedings
resulting from collective action, which may be recognized and enforced in Spain insofar as they satisfy the
conditions set forth therein.

The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain, which would not
directly be recognized or enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability
of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera
_Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) for which the foregoing requirements must be_
met.

277


-----

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due
and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest
will be paid in euros.

A final and conclusive judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound
by the provisions of EU Regulation number 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters would be
recognized and enforceable by the Spanish courts, without review of its merits.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:
(a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish
(translator’s fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may be required to be legalized and apostilled;
(c) certain court fees must be paid, and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be
directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (e) the
content and validity of foreign law, if needed, must be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could, again,
entail certain costs). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the
parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

**Australia**

While the Australian _Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) makes provision for the enforcement of certain_
overseas judgments in Australia by registration, that Act does not apply to United States judgments. In
order to enforce a United States judgment in Australia:

- the judgment creditor must rely on common law principles in Australia by commencing fresh
proceedings in an Australian court to sue for the judgment amount as a debt; and

- each of the following conditions must be satisfied:

(i) the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive, in that it must end the proceeding and the
dispute to which the proceeding relates and the matter was not the subject of an earlier final and
conclusive judgment by another court having jurisdiction;

(ii) the parties to the U.S. judgment must be identical to the parties to the Australian enforcement
proceeding;

(iii) the U.S. judgment must be for a fixed, or readily calculable, sum and not in the nature of a tax,
fine or penalty;

(iv) the U.S. Court giving the judgment did not lack jurisdiction to give the judgment;

(v) the U.S. Court must have exercised jurisdiction which is recognized by Australia—this
requirement will usually be satisfied where the judgment debtor was ordinarily resident or
present in the U.S. at the time the proceeding was served, or otherwise voluntarily submitted to
the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court;

(vi) the U.S. judgment must not be wholly satisfied (and enforcement must only be sought to the
extent the judgment is not satisfied); and

(vii) the enforcement proceeding must have been commenced within any applicable limitation
periods.

Under common law principles in Australia, a defense will be available against the enforcement of a
U.S. judgment in Australia if:

- the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud or duress;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would contravene public policy; or

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would offend notions of natural justice or fairness.

The Australian Attorney-General may also make a declaration under the _Foreign Proceedings (Excess of_
_Jurisdiction) Act 1984 in respect of a U.S. judgment in relation to anti-trust proceedings, resulting in the_
judgment not being enforceable in Australia.

**ANNEX A: SUMMARY OF CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPANISH GAAP AND IFRS**

The Consolidated Group Financial Statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS. The Keraben Financial Statements and the Saloni Financial Statements included herein have been
prepared in accordance with Spanish GAAP.

Spanish GAAP differs from IFRS in certain material respects. The matters described below cannot
necessarily be expected to reveal all differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS that are relevant to us.
Consequently, there can be no assurance that these are the only differences in the accounting principles
that could have a significant impact on the financial information included herein. In making an investment
decision, you must rely upon your own examination of our business, the terms of the Offering and the
financial information herein. You should consult with your own professional advisors for an understanding
of the differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS, and how those differences might affect the financial
information set out herein. Certain key differences between Spanish GAAP and IFRS include, among
others, the following:

**Research costs**

- Under Spanish GAAP, research expenditure may be capitalized if it meets the same requirements as
those for the capitalization of development expenditure, and if it is amortized over its useful life (up to
a maximum of five years). Development costs are capitalized if the related requirements are met and
if they are amortized over their useful life (presumed up to the maximum of five years if there is no
evidence to the contrary).

- Under IFRS, capitalization is only permitted for development costs. Research costs are charged as an
expense when incurred.

**Plant, Property and Equipment**

- Under Spanish GAAP, elements of property, plant and equipment are recognized at the cost of
acquisition or production less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, except for
land, that is presented at cost less accumulated impairment.

- Under IFRS, an entity can choose either the cost model or the revaluation model as its accounting
policy and must apply that policy to the entire class of property, plant and equipment. Under the cost
model, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment, except for land, that is presented at cost less any accumulated impairment.
Under the revaluation model, property, plant and equipment are presented at their fair value based
on periodic valuations by independent evaluators, less subsequent depreciation. Any accumulated
depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset,
and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

**Investment Properties**

- Under Spanish GAAP, property (land and/or buildings) held for rental income and/or for capital
appreciation is accounted for on a historical-cost basis. The carrying amount of the buildings is
depreciated. Land and buildings are presented net of accumulated impairment.

- Under IFRS, investment property (land and/or buildings) held for rental income and/or for capital
appreciation, as well as development property (properties under construction or development for
future use as investment properties), may be accounted for: (i) on a historical-cost basis, less
accumulated depreciation (in the case of buildings) and any accumulated impairment; or (ii) on a fair
value basis with gains and losses arising from a change in the fair value recognized in the income
statement. If the fair value model is used, the carrying amount is not depreciated.

**Finance Lease—Initial Recognition**

- Under Spanish GAAP, finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the lower of
the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. For
discounting the present value of the minimum lease payments, the interest rate implicit in the lease is
used, or, if such interest rate is impracticable to determine, the interest rate of similar transactions of
the group/entity is used.

- Under IFRS, finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair
value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. For discounting
the present value of the minimum lease payments, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used, or, if
such interest rate is impracticable to determine, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used.

**Grants, donations and bequests received:**

- Under Spanish GAAP, grants, donations and bequests received from third parties other than the
owners are accounted under the following criteria: (i) non-repayable capital-based grants are
measured at the fair value of the amount or the asset granted, and they are added to income in
proportion to the depreciation in the period corresponding to the assets for which the grants were
received; (ii) repayable subsidies are entered as liabilities while they remain repayable; and
(iii) operating subsidies are entered in the results at the time at which they are awarded, unless they
are used to finance operational deficits in future years, in which case they are entered in the relevant
financial year. If they are awarded in order to finance specific costs, they are entered as the costs being
financed accrued. Subsidies, donations and bequests received from shareholders or owners do not
constitute income and are recorded directly in equity.

- Under IFRS, government grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are recognised only
when there is reasonable assurance that: (i) the entity complies with the conditions associated with
them and; (ii) the relevant grants are actually received. Government grants are recognised as income
over the period necessary to match them with related costs for which they are intended to compensate
on a systematic basis. Non-monetary grants, such as land or other resources, are usually accounted for
at fair value, although recording both the asset and the grant at a nominal amount is also permitted.
Even if there are no conditions attached to the grants specifically relating to the operating activities of
the entity, such grants should not be credited to equity. A grant receivable as compensation for costs
already incurred or for immediate financial support, with no future related costs, should be recognised
as income in the period in which it is receivable. A grant relating to assets may be presented in one of
two ways: (i) as deferred income or; (ii) by deducting the grant from the asset’s carrying amount. If a
grant becomes repayable, it should be treated as a change in estimate.

**Statement of Cash Flows**

- Spanish GAAP provides a presentation of the statement of cash flows in a standard format using the
indirect method, whereby profit and loss is adjusted for: (i) the effects of transactions of non-cash
nature; (ii) any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments; and
(iii) items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.

- IFRS permits the presentation of the statement of cash flows using one of the following two methods:
(i) the direct method, being the method recommended by the IASB; or (ii) the indirect method, being
the method most commonly used and most similar to Spanish GAAP.

**Statement of Cash Flows—Presentation of Cash Flows related to Interest and Taxes**

- Under Spanish GAAP, interest paid/received is presented under cash flow from operating activities in
the statement of cash flows. Additionally, cash flows arising from taxes on income are classified as
cash flows from operating activities. In both cases, Spanish GAAP does not provide alternative
presentation or classification.

- Under IFRS, interest paid and interest received are usually classified under cash flow from operating
activities in the statement of cash flows. However, alternatively, interest paid and interest received
may be classified as financing cash flows and investing cash flows, respectively. In addition, under
IFRS, when it is practicable to identify the tax cash flow with an individual transaction that gives rise
to cash flows that are classified as investing or financing activity, the tax cash flow is accordingly
classified as investing or financing activity.

**Business Combinations involving Entities under Common Control**

- Under Spanish GAAP, assets recognized in transfers of equity shares of other companies (so long as
they conform to the definition of a business) involving the parent of the group or the parent of a
subgroup and its directly or indirectly owned subsidiary, are recorded in the consolidated accounts of

283


-----

the ultimate Spanish parent company at book value, calculated in accordance with Spanish GAAP. If
consolidated accounts are not available, the separate standalone accounts of the parent are used.

- Under IFRS, notwithstanding the fact that business combinations involving entities under common
control are excluded from the scope of IFRS 3, an entity or a group must develop an accounting policy
to account for transactions involving entities under common control in accordance with IAS 8. Two
methods are widely observed in practice: (i) the application of IFRS 3 by analogy (i.e. purchase
accounting); and (ii) the predecessor method (i.e. carry-forwards of historical cost book values).

**1. General Information**

These condensed consolidated financial statements for the 13 weeks ended June 30, 2018 have not been
audited by the Auditor.

The information for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2018 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined
in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The Auditor’s report on those accounts was unqualified and did
not include a reference to any matter to which the Auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying the report and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act
2006.

**2. Basis of preparation and accounting policies**

These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group’s
financial statements for the 52 weeks ended March 31, 2018, which were prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.

With the exception of the adoption of IFRS 15 on April 1, 2018, these interim financial statements have
been prepared on a consistent basis and in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the group’s
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2018. There was no material impact
on the group’s results as a consequence of the transition to IFRS 15 as the group’s activities are primarily
the sale of flooring products, the revenue for which was previously recognised at a point in time when the
transfer of risks and rewards occurs which is consistent with IFRS 15. The comparative figures in these
interim financial statements have not been restated as a consequence of adopting IFRS 15 for the first time
this period.

Having reviewed the Group’s projections, and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, the Directors believe they have reasonable grounds for stating that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements
of the Group.

**3. Segmental information**

The Group is organised into two operating divisions, the sale of floorcovering products in the UK &
Europe and Australia.

Geographical segment information for revenue, operating profit and a reconciliation to entity net profit is
presented below.

management team were required to invest A8.3 million into a performance plan linked to the financial
results of the target business over a five year period. The value of this plan can go up or down from
the original A8.3 million subscription, depending on performance. Customary good and bad leaver
provisions apply during the five year period. This investment by management was rolled over from

(a) Non-cash annual cost of the redemption premium in relation to the BGF loan and option.

(b) Non-cash costs relating to the revaluation of deferred consideration and contingent earn-outs.
Deferred consideration is measured at amortised cost, while contingent consideration is measured
under IFRS 3 at fair value. Both are discounted for the time value of money. The present value is then
remeasured at each half-year and year-end in relation to the appropriateness of the discount factor
and the unwind of this discount. In addition, any changes to contingent earn-outs arising from actual
and forecast business performance are reflected as other adjustments to present value of contingent
earn-out liabilities.

(c) Non-cash fair value adjustment on foreign exchange forward contracts.

(d) Net impact of exchange rate movements on third party and intercompany loans.

**Acquisition of Ceramica Saloni**

On August 7, 2018 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Ceramica Saloni, SAU and Sanicova, S.L.U
(together ‘‘Saloni’’). Saloni operates from near Castellon and the Group’s Keraben business, in the heart
of the Spanish ceramics industry, manufacturing mid to high-end ceramic and porcelain tiles, which are
sold domestically and exported internationally. Its main markets are Spain and France, where it sells its
products predominantly to direct markets.

Cash consideration of A96.7m (£86.2m[1]) was paid on completion. This was satisfied in part through a
placing of 7,314,626 new Ordinary Shares at a price of 827 pence per Ordinary Share, raising gross
proceeds of approximately £60.5 million, and new bank facilities with Barclays and HSBC. There is no
deferred or contingent consideration.

**Independent auditor’s report**
**to the members of Victoria PLC**

**Opinion**

**Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified**

We have audited the financial statements of Victoria PLC (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘group’) for the period ended March 31, 2018 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Statements
of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial
statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion:

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent
company’s affairs as at March 31, 2018 and of the group’s profit for the period then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union;

- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies
Act 2006; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the
group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities,
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Who we are reporting to**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us
to report to you where:

- the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is not appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.

**Overview of our audit approach**

- Overall materiality: £1,600,000, which represents 4% of the group’s profit before tax after exceptional
items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and other non-underlying finance costs have been
excluded;

- Key audit matters were identified as valuation of goodwill and intangibles, valuation of contingent and
deferred consideration, impairment of goodwill, and valuation of defined benefit pension scheme for
the group;

- We performed full scope audit procedures on significant components in the United Kingdom, Spain,
the Netherlands, Italy and Australia. We performed analytical procedures over non-significant
components in the Netherlands and Belgium, and the United Kingdom; and

- We issued group instructions to component auditors in respect of their full scope audit of the
significant components

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

**Key observations**

Based on our audit work, we found the valuation
methodologies and the actuarial assumptions
applied by management to be reasonable and
consistent with the expectation of our actuarial
specialists. We consider that the group’s disclosures
in note 20 appropriately describe the significant
degree of inherent imprecision in the assumptions
and estimates and the potential impact on future
periods of revisions to these estimates. We found no
errors in the underlying calculations.

We did not identify any Key Audit Matters relating to the audit of the financial statements of the parent
company.

**Our application of materiality**

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We
use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results
of that work.

**An overview of the scope of our audit**


19OCT201810352012


Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group’s
business, its environment and risk profile. The components of the group were identified by the group audit
team based on a measure of materiality, considering each as a percentage of the group’s total assets,

F-21


-----

revenues and profit before taxation, to assess the significance of the component and determine the planned
audit response.

A full scope audit approach for all significant components was determined based on their relative
materiality to the group and our assessment of the audit risk. For significant components requiring a full
scope approach we evaluated the processes and controls over the financial reporting system identified as
part of our risk assessment, reviewed the financial statement production process and addressed critical
accounting matters such as those related to the key audit matters as identified above. We then undertook
substantive testing on significant transactions and material account balances.

In order to respond to the audit risks identified in our risk assessment, we performed a full scope audit of
the financial statements of the parent company, Victoria PLC (in the United Kingdom), and of other
significant component entities in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Australia. The
significant components represented 91.7 percent of consolidated revenues and 92.4 percent of underlying
profit before taxation. Statutory audits of subsidiaries, where required by local legislation, were performed
to a lower materiality where applicable.

The non-significant group components were subject to analytical procedures with a focus on the key audit
matters as identified above and the significance to the group’s balances.

Detailed audit instructions were issued to the auditors of all the significant components. The instructions
highlighted the significant risks to be addressed through their procedures and detailed the information to
be reported to the group audit team. The group audit team conducted a remote review of the work
performed by the component auditors, and communicated with all component auditors throughout the
planning, fieldwork and concluding stages of the local audits.

**Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 23, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006**

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or
the directors’ report.

F-22


-----

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit

**Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 23, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or
the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the

under IFRS 3 at fair value. Both are discounted for the time value of money. The present value is then
remeasured at each half-year and year-end in relation to the appropriateness of the discount factor
and the unwind of this discount. In addition, any changes to contingent earn-outs arising from actual
and forecast business performance are reflected as other adjustments to present value of contingent
earn-out liabilities.

(d) Fair value adjustments on corporate bonds held.

(e) Non-cash fair value adjustment on foreign exchange forward contracts.

**Share based payment schemes**

On April 29, 2016, the Group Finance Director, Michael Scott, was awarded 5,000 B ordinary shares (the
‘‘B Shares’’) in a new intermediate holding company, Victoria Midco Holdings Limited, in connection with
a share-based incentive plan as recommended by the Remuneration Committee. Between the second and
third anniversary of his joining the Company, Mr Scott is able to exchange the B Shares into ordinary
shares in Victoria PLC (‘‘Ordinary Shares’’) of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award
represents approximately 0.611% of the growth in value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of
£3.00. Since the year end, Mr Scott has exercised his option, exchanging the B Shares for 395,476 Ordinary
Shares.

On June 8, 2017, Mr Scott was awarded 5,350 C ordinary shares and certain other employees 1,070 C
ordinary shares (collectively the ‘‘C Shares’’) in connection with the share-based incentive plan. Between
the July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 participants will be able to exchange the C Shares into Ordinary Shares
of equivalent value. The monetary value of the award represents approximately 0.733% of the growth in
value of the Ordinary Shares above a share price of £6.75. The Plan is subject to good leaver and bad
leaver provisions.

The B and C Shares have been valued for the purposes of IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) using a Black
Scholes model. The key inputs and assumptions applied in this model for the B and C Shares are set out in
the table below:

**Inputs and Assumptions** **B Shares** **C Shares**

Based on this model, the aggregate fair value of the B Shares was assessed to be £263,150 and for the
C Shares £322,733. The fair value of the respective B and C Shares are charged to the income statement
over the expected terms.

The expected volatility assumption has been determined based on historical share price volatility over a
period commensurate with the expected maximum term of the respective B and C Shares issued.

**6. Taxation (Continued)**

Corporation tax is calculated at the applicable percentage of the estimated assessable profit for the year in
each respective geography. This is 19% in the UK; 25% in the Netherlands and Spain; 27.9% in Italy; 30%
in Australia; and 29% in Belgium.

The charge in respect of non-qualifying sampling assets incurred in the prior year of £682,000 is a
non-recurring timing difference resulting from the change in accounting policy in the year ended April 2,
2016.

The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

Goodwill is attributed to the businesses identified below for the purpose of testing impairment. These
businesses are the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and represent cash generating units
(‘‘CGUs’’). The CGUs within a reported segment share similar characteristics to each other and to the
other businesses within that segment.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill
might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The
key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. The discount rates used of 10.4% for
CGUs within the UK; 9.1% for CGUs within Holland; 10.4% for CGUs within Spain; 12.7% for CGUs
within Italy; and 11% for CGUs within Australia are estimated using weighted-average costs of capital that
reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the markets in
which the businesses operate. The primary reasons for the difference in the rates between the UK, Europe
and Australia are the differences in underlying risk-free rates and cost of debt. The calculation uses cash
flow projections extrapolated for five years from the budget for the year ending March 30, 2019. Mid-term
growth rates in EBITDA are estimated at 4% for CGUs within the UK; 4% for CGUs within Australia;
and 7% for CGUs within Continental Europe. At the end of the discrete forecast period, a terminal value
is calculated based on a terminal growth rate assumption of 2.0%.

The Group does not consider it probable that any reasonable changes to the key assumptions would result
in impairment to any of the Goodwill balances. As at March 31, 2018 no impairment provision was
therefore considered necessary.

Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing
workforce.

None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

(a) Investment property held in the opening balance sheet relates to the legacy ownership of a small area of land in Kidderminster,
which is held at cost. The fair value of this land is dependent on future use and therefore cannot be accurately estimated.

The increase in investment property during the year relates to properties obtained as part of the acquisition of Keraben. These
are held at cost, according to the opening balance sheet of Keraben, which is equal to their total fair value at the date of
acquisition. The fair value at March 31, 2018 is deemed to be materially unchanged.

circumstances of the individual customer. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of all
receivables, including those impaired, approximates to their fair value.

fair value hierarchy as Level 3. The deferred and contingent earn-out liabilities falling due after one year of
£25.25m is split as follows: between one to two years is £11.20m and between two to five years is £14.05m.

Deferred income relates to government grants as shown in Note 24.

Employee incentive plan liability relates to an incentive plan put in place for the senior management of
Keraben Grupo S.A.U. which involved an initial investment by participants. The fair value of the scheme is
linked to the performance of Keraben over a five year period, and the difference between the expected
future fair value and the initial investment is being spread over this term. See accounting policies for
further details.

Bank loans as at March 31, 2018 relate to a Group multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Term
Loan, each provided by a number of banks. Both facilities mature on October 15, 2020, and are secured by
way of debenture over the assets of the Group.

The Subordinated loans relate to the debt component of the BGF loan and option instruments. During the
year there was a significant modification to the terms of the loan, on which the coupon was reduced from
10% to 6% in September 2017. A corresponding extinguishment charge of £705,000 and release of prepaid
costs of £210,000 have been charged to finance costs within the income statement (see Note 3).

The Group’s net debt position as at March 31, 2018 was £258.7m (2017: £89.6m), before netting off
prepaid finance costs. The contractual maturities of financial liabilities and average effective interest rates
are set out in Note 25.

**Fair value measurement of financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into three
levels of fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to
the measurement as follows:

- Level one: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level two: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level one that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly

- Level three: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities

All financial assets and liabilities have been identified as Level one with the exception of:

- Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are Level two financial assets/liabilities and all expire
within 12 months from March 31, 2018.

- The Group’s interest rate swap contract, which is a Level two financial asset and expired in May 2018.

The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for complex
valuations of the forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contract. Valuation techniques have
utilised observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract.
The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts and the interest
rate swap contract.

- Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities.

The fair value of the contingent earn-out liabilities arising from acquisitions is determined considering the
value of estimated future payments, discounted to present value. Payments are determined by mechanisms
set out in each acquisition agreement, and are generally based on EBITDA performance over a three to
four year period. Estimated future payments are calculated using financial projections based on
operational budgets for the next 12 months and then applying growth assumptions for future years as
appropriate. Discount rates are reviewed annually for each acquisition, and range between 11.5% and
18.5%.

The most significant inputs, all of which are unobservable, are the estimated growth rates in future profits
and the discount rates applied. The estimated fair value increases if the estimated growth rates increase or
the discount rates decrease. The overall valuations are sensitive to both assumptions. The Board considers
that changing the above unobservable inputs to reflect other reasonably possible alternative assumptions
would not result in a significant change in the estimated fair value.

There were no transfers between Level one, Level two and Level three in 2018 or 2017.

(2017: 30%), 25% in respect of balances relating to the Dutch businesses (2017: 25%), 25% in respect of
balances relating to the Spanish business (2017: n/a), 29% in respect of balances relating to the Belgian
business (2017: n/a), and 27.9% in respect of balances relating to the Italian business (2017: n/a). The rates
applied to UK balances vary dependent on the timing of when the balances are expected to unwind as
noted below.

**Effect on UK deferred tax balances of proposed changes in the UK corporation tax rate**

The UK corporation tax rate reductions, from 20% to 19% on April 1, 2017, and to 17% on April 1, 2020,
have been substantively enacted. Accordingly, deferred tax balances at March 31, 2018 have been
calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.

**20. Retirement benefit obligations**

**Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The companies and the
employees contribute towards the schemes.

Contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and amounted to £3,712,000
(2017: £3,265,000), of which £2,126,000 (2017: £2,111,000) relates to the UK schemes. The total
contributions outstanding at year-end were £nil (2017: £nil).

**Defined benefit schemes**

The Group has two defined benefit schemes, both of which relate to Interfloor Limited.

Interfloor Limited sponsors the Final Salary Scheme (‘‘the Main Scheme’’) and the Interfloor Limited
Executive Scheme (‘‘the Executive Scheme’’) which are both defined benefit arrangements. The defined
benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees
of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in
the scheme. The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the
assets of the fund.

The last full actuarial valuations of these schemes were carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at
July 31, 2015.

The contributions made by the employer over the financial period were £95,000 (2017: £95,000) in respect
of the Main Scheme and £126,000 (2017: £126,000) in respect of the Executive Scheme.

Contributions to the Executive and Main Schemes are made in accordance with the Schedule of
Contributions. Future contributions are expected to be an annual premium of £95,000 in respect of the
Main Scheme and £126,000 contributions payable to the Executive Scheme. These payments are in line
with the certified Schedules of Contributions until they are reviewed on completion of the triennial
valuations of the schemes as at August 1, 2018.

As both schemes are closed to future accrual there will be no current service cost in future years.

The defined benefit schemes typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk,
interest rate risk and longevity risk.

**Investment risk**

The present value of the defined benefit schemes’ liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the returns on schemes’ assets are below this rate, it will
create a scheme deficit. Due to the long-term nature of the schemes’ liabilities, the trustees of the pension
fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the schemes’ assets should be invested in equity
securities to leverage the return generated by the funds.

**Notes to the accounts (Continued)**

**20. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

**Interest risk**

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the schemes’ liability but this will be partially offset by an
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.

**Longevity risk**

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of
the schemes’ participants will increase the schemes’ liability.

The present value of the defined benefit liabilities was measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected rates of return on plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall
expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated
balance in the plan’s investment portfolio.

Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the consolidated balance sheet date
were as follows:

**2018** **2017**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.5% 2.5%**

Pension in payment increases of CPI or 3% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.1% 2.1%**

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position date are based on 115% of the standard actuarial mortality tables and include an
allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65 year-old
to live for a number of years as follows:

(i) Current pensioner aged 65: 20.9 years (male), 22.8 years (female).

(ii) Future retiree (aged 45) upon reaching 65: 22.0 years (male), 24.1 years (female).

**20. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate,
expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on
reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period,
while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate decreased by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 4.5%.

If the rate of inflation increases by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by
3.3%.

If the life expectancy increases by one year for both men and women, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by 4.5%.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as
some of the assumptions may be correlated.

In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as
that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Group expects to make a contribution of £221,000 (2017: £221,000) to the defined benefit schemes
during the next financial period.

The Company has one class of Ordinary shares which carries no right to fixed income.

**Capital risk management**

The Group considers its capital to comprise its Ordinary share capital, share premium, accumulated
retained earnings and net debt. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its
continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital
growth and distributions.

In order to achieve this objective, the Group monitors its gearing to balance risks and returns at an
acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working
capital and strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these
aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group
considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

The Group is subjected to a number of financial covenants in connection with its Group bank facilities.
These covenants are tested quarterly and were not breached during the year.

**22. Reserves**

**(a) Retained earnings**

Retained earnings for the Group as at March 31, 2018 were £26,659,000 (2017: £16,451,000).

The loss of the Company for the year determined in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 was
£5,430,000 (2017: profit of £2,733,000). The Company is exempt under Section 408 of the Companies Act
2006 from presenting its own Income statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income.

group and granted BGF an option for 3,730,000* new Victoria PLC ordinary 5p shares at an exercise price
of £0.572* (together, the ‘‘BGF loan and option’’). The BGF loan and option is accounted for as separate
debt and equity components. The equity component was determined to have a fair value of £682,000.
Following the exercise of the BGF share option, in November 2017, this amount was transferred to Share
Premium.

The above decrease in the current year was partially offset by an increase of £222,000 relating to a sharebased payment charge (see further details in Note 5).

**23. Acquisition of subsidiaries**

**(a) Keraben Grupo**

On November 16, 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Keraben Grupo S.A.

Keraben is a large ceramic tiles business, based in Castellon, Spain. It designs, manufactures and
distributes a range of white body and porcelain tiles for both wall and floor covering. Its products are
priced at the medium to high-end of the market and are sold throughout western Europe under three
different brands, each with a strong market reputation.

The acquisition is expected to be significantly earnings-accretive, with additional commercial synergy
opportunities to drive incremental profits. The enlarged group is substantially diversified in terms of both
product and geography, and Keraben is considered an ideal platform for further potential acquisitions
within this market segment.

The Group results for the year ended March 31, 2018 include contribution from Keraben of A46.8m
(£41.1m[1]) of revenue and A10.8m (£9.5m[1]) of profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles
and acquisition costs). If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year Group
revenue and profit before tax would have been higher by A82.9m (£72.9m[1]) and A21.0m (£18.5m[1])
respectively.

**Consideration**

Cash consideration of A274.1m (£243.4m[2]) was paid on completion of the acquisition. There is no deferred
or contingent consideration.

Other than where fair value adjustments have been made, the book value of assets acquired is considered
to approximate their fair values. Gross trade receivables acquired are considered to equate to the fair value
of contractually collectable cash flows.

The other taxes and social security figure in the acquired balance sheet of £21.5m is a one-off transactionrelated tax liability which crystallised on acquisition and was settled following completion. As such, whilst it
does not form part of the cost of investment in the Group balance sheet, it has been treated as an
investment-related item in the Group cash flow statement and included as part of investments in
subsidiaries net of cash acquired.

As a condition of the acquisition, the senior management team of Keraben Grupo S.A.U were required to
invest £7.2m in a new incentive structure under Victoria ownership (see Note 15). This cash inflow has
been treated as investment related and deducted from the investment in subsidiaries net of cash acquired.

After fair value adjustments, goodwill of £115.8m is created on the consolidation of Keraben, which relates
to expected future profits of the business.

Transaction costs amounting to £836,000 relating to the acquisition have been recognised as an expense
and included in exceptional administrative expenses in the Group income statement.

**(b) Ceramiche Serra**

On December 1, 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Ceramiche Serra S.p.A.

Serra, operating from sites in Serramazzoni, Sassuolo (near Bologna), the heart of the Italian ceramics
industry, manufactures ceramic flooring, which is sold domestically and exported internationally. It sells to

a combination of wholesalers, retail groups, and independent stores throughout Continental Europe,
North America, and the Far East.

The Group results for the year ended March 31, 2018 include contribution from Serra of A6.5m (£5.7m[1]) of
revenue and A2.5m (£2.2m[1]) of profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles and
acquisition costs). If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year Group
revenue and profit before tax would have been higher by A12.8m (£11.3m[1]) and A5.6m (£4.9m[1])
respectively.

**Consideration**

The consideration for the acquisition comprises:

(i) Initial cash consideration of A38.1m (£33.6m[2]);

(ii) Contingent cash consideration of up to A20.0m (£17.6m[2]) dependent on improved EBITDA and other
criteria over the next four years.

outcomes of contingent consideration is considered to be immaterial.

After fair value adjustments, goodwill of £14.9m is created on the consolidation of Serra, which relates to
expected future profits of the business.

Transaction costs amounting to £1,657,000 relating to the acquisition have been recognised as an expense
and included in the administrative expenses in the Group income statement.

**(c) Millennium Weavers Europe**

On June 1, 2017 the Group acquired the business and assets of Millennium Weavers Europe, a carpet
distribution business based in Belgium. The acquisition further enhances the Group’s coverage of the
UK volume market.

Cash consideration of A3,494,000 (£3,069,000) was paid, with transaction costs of £170,000 recognised
within administrative expenses. The fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities was equal to the price
paid. No goodwill is recognised on acquisition and no separately identified intangible assets were acquired.

**25. Financial instruments**

**Background**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks
and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout the financial statements.

There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from
previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.

The ‘‘financial instruments’’ which are affected by these risks comprise borrowings, cash and liquid
resources used to provide finance for the Group’s operations, together with various items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, inter-company payables and receivables,
and any derivatives transactions (such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) used
to manage the risks from interest rate and currency rate volatility.

**Notes to the accounts (Continued)**

**25. Financial instruments (Continued)**

**General objectives, policies and processes**

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports through which it reviews the effectiveness of
the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set
out below:

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and
investments.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed
locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are
obtained from reputable external sources. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss
event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction on the recoverability of the cash
flows.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties
are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of
counterparties and customers.

The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the
performances of which are closely monitored. The Directors confirm that the carrying amounts of monies
owed by its subsidiaries approximate to their fair value.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and
principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have
sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.

To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed
facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days.

The Board monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts against actual cash position on a monthly
basis. At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient
liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

The maturity of financial liabilities is detailed in Note 16.

**Market risk**

Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is
the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
interest rates (interest rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk), or market pricing (price risk).

**a) Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, equity capital and bank facilities,
including hire purchase and lease finance. The Group borrows in the desired currency at floating or fixed
rates of interest and may then use interest rate swaps to secure the desired interest profile and manage
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

**Notes to the accounts (Continued)**

**25. Financial instruments (Continued)**

**Interest rate sensitivity**

The annualised effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the
variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase
in post-tax profit for the year of £1,209,000 (2017: increase in post-tax profit of £423,000). A 50 basis point
increase in the interest rate would, on the same basis, have reduced the profit for the year by the same
amount.

**Borrowings contractual maturities and effective interest rate analysis**

In respect of interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates the undiscounted amounts
due for the remaining contractual maturity (including interest payments based on the outstanding liability
at the year end) and their effective interest rates. The ageing of these amounts is based on the earliest

**Notes to the accounts (Continued)**

**25. Financial instruments (Continued)**

**Non-interest bearing liabilities**

Details of trade and other payables falling due within one year are set out in Note 15.

**b) Currency risk**

The main currency exposure of the Group arises from the ownership of the continental European and
Australian subsidiaries, which account for approximately 62.8% and 9.8% of the Group’s total assets,
respectively.

It is the Board’s policy not to hedge against movements in the Sterling/Australian Dollar and Sterling/Euro
exchange rate.

Other currency exposure derives from trading operations where goods are exported or raw materials and
capital equipment are imported. These exposures may be managed by forward currency contracts,
particularly when the amounts or periods to maturities are significant and at times when currencies are
particularly volatile.

**Currency risk sensitivity**

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australian Dollar against Sterling over the full year would, all
other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in Group post-tax profit for the year of £705,000
(2017: increased Group post-tax profit by £176,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the
same basis, have decreased Group post-tax profit by £577,000 (2017: decreased Group post-tax profit by
£144,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australia Dollar against Sterling at year-end rates would have
resulted in an increase to equity of £2,235,000 (2017: an increase of £2,103,000). A 10% weakening in the
exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased equity by £1,828,000 (2017: decrease of
£1,721,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Euro against Sterling over the full year would, all other variables
held constant, have resulted in a decrease in Group post-tax profit for the year of £309,000 (2017: decrease
of £68,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have increased Group
post-tax profit by £253,000 (2017: increase of £48,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Euro against Sterling at year-end rates would have resulted in a
decrease to equity of £280,000 (2017: decrease of £69,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would,
on the same basis, have increased equity by £229,000 (2017: increase of £56,000).

The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary
liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

**Liabilities** **Assets**
**2018** **2017** **2018** **2017**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

Australian Dollar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **24.9** 33.7 **77.8** 52.3

**c) Price**

The group is exposed to price risk in respect of corporate bonds held, which are accounted for within cash
and cash equivalents. The volatility of such securities is very low. If the quoted price for these securities
increased or decreased by 10%, profit before tax for the period and equity would have changed by
£540,000.

**d) Trading**

It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken other than in the corporate bonds held within cash and cash equivalents.

**26. Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised. Information about significant areas of estimation and critical
judgements that have the most significant impact on the financial statements are described in the following
notes:

**Measurement of intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognised on acquisitions in relation to customer relationships, brands and
developed technology.

The fair value of these assets are determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by
the asset where no active market for the assets exists. These are assessed based upon management
forecasts for each business in question. Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates,
expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty rates and customer attrition.

**Measurement of deferred tax assets**

The Group has potential deferred tax assets, principally in the form of tax losses but deferred tax assets are
only recognised to the extent it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against
which the losses and deductions can be utilised. Recognition therefore involves assessment of the future
performance of the particular legal entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Deferred tax
assets in respect of losses recognised at the balance sheet date are based on the assumption that there is a
high expectation that the asset will be realised in due course.

**Valuation of deferred and contingent earn-out consideration**

Liabilities are recognised in respect of acquisitions with outstanding deferred or contingent earn-outs at
the end of the period. These are assessed for each relevant business based upon management financial
projections for the next 12 months and applying growth assumptions for future years where relevant. Key
assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and
direct costs. Further details are set out in Note 17.

**Share based payments**

The Group has share based payment incentive arrangements in place for certain employees. The fair value
of the growth shares is based on growth in the share price of Victoria PLC above a hurdle and is measured
using appropriate valuation model (Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo) at grant date. Key assumptions include
expected volatility and the expected exercise period. The growth shares awarded effectively track the
market capitalisation of the Company, therefore historical share price volatility has been used as a guide to
the expected future volatility of the growth shares. As the fair value of the share based payment charge is
spread on a straight line basis to the income statement over the expected term this estimate impacts the
annual charge recognised.

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes. The obligations under the schemes are recognised in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by
independent actuaries, with input from the Directors. These actuarial valuations include assumptions such
as discount rates, return on assets and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from time to time according
to prevailing economic conditions.

Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising under
the scheme in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of the actuarial

assumptions. The effects of any change to these assumptions are accounted for in the next financial year as
other comprehensive income. The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefits is clearly
dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement. Further details are set out in
Note 20.

**Judgements**

**Impairment of goodwill, investments or intercompany balances**

Determining whether goodwill, investments or intercompany balances are impaired requires an estimation
of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which value has been allocated. The value in use
calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating
unit and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. On an annual basis the Group
is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill, investments
or intercompany balances are less than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a
calculation of expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. Details of
assumptions used in this review are detailed in Note 9.

**Senior management long-term incentive plan**

A new long-term management incentive plan was implemented post year end involving the issue of up to
100,000 ordinary shares in Victoria Midco Holdings Limited (the ‘‘Incentive Shares’’), a subsidiary of the
Company. Participants in the Plan will subscribe for these shares. The Plan will operate for a five year
period, with the value of the Incentive Shares linked to cumulative Total Shareholder Return delivered
each year above a hurdle, being the current market capitalisation of the Company increased annually by
20% p.a. on a compounding basis. At the end of the Plan, the Incentive Shares can be exchanged for new
ordinary shares in Victoria, at the then prevailing share price averaged over the month prior to exchange.
While the Company has the ability to buy back Incentive Shares after 3 years participants can only choose
to exchange at the end of the full five-year period of the Plan. Customary good and bad leaver provisions
will apply. The financial impact of the scheme has yet to be determined.

Corporation tax is calculated at 20%, 25% and 30% of the estimated assessable profit for the year in the
UK, the Netherlands and Australia respectively.

The charge in respect of non-qualifying sampling assets incurred in the year of £682,000 is a non-recurring
timing difference resulting from the change in accounting policy in the prior year relating to sampling
assets.

The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

The number of shares in issue increased by a factor of five on September 12, 2016 following approval of a
five-for-one share split at the AGM on September 9, 2016. The weighted average number of shares in issue
over the period has been determined on this new basis and the prior year has been restated accordingly.

The potential dilutive effect of the share options has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 using the
average share price in the period.

Goodwill is attributed to the businesses identified below for the purpose of testing impairment. These
businesses are the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and represent cash generating units
(‘‘CGUs’’). The CGUs within a reported segment share similar characteristics to each other and to the
other businesses within that segment.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill
might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The
key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. The discount rates used of 11.4% for
CGUs within the UK, 10.7% for CGUs within Europe and 12.3% for CGUs within Australia are estimated
using weighted-average costs of capital that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the markets in which the businesses operate. The primary reasons for the
difference in the rates between the UK, Europe and Australia are the differences in underlying risk-free
rates and cost of debt. The calculation uses cash flow projections extrapolated from the budget for the year
ending March 31, 2018. A terminal value was calculated based on a terminal growth rate assumption of
2.0%.

The Group does not consider it reasonably probable that any significant changes to the key assumptions
will arise that would result in impairment to any of the Goodwill balances. If the terminal growth rate was
assumed to be nil in the Directors’ opinion there would still be no provision for impairment required. As at
April 1, 2017 no impairment provision was therefore considered necessary.

Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing
workforce.

None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

**Fair value measurement of financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet are grouped into
three levels of fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant
inputs to the measurement as follows:

- Level one: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level two: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level one that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indrectly

- Level three: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities

All financial assets and liabilities have been identified as Level one with the exception of:

- Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are Level two financial assets/liabilities and all expire
within 12 months from April 1, 2017.

- The Group’s interest rate swap contract, which is a Level two financial asset and expires in May 2018.

The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for compex
valuations of the forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contract. Valuation techniques
have utilised observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of
the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts
and the interest rate swap contract.

- Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities.

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising from acquisitions is determined considering the
estimated payment discounted to present value. Estimated payments are calculated using financial
projections for the next 12 months and then applying growth assumptions for future years where
relevant.

The most significant inputs, all of which are unobservable, are the estimated growth rates in future profits
and the discount rates applied. The estimated fair value increases if the estimated growth rates increase or
the discount rates decrease. The overall valuations are sensititve to both assumptions. The Board considers

**17. Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

that changing the above unobservable inputs to reflect other reasonably possible alternative assumptions
would not result in a significant change in the estimated fair value.

There were no transfers between level one, level two and level three in 2017 or 2016.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**19. Deferred taxation (Continued)**

The provision is based on taxation rates of 30% in respect of balances relating to the Australia businesses
(2015: 30%) and 25% in respect of balances relating to the Dutch businesses. The rates applied to UK
balances vary dependent on the timing of when the balances are expected to unwind as noted below.

**Effect on UK deferred tax balances of proposed changes in the UK corporation tax rate**

The UK corporation tax rate reduction from 20% to 19% on April 1, 2017, to 18% on April 1, 2020 and to
17% on April 1, 2020 has been substantively enacted. Accordingly, deferred tax balances at April 1, 2017
have been calculated at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled.

**20. Retirement benefit obligations**

**Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The companies and the
employees contribute towards the schemes.

Contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and amounted to £3,265,000
(2016: £2,542,000), of which £2,111,000 (2016: £1,742,000) relates to the UK schemes. The total
contributions outstanding at year-end were £nil (2016: £nil).

**Defined benefit schemes**

The Group has two defined benefit schemes, both of which relate to Interfloor Limited.

Interfloor Limited sponsors the Final Salary Scheme (‘‘the Main Scheme’’) and the Interfloor Limited
Executive Scheme (‘‘the Executive Scheme’’) which are both defined benefit arrangements. The defined
benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees
of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in
the scheme. The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the
assets of the fund.

The last full actuarial valuations of these schemes were carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at
July 31, 2015.

The contributions made by the employer over the financial period were £95,000 (2016: £nil) in respect of
the Main Scheme and £126,000 (2016: £nil) in respect of the Executive Scheme.

Contributions to the Executive and Main Schemes are made in accordance with the Schedule of
Contributions. Future contributions are expected to be an annual premium of £95,000 in respect of the
Main Scheme and £126,000 contributions payable to the Executive Scheme. These payments are in line
with the certified Schedules of Contributions until they are reviewed on completion of the triennial
valuations of the schemes as at August 1, 2018.

As both schemes are closed to future accrual there will be no current service cost in future years.

The defined benefit schemes typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk,
interest rate risk and longevity risk.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**20. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

**Investment risk**

The present value of the defined benefit schemes’ liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the returns on schemes’ assets are below this rate, it will
create a scheme deficit. Due to the long-term nature of the schemes’ liabilities, the trustees of the pension
fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the schemes’ assets should be invested in equity
securities to leverage the return generated by the funds.

**Interest risk**

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the schemes’ liability but this will be partially offset by an
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.

**Longevity risk**

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of
the schemes’ participants will increase the schemes’ liability.

The present value of the defined benefit liabilities was measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected rates of return on plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall
expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated
balance in the plan’s investment portfolio.

Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the consolidated balance sheet date
were as follows:

**2017** **2016**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.5% 3.6%**
Revaluation rate of deferred pensioners of CPI or 5% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.4% 2.0%**
Pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **3.2% 2.9%**
Pension in payment increases of CPI or 3% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **2.1% 1.8%**

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position date are based on 115% of the standard actuarial mortality tables and include an
allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year-old
to live for a number of years as follows:

(i) Current pensioner aged 65: 20.9 years (male), 22.9 years (female).

(ii) Future retiree (aged 45) upon reaching 65: 22.2 years (male), 24.4 years (female).

Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows:


**2017** **2016**
**£000** **£000**


Administrative expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **—** 166

benefit liability is included in the statement of comprehensive income.

scheme liabilities, which reduced from 3.6% in 2016 to 2.5% in 2017. The discount rate is assessed by
reference to expected returns on high quality corporate bonds, which reduced significantly during the
period.

None of the fair values of the assets shown above include any of the employer’s own financial instruments
or any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the employer. All of the schemes assets have a quoted
market price in an active market.

The actual return on plan assets was £3,795,000 (2016: £435,000).

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate,
expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on
reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period,
while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate decreased by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 4.5%.

If the rate of inflation increases by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by
3.3%.

If the life expectancy increases by one year for both men and women, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by 4.1%.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as
some of the assumptions may be correlated.

In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as
that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Group expects to make a contribution of £221,000 (2016: £221,000) to the defined benefit schemes
during the next financial period.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**21. Share capital (Continued)**

**Capital risk management**

The Group considers its capital to comprise its Ordinary share capital, share premium, accumulated
retained earnings and net debt. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its
continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital
growth and distributions.

In order to achieve this objective, the Group monitors its gearing to balance risks and returns at an
acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working
capital and strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these
aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group
considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

The Group is subjected to a number of financial covenants in connection with its group bank facilities.
These covenants are tested quarterly and were not breached during the year.

**22. Reserves**

**(a) Retained earnings**

Retained earnings for the Group as at April 1, 2017 were £16,451,000 (2016: £10,257,000).

The profit of the Company for the year determined in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 was
£2,733,000 (2016: profit of £2,679,000). The Company is exempt under Section 408 of the Companies Act
2006 from presenting its own Income statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income.

**(b) Foreign exchange reserve**

The foreign exchange reserve for the Group as at April 1, 2017 was £5,027,000 (2016: £3,083,000), in
respect of foreign exchange differences on consolidation of overseas subsidiaries.

**(c) Share premium**

The share premium account for the Group as at April 1, 2017 was £52,472,000 (2016: £52,462,000), in
respect of premium received on the issuance of equity above the nominal value of the shares issued.

**(d) Other reserves**

The Company entered into a fully subordinated £10m 2022 unsecured loan note facility prodivded by the
Business Growth Fund (‘‘BGF’’) at the time of the acquisition of Abingdon Flooring group and granted
BGF an option for 3,730,000* new Victoria PLC ordinary 5p shares at an exercise price of £0.572*
(together, the ‘‘BGF loan and option’’). The BGF loan and option is accounted for as separete debt and
equity components. The equity component was determined to have a fair value of £682,000.

The increase of £112,000 in the current year relates to a share-based payment charge on growth shares
issued in the period (see further details in the Directors’ Report).

**23. Acquisition of subsidiaries**

**(a) Ezi Floor**

On October 3, 2016 the Group acquired the business and assets of Ezi Floor Limited.

Ezi Floor benefits from a modern, well equipped, manufacturing facility near Bradford, Yorkshire, and is
an efficient manufacturer and distributor of a range of underlay and underlay accessories for both the
residential and contract markets. It sells to wholesalers, retail groups, and independent stores throughout
the UK.

- Figures restated for the effect of the five for one share split effective from September 12, 2016.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**23. Acquisition of subsidiaries (Continued)**

The acquisition of Ezi Floor is highly complementary to the Group’s existing businesses, with the addition
of underlay and hard flooring ranges to the Group’s product portfolio which previously consisted of only
broadloom carpet and carpet tiles. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to the
underlying earnings per share of the Company.

The Group results for the year ended April 1, 2017 includes contribution from Ezi Floor of £4.4m of
revenue and £1.2m of underlying profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition
and reorganisation costs). If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year
Group revenue and underlying profit before tax would have been higher by £5.0m and £1.1m respectively.

**Consideration**

The consideration for the acquisition comprises:

(i) Initial cash consideration of £6.5m;

(ii) Deferred cash consideration of £6.5m, payable in annual instalments over four years; and

(iii) Contingent cash consideration of a maximum of £6.5m, wholly dependent on improved EBITDA over
the next four years.

Other than where fair value adjustments have been made, the book value of assets acquired is considered
to approximate their fair values. Gross trade receivables acquired are considered to equate to the fair value
of contractually collectable cash flows.

Depending on the future performance of Ezi Floor, the contingent element of consideration could vary
from the present value assessed above. However, based on the overall quantum and sensitivity to changes
in assumed future growth rates, the range in potential outcomes of contingent consideration is considered
to be immaterial.

After fair value adjustments, goodwill of £7.1m is created on the consolidation of Ezi Floor which relates
to expected future profits of the business.

Transaction costs amounting to £155,000 relating to the acquisition have been recognised as an expense
and included in the administrative expenses in the Group Income Statement.

**(b) Dunlop Flooring**

The Group acquired the net assets of Dunlop Flooring through a newly incorporated company in Australia
namely Primary Flooring Pty Ltd. The new entity continues to trade under the Dunlop Flooring name.

Dunlop Flooring is the largest manufacturer and distributor of carpet underlay in Australia catering to
both the domestic and commercial markets. The two manufacturing plants are located at Sunshine, near
Melbourne and Wetherill Park, a suburb of Sydney.

Dunlop Flooring also sources, imports and distributes a range of hard flooring comprising laminates,
engineered wood and luxury vinyl plank under the ‘‘Heartridge’’ brand name. Exclusive product ranges are
also provided to key customers under the ‘‘Castleton’’ and ‘‘Invincible’’ brand names.

The acquisition of Dunlop Flooring is highly complementary to the Group’s existing businesses in Australia
with the addition of underlay and hard flooring ranges to the Group’s product portfolio which previously
consisted of only broadloom carpet and carpet tiles. The acquisition is expected to be immediately
accretive to the underlying earnings per share of the Company.

The Group results for the year ended April 1, 2017 include contribution from Dunlop Flooring A$8.7m
(£5.0m[1]) of revenue and A$0.8m (£0.5m[1]) of underlying profit before tax (before amortisation of acquired
intangibles, acquisition and reorganisation costs). If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of
the financial year Group revenue and underlying profit before tax would have been higher by A$45.4m
(£26.1m[1]) and A$4.7m (£2.7m[1]) respectively.

**Consideration**

Cash consideration of A$36.4m (£22.4m[2]) was paid on completion of the acquisition. There is no deferred
or contingent consideration.

of contractually collectable cash flows.

After fair value adjustments, goodwill of £7.1m is created on the consolidation of Dunlop Flooring, which

**(c) Avalon and GrassInc.**

On February 13, 2017 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Avalon B.V and GrassInc. B.V

Avalon and GrassInc. primarily supply artificial grass for domestic and landscaping purposes across
Europe. This is a very high growth—and high margin—segment of the flooring market.

The acquisitions continue Victoria’s strategy of growing its business with earnings-enhancing acquisitions,
and then using available synergies to drive further increases in profits. The Board believes that the
Acquisitions present an excellent strategic fit with Victoria’s existing business and will have strong
long-term growth prospects as part of the Group.

The Group results for the year ended April 1, 2017 include contribution from Avalon and GrassInc of
A3.0m (£2.6m[1]) of revenue and A0.7m (£0.6m[1]) of underlying profit before tax (before amortisation of
acquired intangibles, acquisition and reorganisation costs). If the acquisition had been completed on the
first day of the financial year Group revenue and underlying profit before tax would have been higher by
A16.7m (£14.2m[1]) and A3.3m (£2.8m[1]) respectively.

**Consideration**

The consideration for the acquisition comprises:

(i) Initial cash consideration of A11.2 million (£9.5m[2]);

(ii) Deferred cash consideration of A5.1 million (£4.3m[2]) payable in instalments over four years; and

(iii) Contingent cash consideration of up to approximately A8.8 million (£7.5m[2]) dependent on improved

**25. Financial instruments**

**Background**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks
and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout the financial statements.

There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from
previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.

The ‘‘financial instruments’’ which are affected by these risks comprise borrowings, cash and liquid
resources used to provide finance for the Group’s operations, together with various items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, inter-company payables and receivables,
and any derivatives transactions (such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) used
to manage the risks from interest rate and currency rate volatility.

**General objectives, policies and processes**

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports through which it reviews the effectiveness of
the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set
out below:

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and
investments.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed
locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are
obtained from reputable external sources. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss
event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction on the recoverability of the cash
flows.

F-104


-----

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**25. Financial instruments (Continued)**

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties
are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of
counterparties and customers.

The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the
performances of which are closely monitored. The Directors confirm that the carrying amounts of monies
owed by its subsidiaries approximate to their fair value.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and
principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have
sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.

To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed
facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days.

The Board monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts against actual cash position on a monthly
basis. At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient
liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

The maturity of financial liabilities is detailed in Note 16.

**Market risk**

Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is
the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign exchange rates (currency risk).

**(a) Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, equity capital and bank facilities,
including hire purchase and lease finance. The Group borrows in the desired currency at floating or fixed
rates of interest and may then use interest rate swaps to secure the desired interest profile and manage
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

**Interest rate sensitivity**

The annualised effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the
variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase
in post-tax profit for the year of £423,000 (2016: increase in post-tax profit of £284,000). A 50 basis point
increase in the interest rate would, on the same basis, have reduced the profit for the year by the same
amount.

**Borrowings contractual maturities and effective interest rate analysis**

In respect of interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates the undiscounted amounts
due for the remaining contractual maturity (including interest payments based on the outstanding liability
at the year end) and their effective interest rates. The ageing of these amounts is based on the earliest
dates on which the Group can be required to pay.

**Non-interest bearing liabilities**

Details of trade and other payables falling due within one year are set out in Note 15.

**(b) Currency risk**

The main currency exposure of the Group arises from the ownership of the Australian subsidiaries which
cumulatively account for approximately 23.9% of the Group’s net assets.

It is the Board’s policy not to hedge against movements in the Sterling/Australian Dollar and Sterling/Euro
exchange rate.

Other currency exposure derives from trading operations where goods are exported or raw materials and
capital equipment are imported. These exposures may be managed by forward currency contracts,
particularly when the amounts or periods to maturities are significant and at times when currencies are
particularly volatile.

**Currency risk sensitivity**

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australian Dollar against Sterling over the full year would, all
other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in Group post-tax profit for the year of £176,000
(2016: increased Group post-tax profit by £273,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the
same basis, have decreased Group post-tax profit by £144,000 (2016: decreased Group post-tax profit by
£223,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australia Dollar against Sterling at year-end rates would have
resulted in an increase to equity of £2,103,000 (2016: an increase of £1,491,000). A 10% weakening in the
exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased equity by £1,721,000 (2016: decrease of
£1,220,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Euro against Sterling over the full year would, all other variables
held constant, have resulted in a decrease in Group post-tax profit for the year of £68,000. A 10%
weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have increased Group post-tax profit by £48,000.

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Euro against Sterling at year-end rates would have resulted in an
decrease to equity of £69,000. A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have
decreased equity by £56,000.

The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary
liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

**(c) Trading**

It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.

**26. Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In applying the Group’s accounting policies, appropriate estimates have been made in a number of areas
and the actual outcome may vary from the position described in the Group’s and Company’s balance
sheets at April 1, 2017. The key sources of uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may give rise to a
material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as
follows:

**Realisation of deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets are recognised at the balance sheet date based on the assumption that there is a high
expectation that the asset will be realised in due course. This assumption is dependent on the UK &
Europe and Australia divisions’ ability to generate sufficient future taxable profits. Further details are set
out in Note 19.

**Valuation of deferred and contingent earn-out consideration**

Liabilities are recognised in respect of acquisitions with outstanding deferred or contingent earn-outs at
the end of the period. These are assessed based upon management forecasts for each business in question.
Key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices
and direct costs. Further details are set out in Note 17.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (Continued)**

**26. Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

**Valuation of acquired intangible assets**

Intangible assets are recognised on acquisitions in relation to customer relationships and brands. These are
assessed based upon management forecasts for each business in question. Key assumptions are those
regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs, brand royalty
rates and customer attrition. Further details are set out in Note 10.

**Impairment of goodwill**

On an annual basis the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying
value of goodwill is less than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of
expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. Details of assumptions used in
this review are detailed in Note 9.

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes. The obligations under the schemes are recognised in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by
independent actuaries, with input from the Directors. These actuarial valuations include assumptions such
as discount rates, return on assets and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from time to time according
to prevailing economic conditions.

Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising under
the scheme in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions. The effects of any change to these assumptions are accounted for in the next financial year as
other comprehensive income. The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefits is clearly
dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement.

Further details are set out in Note 20.

**Inventories**

A proportion of inventory is made up of stocks which are not expected to sell for the full normal selling
price, either because they are remnants, come from discontinued ranges, or are below the required quality
standard. This inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. During the year to April 1,
2017, the total movement in stock provisions resulted in a credit to the income statement of £189,000
(2016: charge of £220,000). Further details are set out in Note 13.

**Trade receivables**

Details of the provision made for non-recoverability of debts due to the Group from the sale of goods are
set out in Note 14.

**27. Related parties**

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.

**Identity of related parties**

The Group has a related party relationship with its Directors and executive officers.

The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and its Directors and executive officers.

**Transactions with key management personnel**

Key management personnel are considered to be the Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.

As at April 1, 2017, the key management personnel, and their immediate relatives controlled 33.0% of the
voting shares of the Company.

Goodwill is attributed to the businesses identified below for the purpose of testing impairment. These
businesses are the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and represent cash generating units
(‘‘CGU’’). The CGUs within a reported segment share similar characteristics to each other and to the
other businesses within that segment.

**37,205** 4,110

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill
might be impaired.

The recoverable amounts of the goodwill have been determined based on value in use calculations. The
key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and
expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. The discount rates used of 13.4% for
CGUs within the UK and 14.3% for CGUs within Australia are estimated using weighted-average costs of
capital that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
markets in which the businesses operate. The primary reason for the difference in this rate between the
UK and Australia is the difference in underlying interest rates.

The calculation uses cash flow projections extrapolated from the budget for the year ending April 1, 2017.
A terminal value was calculated based on a terminal growth rate assumption of 2.0%.

The Group does not consider it reasonably probable that any significant changes to the key assumptions
will arise that would result in impairment to any of the Goodwill balances. If the terminal growth rate was
assumed to be nil in the Director’s opinion there would still be no provision for impairment required. As at
April 2, 2016 no impairment provision was therefore considered necessary.

Goodwill comprises intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, in particular the existing
workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be tax deductible.

**Fair value measurement of financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are
grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of
significant inputs to the measurement as follows:

- Level one: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level two: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level one that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly

- Level three: unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities

All financial assets and liabilities have been identified as Level one with the exception of:

- Forward foreign exchange contracts, which are Level two financial assets/liabilities and all expire
within 12 months from April 2, 2016.

- The Group’s interest rate swap contract, which is a Level two financial asset and expires in May 2018.

The Group has relied upon valuations performed by third party valuations specialists for complex
valuations of the forward exchange contracts and the interest rate swap contract. Valuation techniques
have utilised observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the
contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for forward exchange contracts and the
interest rate swap contract.

- Contingent earn-out liabilities, which are Level three liabilities.

The fair value of the intangibles under level 3 are estimated using an income approach which capitalises
the estimated royalty income which would be charged to a third party to use the brand.

The most significant inputs, all of which are unobservable, are the estimated royalty rate and the discount
rate. The estimated fair value increases if the estimated royalty rate increases or the discount rate declines.
The overall valuations are sensitive to both assumptions.

The provision is based on taxation rates of 30% in respect of balances relating to the Australia businesses
(2015: 30%). The rates applied to UK balances vary dependent on the timing of when the balances are
expected to unwind as noted below.

**Effect on UK deferred tax balances of proposed changes in the UK corporation tax rate**

The UK corporation tax rate reduction from 20% to 19% on April 1, 2017 and to 18% on April 1, 2020
have been substantively enacted. Accordingly, deferred tax balances at April 2, 2016 have been calculated
at the rate at which the relevant balance is expected to be recovered or settled. The UK Finance Bill 2016
includes a reduction of the UK corporation tax rate to 17% on April 1, 2020. Once the UK Finance Bill
2016 substantively enacted, relevant deferred tax balances will be re-measured to 17%.

**21. Retirement benefit obligations**

**Defined contribution schemes**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The companies and the
employees contribute towards the schemes.

Contributions are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and amounted to £2,542,000 (2014:
£1,532,000), of which £1,742,000 (2015: £869,000) relates to the UK schemes. The total contributions
outstanding at year end was £nil (2015: £nil).

**Defined benefit schemes**

The Group has two defined benefit schemes, both of which relate to Interfloor Limited, which was
acquired during the period.

Interfloor Limited sponsors the Final Salary Scheme (‘‘the Main Scheme’’) and the Interfloor Limited
Executive Scheme (‘‘the Executive Scheme’’) which are both defined benefit arrangements. The defined
benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees
of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in
the scheme. The trustees of the pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the
assets of the fund.

The last full actuarial valuations of these schemes were carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at
July 31, 2015.

The contributions made by the employer over the financial period were £nil, (2015: £nil) in respect of the
Main Scheme and £nil (2015: £nil) in respect of the Executive Scheme.

Contributions to the Executive and Main Schemes are made in accordance with the Schedule of
Contributions. Future contributions are expected to be an annual premium of £95,000 in respect of the
Main Scheme and £126,000 contributions payable to the Executive Scheme. These payments are in line
with the certified Schedules of Contributions until they are reviewed on completion of the triennial
valuations of the schemes as at August 1, 2018.

As both schemes are closed to future accrual there will be no current service cost in future years.

The defined benefit schemes typically expose the company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk,
interest rate risk and longevity risk.

**Investment risk**

The present value of the defined benefit schemes’ liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by
reference to high quality corporate bond yields; if the returns on schemes’ assets are below this rate, it will
create a scheme deficit. Due to the long-term nature of the schemes’ liabilities, the trustees of the pension
fund consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the schemes’ assets should be invested in equity
securities to leverage the return generated by the funds.

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**21. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

**Interest risk**

A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the schemes’ liability but this will be partially offset by an
increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.

**Longevity risk**

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of
the schemes’ participants will increase the schemes’ liability.

The present value of the defined benefit liabilities were measured using the projected unit credit method.

The expected rates of return on plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall
expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated
balance in the plan’s investment portfolio.

Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position date were as follows:

**2016**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.6%
Revaluation rate of deferred pensioners of CPI or 5% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0%
Pension in payment increases of RPI or 5% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.9%
Pension in payment increases of CPI or 3% p.a. if less . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.8%
Inflation (RPI) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0%

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position date are based on 115% of the standard actuarial mortality tables and include an
allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65 year old
to live for a number of years as follows:

(i) Current pensioner aged 65: 20.8 years (male), 22.8 years (female).

(ii) Future retiree (aged 45) upon reaching 65: 22.1 years (male), 24.3 years (female).

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**21. Retirement benefit obligations (Continued)**

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate,
expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on
reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period,
while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate decreased by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase by 4.4%.

If the rate of inflation increases by 0.25% per annum, the defined benefit obligation would increase
by 3.3%.

If the life expectancy increases by one year for both men and women, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by 2.5%.

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as
some of the assumptions may be correlated.

In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been
calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as
that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

The Group expects to make a contribution of £221,000 (2015: nil) to the defined benefit schemes during
the next financial period.

The Company has one class of Ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income.

The Company issued 3,636,590 fully paid ordinary shares of 25p each during the year ended April 2, 2016.
Of this total, 2,906,856 shares were placed to fund the acquisition of Interfloor Group Limited in
September 2015. A further placing of 711,035 shares was undertaken in October 2015 to satisfy significant
institutional demand identified in response to this acquisition. A further 15,384 shares were issued to a
vendor of Globesign Limited in lieu of an element of deferred earn-out payment; 1,860 shares issued to a
manager in lieu of bonus entitlement and 1,455 shares issued in connection with the retailer incentive
scheme.

**Capital risk management**

The Group considers its capital to comprise its Ordinary share capital, share premium, accumulated
retained earnings and net debt. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its
continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital
growth and distributions.

In order to achieve this objective, the Group monitors its gearing to balance risks and returns at an
acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working
capital and strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these
aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group
considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

The Group is subjected to a number of financial covenants in connection with its UK bank facilities. These
covenants are tested quarterly and were not breached during the year.

**23. Reserves**

**(a) Retained earnings**

Consolidated retained earnings for the Group as at April 2, 2016 was £13,341,000 (2015: £8,915,000) which
included £4,827,000 (2015: £4,119,000) in respect of foreign exchange differences on consolidation of
overseas subsidiaries.

The profit of the Company for the year determined in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 was
£2,679,000 (2015: loss of £6,797,000) The Company is exempt under Section 408 of the Companies
Act 2006 from presenting its own Income statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income.

**(b) Other reserves**

The Company entered into a fully subordinated £10m 2022 unsecured loan note facility provided by the
Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) at the time of the acquisition of Abingdon Flooring group and granted
BGF an option for 746,000 new Victoria Plc ordinary 25p shares at an exercise price of £2.86 (together, the
‘BGF loan and option’). The BGF loan and option is accounted for as separate debt and equity
components (see Note 31(a)). The equity component was determined to have a fair value of £682,000.

**24. Acquisition of subsidiaries**

**(a) Quest Flooring**

On August 7, 2015, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Quest Carpet Manufacturers Pty
Limited and Quest Carpet Manufacturers Unit Trust (together ‘‘Quest Carpets’’).

The principle activity of Quest Carpets is the design, manufacture and distribution of carpets across
Australia and New Zealand. The business operates from facilities in Dandenong, near Melbourne,
Australia and employs a workforce of 89 people.

Quest Carpets is highly complementary to the Group’s existing business in Australia. The acquisition is
expected to be immediately accretive to the underlying earnings per share of the Company.

The Group results for the year ended April 2, 2016 included A$42.0m (£20.6m[1]) of revenue and A$4.1m
(£2.0m[1]) of profit before tax from Quest Carpets. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of
the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been A$23.2m (£11.5m[1]) higher and Group
profit before tax would have been A$3.2m (£1.6m[1]) higher.

**Consideration**

(i) Initial cash consideration of A$15.3m (£7.1m[2]).

(ii) Non-contingent deferred consideration of A$10.5m, payable in three equal annual instalments of
A$3.5m commencing in June 2016. This deferred consideration had a present value in Sterling as at
the acquisition date of £4.5m[2].

(iii) In addition, there are contingent payments in relation to rental property that was retained by the
vendors and leased back to the business, which has been treated as deferred consideration for the
purpose of assessing the total cost of the acquisition and goodwill created. These payments are made
annually over three years commencing in July 2016 and are equal to 50 per cent. of the EBITDA
generated by Quest Flooring for that year to 30 June in excess of A$7.0m.

Note 1—Applying the average GBP to AUD exchange rate over the financial year of 2.0327.

Note 2—Applying the GBP to AUD exchange rate at the time of the acquisition of 2.1388.

Other than where fair value adjustments have been made, the book values of asset acquired are considered
to approximate to their fair values. The gross contractual amounts of the trade receivables acquired are
considered to equate to the fair value of contractual cash flows to be collected.

Depending on the future performance of Quest Flooring, the contingent element of consideration could
vary from the present value assessed above. However, based on the overall quantum and sensitivity to
changes in assumed future growth rates, the range in potential outcomes of contingent consideration is
considered to be immaterial.

After fair value adjustments, goodwill of £6.8m is created on consolidation of Quest Flooring, which relates
to expected future profits of the business.

Transaction costs of £251,000 relating to the acquisition of Quest Flooring have been recognised as an
expense and included within administrative expenses in the Income Statement.

**(b) Interfloor Group Limited**

On September 11, 2015, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Interfloor Group Limited
(‘‘Interfloor Group’’).

The principle activity of Interfloor Group is the design, manufacture and distribution of carpet underlay
and related accessories. The business operates in the UK from facilities in Haslingden in Lancashire,
England, and Dumfries in Scotland, and employs a workforce of more than 300 people.

The acquisition of Interfloor Group will provide a number of commercial, operational and financial
benefits to the Group. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to the underlying earnings
per share of the Company.

Other than where fair value adjustments have been made, the book values of asset acquired are considered
to approximate to their fair values.

The fair value adjustment to freehold property is to reflect the difference between vacant possession
market value and book value in the acquired balance sheet.

The loan notes, which were assigned to Victoria PLC as part of the acquisition, attract no coupon and were
therefore adjusted from their nominal value to a lower fair value to reflect the discounting effect of a
market interest rate for such a loan.

Transaction costs of £721,000 relating to the acquisition of Interfloor Group have been recognised as an
expense and included within administrative expenses in the Income Statement.

**24. Acquisition of subsidiaries (Continued)**

**(c) A&A Carpets Limited**

On June 19, 2015, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Stott Holdings Limited and its
subsidiary, A&A Carpets Limited (together ‘‘A&A Carpets’’), a flooring distribution business. The
acquisition further enhances the Group’s marketing and distribution operations in the UK.

Cash consideration of £600,000 was paid, with transaction costs of £24,000 recognised within administrative
expenses. The fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities was a net assets position of £643,000. No
separately identifiable intangible assets were acquired. As a result, negative goodwill of £43,000 was
recognised in the year as a non-underlying income.

**25. Discontinued operations**

On October 2, 2015, the Group disposed of its wholly owned subsidiary, Westwood Yarns Limited. The
Group received cash consideration of £0.43m and recognised a net loss on disposal of £1.85m (non-cash

**28. Financial instruments**

**Background**

In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments. This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks

F-147


-----

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**28. Financial instruments (Continued)**

and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is
presented throughout the financial statements.

There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its
objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from
previous periods unless otherwise stated in this note.

The ‘‘financial instruments’’ which are affected by these risks comprise borrowings, cash and liquid
resources used to provide finance for the Group’s operations, together with various items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, inter-company payables and receivables,
and any derivatives transactions (such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) used
to manage the risks from interest rate and currency rate volatility.

**General objectives, policies and processes**

The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing
and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the
Group’s finance function. The Board receives monthly reports through which it reviews the effectiveness of
the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.

The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set
out below:

**Credit risk**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and
investments.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed
locally by the management of each business unit. Prior to accepting new customers, credit checks are
obtained from reputable external sources. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of
allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss
event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction on the recoverability of the cash
flows.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties
are banks with low credit risk assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of
counterparties and customers.

The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, other than with its own subsidiaries, the
performances of which are closely monitored. The Directors confirm that the carrying amounts of monies
owed by its subsidiaries approximate to their fair value.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and
principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in
meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have
sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.

To achieve this aim, the cash position is continuously monitored to ensure that cash balances (or agreed
facilities) meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days.

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**28. Financial instruments (Continued)**

The Board monitors annual cash budgets and updated forecasts against actual cash position on a monthly
basis. At the balance sheet date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient
liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

The maturity of financial liabilities is detailed in Note 17.

**Market risk**

Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. It is
the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign exchange rates (currency risk).

**a) Interest rate risk**

The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, equity capital and bank facilities,
including hire purchase and lease finance. The Group borrows in the desired currency at floating or fixed
rates of interest and may then use interest rate swaps to secure the desired interest profile and manage
exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

**Interest rate sensitivity**

The annualised effect of a 50 basis point decrease in the interest rate at the balance sheet date on the
variable rate debt carried at that date would, all other variables held constant, have resulted in a increase
in post-tax profit for the year of £284,000 (2015: decrease in post-tax loss of £110,000). A 50 basis point
increase in the interest rate would, on the same basis, have reduced the profit for the year by the same
amount.

**Borrowings, contractual maturities and effective interest rate analysis**

In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table
indicates their effective interest rates for the remaining contractual maturity based on the discounted cash
flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The bank
loans and BGF loan are disclosed in the table excluding prepaid finance costs.

**b) Currency risk**

The main currency exposure of the Group arises from the ownership of the two Australian subsidiaries,
which accounts for approximately 20% of the Group’s net assets.

It is the Board’s policy not to hedge against movements in the Sterling/Australian Dollar exchange rate.

Other currency exposure derives from trading operations where goods are exported or raw materials and
capital equipment are imported. These exposures may be managed by forward currency contracts,
particularly when the amounts or periods to maturities are significant and at times when currencies are
particularly volatile.

**Currency risk sensitivity**

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australian Dollar against Sterling over the full year would, all
other variables held constant, have resulted in an increase in Group post-tax profit for the year of
£273,000. (2015: decreased Group post-tax loss by £121,000). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate
would, on the same basis, have decreased Group post-tax profit by £223,000 (2015: increased Group
post-tax loss by £99,000).

The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Australia Dollar against sterling at year end rates would have
resulted in an increase to equity of £1,491,000 (2015: an increase of £1,318,000). A 10% weakening in the
exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased equity by £1,220,000 (2015: decrease of
£1,078,000).

The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary
liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

**Liabilities** **Assets**
**2016** **2015** **2016** **2015**
**£000** **£000** **£000** **£000**

**c) Trading**

It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.

**29. Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In applying the Group’s accounting policies, appropriate estimates have been made in a number of areas
and the actual outcome may vary from the position described in the Group’s and Company’s balance
sheets at April 2, 2016. The key sources of uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may give rise to a
material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as
follows:

**Deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets are recognised at the balance sheet date based on the assumption that there is a high
expectation that the asset will be realised in due course. This assumption is dependent on the UK and
Australia’s ability to generate sufficient future taxable profits.

**Deferred earn-out consideration and intangible asset valuations on acquisitions**

Details of the deferred earn-out consideration and intangible asset valuations on the acquisitions made
during the period are set out in Note 24.

**Impairment of Goodwill**

On an annual basis the Group is required to perform an impairment review to assess whether the carrying
value of goodwill is less than its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of

F-150


-----

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**29. Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

expected future cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. Details of assumptions used in
this review are detailed in Note 10.

**Defined benefit obligation**

The Group has two defined benefit pension schemes. The obligations under the schemes are recognised in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the present value of the obligation calculated by
independent actuaries, with input from the Directors. These actuarial valuations include assumptions such
as discount rates, return on assets and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from time to time according
to prevailing economic conditions.

Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising under
the scheme in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions. The effects of any change to these assumptions are accounted for in the next financial year as
other comprehensive income. The calculation of any charge relating to retirement benefits is clearly
dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement.

**Inventories**

A proportion of inventory is made up of stocks which are not expected to sell for the full normal selling
price, either because they are remnants, come from discontinued ranges, or are below the required quality
standard. This inventory is carried at a value which reflects the Directors’ best estimates of achievable
selling prices.

**Trade receivables**

Details of the provision made for non-recoverability of debts due to the Group from the sale of goods are
set out under Note 15.

**30. Related parties**

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.

**Identity of related parties**

The Group has a related party relationship with its Directors and executive officers.

The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and its directors and executive officers.

**Transactions with key management personnel**

Key management personnel are considered to be the directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.

As at April 2, 2016, the key management personnel, and their immediate relatives controlled 41.6% of the
voting shares of the Company.

**Transactions with the Business Growth Fund**

Gavin Petken, a Non-Executive Director of Victoria PLC, is the Business Growth Fund’s (‘BGF’) Regional
Director for the South. On the September 30, 2014 the Company entered into a £10m 2022 unsecured loan
facility with BGF. In addition, BGF has been granted an option over 746,000 new Ordinary 25p shares in
the Company at 286p per share, representing 5% of the Company’s deemed enlarged issued share capital
at the time of grant.

The BGF loan and option is accounted for as separate debt and equity components (see Note 31(a)).

Interest charged to the income statement during the period in relation to the BGF loan was £1,326,000
(2015: £724,000).

**31. Change in accounting policy and prior year adjustment**

**(a) Business Growth Fund loan and equity warrants**

There has been a change this year in the accounting treatment of the Business Growth Fund (‘BGF’) fully
subordinated £10m 2022 unsecured loan note facility and associated equity warrants (the ‘BGF loan and
option’). The loan note facility was previously treated as a £10m loan held on the balance sheet within
‘other financial liabilities’ along with accrued interest (totalling £164,000 as at the prior year-end) in
relation to a £2,133,560 redemption premium payable in 2019. Linked to the loan note facility, BGF own
warrants to acquire 746,000 shares in Victoria PLC at 286p per share, the total cost to BGF of exercising
these warrants being £2,133,560 (payable to the Company). As at March 28, 2015, a balance of £60,000 was
held in a share based payment reserve in relation to these warrants.

These instruments are now accounted for using split accounting which involves first determining the
carrying amount of debt component. This is done by measuring the net present value of the discounted
cash flows of interest and capital repayments, ignoring the possibility of exercise of the equity warrants.
The discount rate is the market rate at the time of inception for a similar liability that does not have an
associated equity instrument. On this basis the debt component, held within ‘other financial liabilities’, had
a fair value as at March 28, 2015 of £9,470,000, and the equity component, held within ‘other reserves’, a
fair value of £682,000. As at April 2, 2016, the fair value of the debt component had increased to
£9,796,000 due to the unwinding of the interest rate discount over time, with a £326,000 charge going to
finance costs in the income statement. This charge is split £146,000 within underlying interest charges and
£180,000 within non-underlying finance costs, the latter amount being the additional annual charge
associated with the redemption premium. In addition, there is non-underlying finance income of £72,000 in
the year relating to the difference in the recognised BGF liability as at March 28, 2015 under the two

F-152

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**31. Change in accounting policy and prior year adjustment (Continued)**

treatments (being the previous £60,000 share based payment reserve and a difference of £12,000.in interest
charge to that date).

Furthermore, in the prior year, prepaid finance costs, including those associated with the BGF loan and
option, were recognised within prepayments. These have now been offset against the relevant financial
liability in the balance sheet. Amortisation of these prepayments was previously included in the income
statement with administration costs and are now included within finance costs.

The resultant restatement of non-current financial liabilities and total equity for the Company as at
March 28, 2015 is summarised below.

The impact on the prior year income statement of the change in accounting treatment to split the debt and
equity components of the BGF loan and option is deemed to be immaterial and has therefore not been
adjusted.

**(b) New accounting policy in relation to sampling assets**

A new accounting policy has been adopted this year in relation to expenditure on sampling assets.
Sampling assets consist of a variety of product samples and sample books, as well as point of sale stands
designed to hold the samples. The cost of these assets was previously expensed as incurred. Under the new
policy, these assets are capitalised as fixed assets and depreciated.

The Group places sampling assets with retail customers for the purpose of helping to generate future
customer sales, and therefore sales for the Group. These assets are held by customers in their stores for a
period of time until the introduction of new colours or a new range by the Group, resulting in their
replacement. As such, it has been deemed appropriate to capitalise these assets on the Group’s balance
sheet to reflect their existence and expected future economic benefit, and to depreciate to the income
statement to match their cost against the revenue generated.

The Group’s consolidated accounts and all subsidiary accounts have been prepared on the basis of this new
accounting policy, with a prior-year adjustment reflected in the comparable figures. This includes a fully
retrospective adjustment to reflect the Group’s restated position and performance had this accounting

F-153

**Notes to the Accounts (Continued)**

**31. Change in accounting policy and prior year adjustment (Continued)**

policy been adopted historically. As such, the restated depreciation charge in the year includes charges in
relation to sampling assets acquired in previous financial years.

Sampling assets have been classed as ‘Fixtures, vehicles and equipment’ and sit within this category as
presented in Note 12.

The useful economic life of these assets has been prudently estimated to be 24 months, and all sampling
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over this time period.

The impact on the Group’s consolidated income statement in the prior year is summarised below.

Operating profit on the previous basis includes a £79,000 adjustment in relation to amortisation of prepaid
finance costs, which was previously included within administration costs and has been reallocated to
interest charges.

The change in underlying operating profit results from timing differences between the acquisition of
sampling assets and the aggregate depreciation profile. The reduction in exceptional operating items
relates to the fact that the net book value of these assets under the new accounting policy on the Abingdon
Flooring acquired balance sheet is greater than the assessed goodwill arising from the acquisition at the
time; with the resultant difference being treated as an exceptional acquisition related income, as required
by IFRS.

The impact on the Group’s earnings per share in the prior year is summarised below.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Sole Shareholder of Keraben Grupo, S.A.U.,

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. (the Company), which comprise the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2017, and the statement of profit or loss, statement of changes in equity,
statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements for the year then ended.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the equity
and financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017, and its results and its cash flows for the
year then ended in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the
Company (identified in Note 2-a to the financial statements) and, in particular, with the accounting
principles and rules contained therein.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Our responsibilities
under those regulations are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
_Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those
pertaining to independence, that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Spain pursuant to
the audit regulations in force. In this regard, we have not provided any services other than those relating to
the audit of financial statements and there have not been any situations or circumstances that, in
accordance with the aforementioned audit regulations, might have affected the requisite independence in
such a way as to compromise our independence.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Most Significant Audit Matters**

The most significant audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were considered
to be the most significant risks of material misstatement in our audit of the financial statements of the
current period. These risks were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on those risks.

**Other Information: Directors’ Report**

The other information comprises only the directors’ report for 2017, the preparation of which is the
responsibility of the Company’s directors and which does not form part of the financial statements.

Our audit opinion on the financial statements does not cover the directors’ report. Our responsibility
relating to the directors’ report, in accordance with the applicable audit regulations, consists of evaluating
and reporting on whether the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements, based on our
knowledge of the entity obtained in the audit of those financial statements and excluding any information
other than that obtained as evidence during the audit. Also, our responsibility consists of evaluating and
reporting on whether the content and presentation of the directors’ report are in conformity with the

F-157


-----

applicable regulations. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there are material
misstatements, we are required to report that fact.

Based on the work performed, as described in the preceding paragraph, the information in the directors’
report is consistent with that contained in the financial statements for 2017 and its content and
presentation are in conformity with the applicable regulations.

**Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements**

The directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying financial statements so that they present
fairly the Company’s equity, financial position and results in accordance with the regulatory financial
reporting framework applicable to the Company in Spain, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the
Appendix to this auditor’s report. This description, which is on pages 5 and 6, forms part of our auditor’s
report.

**Appendix to our auditor’s report**

Further to the information contained in our auditor’s report, in this Appendix we include our
responsibilities in relation to the audit of the financial statements.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

As part of an audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain, we exercise professional
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the use by the directors of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as
a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the entity’s directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

From the significant risks communicated with the entity’s directors, we determine those risks that were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the most
significant assessed risks.

We describe those risks in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter.

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2017**

**1. Company Business**

Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. (hereinafter, the Company) was incorporated on 2nd March 1974 for an indefinite
time. Its registered office is at Carretera Valencia—Barcelona, Km. 44.3, in the town of Nules (Castellon),
where its main production facilities and the place in which it engages in its business is located.

According to its Articles of Association, the Company’s corporate purpose comprises the following
activities:

- The manufacture, through all stages and processes, and the commercialization, including the
purchase, sale, import, export, representation, wholesale and retail distribution, directly or on
commission, and the transportation of all kinds of ceramic goods and products and their derivatives,
supplementary or accessory items, especially floor tiles, wall tiles, bricks, clays, frits, colours, varnishes,
bisques and similar items of all kinds, along with chemical ceramic items for the said industrial
processes and any other article or material that is manufactured with the use of fire and that either
serves as a raw material for the ceramic industry in the broadest sense or is itself a completely or
partially finished product in the said industry.

- The provision of all kinds of services, advice and technical assistance in relation to the industries and
products listed above.

- The trading and the leasing (excluding financial leasing) of any properties belonging to the Company
itself or to third parties.

- The production and sale of electrical and thermal energy through co-generation.

- The possession, direction and management of holdings in other companies through the corresponding
organisation of material and human resources.

The main activity engaged by the Company during the financial year 2017 consisted on the manufacture
and marketing of ceramic floor and wall tiles.

The Company is the parent of a group of companies at 31[st] December 2017, but has not elaborated the
consolidated annual accounts, for being exempt from this obligation, in accordance with current
regulations, since they have direct shareholding on subsidies which do not possess a significant interest,
neither, individually nor as a whole, for the faithful image of its net equity value, its financial situation and
the group’s results, and since it is integrated within a group of superior consolidation, according to what is
indicted in the following section of this note. On the other hand, the consolidated annual accounts of
Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. and its dependent companies for the 2016 financial year were approved in the
General Meeting of Shareholders of Keraben Grupo, S.A.U. on the 30th of June 2017 and filed at
Castellon Mercantile Registry.

**Changes in Company’s Shareholders in the year 2017**

At 31[st] of December 2016, the Company belonged to a group of companies whose direct parent was
Tensile-Keraben Holdings, S.`a.r.l., which is domiciled in Luxembourg, and the group’s ultimate parent
company was Tensile Capital GP LLC, which is domiciled in the USA.

With date 16[th] November 2017, the sale’s agreement of 100% of the Company’s shares was formalized in
public deed. After the formalization of this event, the actual sole shareholder of the Company is Kinsan
Trade, S.L. The Company, therefore, is subjected to the sole shareholder regime, having communicated
this circumstance to the Mercantile Registry. Such regime, establishes the obligation of the Company,
among other issues, to show the memorandum, a breakdown of all the contracts or agreements maintained
with its sole shareholder. (See Note 17).

As a consequence, at 31[st] of December 2017, the Company is integrated inside Kinsan Trade Group, whose
parent company is Kinsan Trade, S.L., and domiciled in Barcelona. The consolidated annual accounts of
Kinsn Trade Group will be filed in at Barcelona Mercantile Registry, and its elaboration is planned to be
performed within the legal established period of time. The annual consolidated accounts of Kinsan Trade
Group for 2017 will be the first one to be ever elaborated. At the same time, Kinsan Trade Group,

integrates within a group of companies whose ultimate parent company is Victoria PLC, domiciled in
United Kingdom and listed in Lomdon’s Alternative Investment Market.

This sale of the Company’s shares agreement has supposed, fundamentally, the following implications:

- Previous disinvestment process of financial and real estate assets not linked to the Company’s core
business activity during the years 2016 and 2017 (See notes 7 and 8).

- Accounting of several non-recurrent expenses linked to the sale transaction (See noted 15 and 18).

- Formalization of a new financing contract with the ultimate parent company on which the Company
integrates into (See note 17-b).

They thus show a faithful image of the Company’s worth, financial situation, results and cash flow
movements during the financial year. In particular, preparing these annual accounts, the Company’s
Directors applied the principles governing a company that is currently trading, since in their opinion there

**2. Bases for presentation (Continued)**

**_d)_** **_Critical aspects relating to the valuation and assessment of uncertainty_**

While preparing these annual accounts, estimates made by the Company’s Directors have been used in
order to place a value on some of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and undertakings shown in the
accounts themselves. These estimates basically refer to the following:

- The assessment of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets (see notes 4-d, 4-f and 4-g).

- The useful life of intangible assets, tangible assets and real estate investments (see notes 4-a, 4-b and
4-c).

- The fair value of certain financial instruments (note 4-f).

- The forecast future taxable profits that make it probable that deferred tax assets will be recovered
(note14)

- The calculation of certain allowance coverage amounts (see note 4-l).

Despite the fact that these estimates have been made on the basis of the best information available at the
end of the financial year 2017, it is possible that events occurring in the future may make it necessary to
modify them (either upwards or downwards) in coming years. This will be carried out, where necessary, in
the form of a prospective analysis.

In the year 2017, the Company has incurred losses as a consequence, fundamentally, to the accrual of
specific non-recurrent expenses linked the sale of shares agreement stated in note 1. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company’s profit and loss accounts of the last years show positive operating margins and net
profit. Additionally, the operating margin of the year 2017, without considering non-recurrent expenses,
raises to a positive amount of 33.825 thousand of euros.

Likewise, At 31[st] of December 2017, the balance sheet shows a positive working capital by an amount of
30,747 thousand euros, and a net equity of 41,332 thousand euros. The company has all the financial
support of the Group in which is integrated and that is materialized in the financing received (see
note 17-b).

In this respect, the business plan developed by the company’s managers foresees that it will continue to
reach increasing levels of activity in the coming years, obtaining levels of profitability from its stable
operations and generating the necessary financial resources to attend its liabilities. As a consequence, the
administrators of the company consider that it will be able to fulfil all its commitments in the coming years
so that these current accounts have been prepared according to the operating company principle.

**_e)_** **_Comparison of information_**

The information in these annual accounts relating to the 2016 financial year is presented solely for the
purposes of comparison with the information financial year 2017.

**_f)_** **_Grouping of entries_**

Certain entries in the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the statement of changes to net equity
value and the cash flow statement are grouped together in order to facilitate understanding, though where
information is particularly significant it is shown in broken down form in the corresponding notes to the
accounts.

**_g)_** **_Changes to accounting criteria_**

There were no significant changes to accounting criteria during 2017 in comparison with the criteria
applied during 2016.

**_h)_** **_Correction of errors_**

During the preparation of these annual accounts, no significant errors were detected that involved
re-entering the amounts included in the annual accounts for the 2016 financial year.

**3. Application of the result**

The proposal for the application of the result, which has been drawn up by the Company’s Directors for
the fiscal year 2017, pendant of approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, is the allocation of the
losses incurred in the year to the entry ‘‘Negative Results from previous years’’.

**4. Entry and valuation rules**

The main entry and valuation rules used by the Company when preparing its annual accounts for the
financial year 2017, pursuant to the rules set out in the Spanish General Chart of Accounts, were as
follows:

**_a)_** **_Intangible fixed assets_**

As a general rule, intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost of acquisition or production cost.
Subsequently, they are valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where
applicable, minus losses incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in note 4-d.
These assets are depreciated on the basis of their useful life.

The Company enters any loss that may have occurred in the registered value of these assets as the result of
their impairment in the accounts, using the entry headed ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of
fixed assets’’ in the profit and loss account as a contra entry. The criteria used to recognise losses due to
the impairment of these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of any losses due to impairment entered
in previous financial years are similar to those applied to tangible fixed assets, as explained in section d) of
this note.

_Research and development costs_

The Company adheres to the criterion of entering the research and development costs that it has incurred
over the course of the year in the profit and loss account. However, research and development costs
become active when the following requirements are met:

- They are specifically individually defined by project and the cost can be clearly established.

- There are justifiable reasons to trust in the technical success and financial and commercial
profitability of the project.

Any assets generated in this way are depreciated using the straight-line method over the course of their
useful life (a maximum of five years). In addition, where there are doubts regarding the technical success
or economic viability of the project, the amounts entered on the assets side of the balance sheet are
attributed directly to the profit and loss account for the financial year.

_Patents, licences, trademarks and similar_

This heading includes the amounts paid to acquire patents and register the Company’s trademarks, and
items are valued initially at cost of acquisition or production cost, including registration and formal
certification costs. They are depreciated using the straight-line method over 10 years.

This also includes the valuation of identifiable commercial trademarks that have emerged from the
combination of businesses during previous financial years. Trademarks are valued at their fair value on the
date of acquisition, minus the amount of the negative difference emerging from the said combination.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

_IT applications_

IT applications include software acquired from third parties, and they are entered at their acquisition
price, which includes all the costs incurred until their effective entry into operation. These assets are
depreciated using the straight-line method over a five-year period, from the moment that each application
enters operation.

Repair and maintenance costs incurred during the financial year are charged to the profit and loss account.
In this regard, charges in the form of maintenance services are entered as a cost in the profit and loss
account in the financial year in which they are incurred.

**_b)_** **_Tangible fixed assets_**

Tangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost of acquisition or production cost, and subsequently
valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, minus losses
incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in note 4-d.

The cost of replacing or refurbishing complete items and the cost of extending, modernising or improving
items in order to extend their useful life, productivity or economic yield are entered as a higher cost of the
tangible fixed asset in question, with the corresponding removal of the replaced or refurbished items.

Regular maintenance, conservation and repair costs are entered against the results, using the accrual
principle, as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

Any work carried out by the Company in relation to its own fixed assets is entered at the accumulated cost
that results from adding external costs to internal costs, calculated on the basis of the materials used, direct
labour costs and general manufacturing costs, based on rates of absorption similar to those applied for the
purposes of making stock valuations.

Where applicable, if a fixed asset requires a period of more than one year in order to reach operational
condition, capitalised costs will include any financial costs that have accrued prior to the item coming into
operation and have been charged by the supplier or result from loans or other forms of outside financing,
either specific or general, that are directly attributable to the acquisition or manufacture of the item in
question. The Company did not capitalise any amount in this regard during the financial years 2017 and
2016.

The Company depreciates tangible fixed assets by applying annual depreciation percentages calculated on
the basis of the estimated length of the useful life of such assets, as set out below:

**Estimated Useful**
**Asset Type** **Life (years)** **Method**

Constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30–65 Straight line
Technical equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . 10–16 Straight line and declining balance
Other facilities, tools and furnishings . . . . . . . . . . 3–25 Straight line
Other fixed assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3, 12–6, 25 Straight line

Useful life and amortization method are regularly reviewed in order to ensure that the method and term
used to calculate depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of profit generation relating to the
intangible fixed asset element in question, and this is adjusted prospectively in the profit and loss account.

Investments that cannot be separated from items used under leasing arrangements classified as operational
leases are entered as tangible fixed assets when they meet the requirements for definition as assets. These
investments are depreciated on the basis of their useful life, which will be the length of the lease or
assignment agreement, including any renewal term when there is evidence to support the fact that such a
renewal is going to occur, and when this is shorter than the economic life of the asset.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2017 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_c)_** **_Real estate investments_**

This section includes the values of land, buildings and other constructions that are maintained either for
exploitation under lease or to obtain a capital gain upon their sale, as a consequence of any increase in
their respective market prices that may apply in the future. For these assets, the Company applies the
valuation rules relating to tangible fixed assets.

**_d)_** **_Value impairment of intangible fixed assets, tangible fixed assets and real estate investments_**

At the end of each financial year, whenever there are signs of a fall in value, the Company uses the
so-called impairment test to estimate the possible existence of a fall in value that may reduce the
recoverable value of such assets to an amount that is lower than their book value. The recoverable value is
calculated as either the fair value minus sale costs or the operational value, whichever is higher. In the
event that the asset does not in itself generate cash flows independently from other assets, the Company
calculates the recoverable value of the cash flow-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

During the financial years 2017 and 2016, the Company entered certain impairments in relation to some of
its real estate assets (see note 7).

**_e)_** **_Leases_**

Leases are classified as financial leases whenever it can be concluded from the terms and conditions of the
leases that the risks and benefits inherent in ownership of the asset forming the subject of the agreement
are transferred substantially to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operational leases.

_Financial leases_

In the financial leasing transactions in which the Company acts as lessee, the cost of the leased assets is
entered in the balance sheet on the basis of the nature of the item forming the subject of the agreement,
and a liability in the same amount is simultaneously entered. This amount will be the lower of either the
fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum amounts agreed at the beginning of the
lease, including any purchase option, when there is no reasonable doubt regarding the exercise of such an
option. This calculation will not include fees of a contingent nature, service costs or taxes that are
chargeable to the lessor. The total financial charge for the agreement is entered in the profit and loss
account for the financial year in which it is accrued, applying the effective interest rate method. Fees of a
contingent nature are entered as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

Assets recorded for this kind of transaction are depreciated using criteria that are similar to the ones
applied to tangible fixed assets as a whole, taking account of their nature.

The minimum amount of fees to be paid or received according to financial leasing contracts on which the
Company appears as lessee or lessor, are not significant regarding the current annual accounts.

_Operational leases_

Operational leases are understood to be leases under which the lessor agrees to grant the lessee the right
to use an asset over a specific period of time in return for a single payment or a series of payments or fees,
so long as this is not a lease of a financial nature.

Any costs resulting from operational lease agreements are entered in the profit and loss account in the
financial year in which they are incurred.

Any charge or payment that may be made when arranging an operational lease will be treated as an
advance charge or payment and entered against the results over the term of the lease, as the benefits from
the leased asset are assigned or received.

which the Company is respectively named as either lessor or lessee is not significant in relation to these
annual accounts.

**_f)_** **_Financial instruments_**

_Financial assets_

_Classification and initial valuation_

The financial assets owned by the Company are classified in the following categories:

a) Loans and accounts receivable: financial assets originating from the sale of goods or the provision of
services as part of the company’s normal business activities, or financial assets that, while not
originating from commercial operations, are not equity instruments or derivatives; any payments
collected are of a fixed and quantifiable amount and they are not traded on the markets.

b) Investments in the equity of group and associate companies: group companies are understood to be
those that are linked to the Company via a controlling relationship, while associated companies are
those over which the Company exercises a significant influence.

c) Guarantee bonds and deposits: these are entered in the amounts in which they were originally put in
place, which do not significantly differ from their fair value.

The financial assets included in the various categories indicated above are initially entered, in general
terms, at the fair value of the consideration handed over in payment plus any costs that can be directly
attributed to the transaction.

_Subsequent valuation_

Loans and accounts receivable are valued at their depreciated cost.

Investments in group and associated companies are valued at cost, minus, where applicable, the
accumulated value of any adjustments for impairment. These adjustments are calculated as the difference
between their book value and their recoverable value, which is understood to be either their fair value
minus sale costs, or the present value of future cash flows earned from the investment, whichever is higher.
In the absence of better evidence of the amount that may be recoverable, account is taken of the net equity
value of the subsidiary company, corrected by any unrealised capital gains that exist on the valuation date
(including goodwill, where it exists).

The Company is the main shareholder of various companies (see note 8). The Company has not applied
consolidation criteria in the current annual accounts as, in accordance with current regulations, it is exempt
of the elaboration of consolidated annual accounts as indicated in note 1.

The Company carries out an impairment test, at least at the end of each financial year, on any financial
assets that are not entered at their reasonable value. It is considered that there is objective evidence of
impairment if the recoverable value of the financial asset is lower than its book value. When such
impairment occurs, this is entered in the profit and loss account. In particular, as regards value adjustments
relating to commercial debtors and other accounts receivable, the rule used by the Company to calculate
the relevant value adjustments is to classify the amounts owing as doubtful debts.

_Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities are debts and accounts payable that are owed to the Company and that have originated
from the purchase of goods or services during the company’s ordinary business operations, along with any
liabilities that do not have a commercial origin and cannot be regarded as derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Company classified all of its short-term financial liabilities as debts
and accounts payable.

F-171

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.U.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2017 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

Debts and accounts payable are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration received, adjusted to
take account of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are valued according
to their depreciated cost.

The Company removes financial liabilities when the obligations that gave rise to them disappear.

_Net Equity Instruments_

A Net Equity Instrument represents a residual shareholding in the equity of a Company, once all its
liabilities have been deducted.

The Net Equity Instruments emitted by the Company are registered in the net equity by the amount
received, net from expenses linked to its emission.

**_g)_** **_Stocks_**

Stocks are valued at their acquisition price, production price or net realizable value, whichever is the
lowest. Commercial discounts, lower prices obtained, other similar amounts and the interest included in
the base number of debited items are deducted when calculating the acquisition price. Discounts for
prompt payment are also included as a lower purchase price, whether shown in the invoice or not.

The production cost includes direct material costs and, where applicable, direct labour costs and general
manufacturing costs.

The net realizable value represents an estimate of the sale price minus all the costs that are estimated in
order to complete manufacture, plus any costs that will be incurred during the course of the marketing,
sales and distribution processes.

When allocating value to its inventories, the Company uses the FIFO method.

The Company makes the appropriate value adjustments, entering them as a cost in the profit and loss
account, when the net realisable value of stocks is lower than their cost of acquisition (or production cost).

**_h)_** **_Subsidies, donations and bequests received_**

When accounting subsidies, donations and bequests received, the Company applies the following rules:

a) Non-repayable subsidies, donations and bequests: These are valued at the fair value of the amount
granted or item received, depending on whether or not it is in monetary form, and they are entered in
the results in proportion to the amount allocated to depreciation of the item benefiting from the
subsidy over the period or, where applicable, when it is disposed of or a value adjustment is made for
its impairment, with the exception of amounts received from members or owners, which are entered
directly as shareholder equity and do not constitute any kind of income.

b) Repayable subsidies: While they remain repayable, they are entered as liabilities.

c) Operating subsidies: These are entered in the results at the time at which they are awarded, unless
they are used to finance operational deficits in future years, in which case they are entered in the
relevant financial year. If they are awarded in order to finance specific costs, they are entered as the
costs being financed accrue.

**_i)_** **_Transactions in foreign currency_**

The operational currency used by the Company is the euro. Consequently, all transactions in currencies
other than the euro are regarded as being denominated in foreign currency and entered according to the
rates of exchange that apply on the transaction date.

At the end of the financial year, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are
converted at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet. Any profit or loss that emerges is
entered directly in the profit and loss account for the financial year in which it occurs.

**_j)_** **_Tax on profits_**

The cost or income from tax on profits comprises the part that relates to the cost or income from current
tax and the part that corresponds to the cost or income due to deferred tax.

Current tax is the amount that the Company pays as a consequence of the tax payable on the income it has
earned during the financial year. Any deductions or other tax advantages that apply to the tax amount,
excluding withheld taxes and payments on account, plus any tax losses that can be offset from previous
financial years and that can be applied during the current year, lead to a decrease in the current tax
amount.

The cost or income from deferred tax corresponds to the recognition and cancellation of assets and
liabilities resulting from deferred taxes. These include the time-period differences identified as amounts
that are expected to be payable or recoverable due to the difference between the asset and liability
amounts shown in the books and their taxable value, together with any negative tax bases that are pending
offset and credits due as the result of deductions against tax that are not fiscally applied. These amounts
are entered by applying the time-period difference or corresponding credit to the tax rate at which they are
expected to be recovered or paid.

All time-period differences are entered as deferred tax liabilities, except for those that originate from the
initial entry of goodwill or other assets and liabilities in operations that do not affect either the tax result or
the book result and do not constitute a combination of businesses.

Meanwhile, deferred tax assets are only entered to the extent that it is considered probable that the
Company will earn sufficient tax profits in the future for them to be offset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from operations that lead to direct charges or payments being
entered as asset entries are also accounted for with a contra entry in net equity value.

Upon closing each set of accounts, the deferred tax assets recorded are reappraised and the relevant
adjustments are made in the event that there are any doubts regarding their future recovery. Any deferred
tax assets not recorded in the balance sheet are also appraised at the close of each year, and these are
entered in the accounts whenever it becomes probable that they could be recovered against future taxable
profits.

**_k)_** **_Income and expenses_**

Income and expenses are entered on the basis of accrual criteria, i.e. at the time of the actual flow of goods
and services that they represent, regardless of the time at which the monetary or financial flow resulting
from such goods and services occurs. Income is valued at the fair value of the payment received minus
discounts and taxes.

Income from sales is entered at the moment that all significant risk and benefit inherent in ownership of
the item being sold is transferred to the purchaser, and neither current management of that item nor
effective control there over are subsequently maintained.

As regards income from the provision of services, this is recognised on the basis of the degree to which
such services have been completed on the date of the balance sheet, provided that the results of the
transaction can be reliably estimated.

Interests received from financial assets are entered on the basis of the effective interest rate method, while
dividends are entered when the shareholders’ right to receive them is announced. In any case, any interest
or dividends accruing on financial assets subsequent to their acquisition are entered as income in the profit
and loss account.

**_l)_** **_Provisions and contingencies_**

When preparing these annual accounts, the Company’s Directors have differentiated between the
following:

- Provisions: liabilities covering obligations that remained outstanding on the date of the balance sheet
as a consequence of past events that are likely to emerge and could result in damage to the Company’s
assets of an unknown value and over an unknown time. These amounts are entered on the balance
sheet in the form of allowance provisions in the current most probable value that the Company
estimates it would have to pay in order to be released from the obligation, and

- Contingent liabilities: potential obligations arising as a consequence of past events, the emergence of
which is conditional upon whether or not one or more future events arise that are beyond the control
of the Company.

These annual accounts record all the significant provisions in respect of which it is estimated that there is a
probability that the obligation will need to be covered. Contingent liabilities are not entered in the annual
accounts, though information on such liabilities is given insofar as they are not classified as remote.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the best possible estimate of the amount that will be required
to cancel or transfer the obligation, bearing in mind all available information relating to the event and its
consequences, and any adjustments arising as a result of the updating of such provisions are entered as a
financial cost as they accrue.

Any compensation to be received from a third party at the time at which the obligation is settled, provided
that there is no doubt that such compensation will be received, is entered as an asset, except in the event
there is a legal connection through which part of the risk has been outsourced, under which the Company
will not be obliged to assume liability; in this situation, the compensation will be taken into account when
estimating the amount that is to be recorded, where applicable, for the provision in question.

**_m)_** **_Asset items of an environmental nature_**

Asset items of an environmental nature are understood to be lasting assets that are used during the course
of the Company’s activities for the main purpose of minimising environmental impact, protecting and
improving the environment, including the reduction or elimination of future contamination.

The tangible fixed asset items designed to minimise any environmental impact that could result from the
activities engaged in by the Company are valued at cost price, adjusted by their accumulated depreciation.

Any extension, modernisation and improvement costs are capitalised when they represent an extension of
the estimated useful life of the assets in question. Otherwise they are treated as costs for that financial
year, along with repair and maintenance costs.

Any costs that are incurred in relation to the protection and improvement of the environment and that do
not represent an investment in tangible fixed assets are entered in the results for the year in which they are
incurred, regardless of the time at which the cash or financial stream resulting from such costs materialises.

Amounts incurred in the management of environmental effects resulting from the business activities
engaged in by the company are classified as environmental costs, as are the costs that result from the
Company’s existing environmental undertakings. These include the costs incurred as a result of preventing
pollution in relation to the Company’s current operational activities, the treatment of residue and waste,
decontamination, restoration, environmental management and environmental auditing.

The Company follows the rule of accounting for any potential undertakings at the moment at which it
becomes aware of them.

Allowance provision for probable or certain environment-related liabilities, on-going lawsuits and pending
compensation and obligations of an undetermined amount, where not covered by the insurance policies

that have been taken out, is set aside at the moment that the liability or obligation that will result in
compensation or payment arises.

**_n)_** **_Greenhouse gas emission rights_**

Greenhouse gas emission rights, which are used for the cancellation of the obligation derived from the
emissions developed by the company, were reclassified as stocks. In the same way, emission rights hold to
be sold were registered.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of a right is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ are entered in the balance sheet when the company becomes eligible for
such rights. When such rights are acquired free of charge or at a price that is substantially lower than their
market value, the acquisition price is considered to be their market price at the time of acquisition or at the
beginning of the calendar year. In this case, they will be entered with a contra entry under ‘‘Subsidies,
donations and bequests received’’ in the Net Equity Value section of the balance sheet, once any deferred
tax associated with them has been deducted.

After being entered as an asset, emission rights are valued at their acquisition price or production price
under stocks. The necessary provisions are set aside in order to give them their lower market value at the
end of each financial year, whenever their book value may not be recoverable from the generation of
sufficient income to cover all costs and expenses.

Costs attached to the emission of greenhouse gases require the corresponding provision to be made for
risks and costs, and this provision is maintained until the moment that the Company has to cancel the
obligation in question by handing over the corresponding emission rights.

Costs accrue as greenhouse gases are emitted, and they are entered under ‘‘Other operating costs-Costs
from emission of greenhouse effect gasses’’ in the attached profit and loss accounts for 2017 and 2016,
calculated according to the emission rights that have been transferred.

Subsidies of a non-repayable nature associated with emission rights acquired free of charge or at a price
that is substantially below their market price are entered as ‘‘Subsidies, donations and bequests received’’
and charged to the profit and loss account in the same proportion as the costs incurred from the gas
emissions relating to the subsidised emission rights.

**_o)_** **_Severance Payment_**

According to current legislation, the Company has the obligation to pay a compensation to those
employees, which, under specific conditions, rescind their labour relationship. Therefore, the severance
payments susceptible of reasonable quantification, will be registered as an expense of the year on which the
decision of dismissal is communicated and adopted. In the current annual accounts, no provisions under
this concept have been registered, as situations of this nature are not predicted to occur.

**_p)_** **_Related party transactions_**

The Company carries out all related party transactions at market prices. In addition, its transfer pricing
policy is properly supported on the basis of the requirements set out in current tax legislation, and the
Company’s Directors therefore believe that there are no significant risks in this regard that could give rise
to liabilities worthy of consideration in the future.

**_q)_** **_Classification of Current and non-current balances_**

Current assets are understood to be assets that are linked to the normal business cycle, which is generally
regarded a one-year period, and the term is also understood to apply to assets that are due to maturity or
be disposed of or realised in the short term following the end of the financial year, financial assets

maintained for negotiation and cash and other equivalent liquid assets. Assets that do not meet these
requirements are classified as non-current.

Similarly, current liabilities are liabilities that are linked to the normal business cycle, financial liabilities
maintained for negotiation (excluding financial derivatives with a settlement term of more than one year)
and, in general, all obligations that are due to mature or be cancelled in the short-term. Otherwise they are
classified as non-current.

**Patents, licences, trademarks and similar**

The amount of 14,008 thousand of euros has been entered under ‘‘trademarks’’ in the section headed
‘‘Patents, licences, trademarks and similar’’, as the result of a valuation made by the Company’s directors
during the 2010 financial year in the context of the amalgamation of businesses that occurred in that year
(see note 1).

The Company’s directors cannot reliably estimate a foreseeable limit to the period during which this
trademark can be expected to generate net cash revenues for the Company, and the trademark has been
therefore amortized, pursuant to the applicable accounting regulations, over a ten-year period, applying,
(in the event that there are signs of any impairment), an ‘‘impairment’’ test will be applied, in accordance
with the methodology described in note 2-d.

**6. Tangible Fixed Assets**

**Information relating to additions and transfers**

The majority of the additions in 2017 and 2016, along with the balance shown under the heading ‘‘Advances
and fixed assets under construction’’, correspond to improvements to the Company’s production facilities,
which are scheduled to be completed over the coming years, as part of the investment plan approved by the
Board of Directors.

In the year 2017, transfers have taken place whose net book value has raised up to 202 thousand of euros
under the heading ‘‘Real Estate Investments’’, as the Company has started using the assets transferred
within its recurrent operations.

**Information relating to removals**

The removals during 2017 and 2016, correspond to some items that have been sold during the financial
period by a total amount of 300 thousand of euros (134 thousands of euros in 2016), and others that have
been deregistered. The net result of these deregistration is a loss of an amount of 14 thousand of euros,
which is entered under the heading ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of fixed assets—Results
from sale of assets and other’’ on the attached profit and loss account for the financial year 2017 (profit of
an amount of 12 thousand of euros in 2016).

**6. Tangible Fixed Assets (Continued)**

The totality of tangible assets is used by the company itself, not existing at the year-end of 2017 and 2016,
any element ceded to third parties under lease.

At year-end of 2017 and 2016 there are no firm commitments of tangible asset purchases.

At year-end of 2017 and 2016, tangible assets do not include assets acquired to group companies by
significant amounts.

It is the Company’s policy to take out the insurance policies necessary to cover any potential risk to which
its fixed asset items may be exposed. At the end of the 2017 and 2016 financial years, the net book value of
its fixed assets was completely covered by these insurance policies.

At 31st December 2016, the Company’s land and constructions were mortgaged in guarantee of the
Company’s compliance with its obligations and liabilities under several financing agreements.

According with the early repayment and cancellation of such financing contracts taken place in 2017, the
mortgage over these assets has been cancelled (see note 13).

Real estate investments refer to buildings and land allocated for exploitation under lease and/or
maintained for the purposes of obtaining a capital gain on their sale.

The income obtained as the result of rents earned from real estate investments let out under lease during
the financial year 2017, amounted to 49 thousand of euros in the year 2017 (74 thousands of euros in 2016),
while the operating costs recorded in relation to these investments were 14 thousand of euros
(19 thousands of euros in 2016).

During the financial years 2017 and 2016, the Company’s Directors assessed the potential impairment of
these assets. Their analysis revealed the need to record in the year 2017, an impairment in the amount of
504 thousand of euros, taking account of the expected sale price of these assets (1,268 thousands of euros
in 2016). This amount was entered as a charge under the heading ‘‘Impairment and results from the
disposal of fixed assets—Impairment and losses’’ in the attached profit and loss account.

In addition, during the 2017 financial year the Company has disposed of some of its real estate investments
for a total sale price of 2,732 thousand of euros (8,001 thousands of euros in 2016), generating net losses of
351 thousand of euros, which are entered under the heading ‘‘Impairment and results from the disposal of
fixed assets—Income from disposals and others’’ in the attached profit and loss account for 2017 (net
profit of 415 thousands of euros in 2016).

Similarly, to the land and constructions included under tangible fixed assets, at 31st December 2016, some
of the Company’s real estate investments were mortgaged in guarantee of the Company’s compliance with
its obligations and liabilities under several financing agreements.

According with the early repayment and cancellation of such financing contracts performed in the year
2017, the mortgage over these assets has been cancelled.

**Information on the nature and level of risk of financial instruments**

The management of the Company’s financial risk is centralised in its financial department, which has the
necessary mechanisms in place to control exposure to variations in both interest rates and exchange rates,
along with exposure to credit and liquidity risk. The following are the main financial risks that have an
impact on the Company:

**_a)_** **_Credit risk_**

The Company keeps its cash and equivalent liquid assets with recognized prestige Financial Entities. In
addition, a significant proportion of its turnover and accounts receivable from non-related clients are
guaranteed by means of credit insurance policies.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that there is no significant concentrated third-party credit risk, since
no client represents more than 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable. Individual credit limits are
established on the basis of both internal and external ratings, in accordance with the limits set by the
Company. The use of these credit limits is regularly monitored.

**_b)_** **_Liquidity risk_**

In order to ensure liquidity and be able to attend to all the payment undertakings resulting from its
business activities, the Company disposes treasury by the amount shown in the balance sheet, as well as the
financing supplied by the ultimate parent company from the group in which it is integrated. As a
consequence, the Company’s directors believe that the Company has sufficient financial resources to
engage in its normal business activities.

**_c)_** **_Market risk (including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price-related risk)_**

The Company’s cash and its financial debt are exposed to interest rate risk, which could have a significant
effect on its financial results and cash flow, in the case a significant variation of such interest rate takes
place, although this variation is not considered to be relevant by the Company’s Directors. At the same
time, the formalized debt by the Company with the ultimate group parent company, is not exposed to risks
from interest rate variations, as a fixed interest rate is accounted (see note 17).

As regards exchange rate risk, this is mainly concentrated in the sale of finished product to countries in
America and Asia, which are priced in US dollars. The Company has specific and adequate policies in
place to monitor and manage exchange rate risk in the different currencies in which it operates.

**9. Stocks**

The movements in value adjustments due to impairment entered under the heading ‘‘Stocks’’ in 2017 and

**9. Stocks (Continued)**

The Company’s policy consists on contracting insurance policies to cover any potential risk to which its
stocks may be subject. At the end of the 2016 and 2017 financial years, these insurance policies almost
entirely covered the value of the Company’s stocks.

**_Greenhouse gas emission rights_**

The balance amount shown under ‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ in the balance sheet corresponds to a
valuation of the rights purchased in previous financial years and assigned free of charge to the Company
for the 2017 financial year, pursuant to the 2013-2020 National Allocation Plan. Under this Plan, 62,508
rights were allocated to the Company for the 2017 financial year (63,714 rights allocated in 2016).

93,177 rights were used up during this financial year (85,485 rights during 2016), each corresponding to one
metric tonne of CO2, and the Company has therefore set aside a provision amounting to 546 thousand of
euros during this financial year (629 thousands of euros in 2016), entered under the heading ‘‘Other
Operating Costs—Costs due to greenhouse gas emission’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the
2017 financial year. Similarly, during 2017, the Company charged the amount of 382 thousand of euros to
‘‘Subsidies, donations and bequests received’’, entering a credit in the attached profit and loss account,
corresponding to the subsidies associated with the emission rights consumed (512 thousands of euros
during 2016).

During the 2017 and 2016 financial years the Company did not acquire any emission rights on the
secondary markets.

At the end of each financial year, the Company assesses the market value of any rights not consumed,
comparing their book value with the last available valuation, and it was not necessary to enter any value
adjustment in this regard at the end of the 2017 or 2016 financial years.

**10. Equity Value**

**Share capital**

At the end of the financial years 2017 and 2016, the share capital was represented by 880,412 shares, each
with a nominal value of 6.01 euros, all of them totally subscribed and paid up. All the shares representing
the share capital grant the same rights, and they are not admitted for trading on the Stock Market.

At the close of the 2017 financial year, the sole shareholder of the Company is Kinsan Trade, S.L. (see
note 1). At the year-end of 2016, the only companies with a holding of more than 10% in the Company’s
share capital were Tensile-Keraben Holdings S.`a.r.l, S.L., which hold a share of 77.3%, and Modernas
Iniciativas Empresariales, S.L., with a share of 22.7%.

At 31[st] December of 2016, a right of pledge over the 100% of the Company’s shares kept constituted, as a
guarantee of certain financing operations, which have been cancelled during 2017 (see note 13).

**Share issue premium**

The balance amount of the heading ‘‘Share issue premium’’, originated as the consequence of corporate
operations performed on previous years. The mercantile regulations in force, expressly allows the
utilization of the balance in amount for capital increases and does not establishes any specific restrictions
on its availability.

**Legal reserve**

Pursuant to the Spanish Capital Companies Act, limited companies must allocate an amount equal to 10%
of their profits for the year to the legal reserve, until this reserve is equal to at least 20% of the share
capital figure. The legal reserve may be used to increase the share capital using the portion of the reserve
that exceeds 10% of the increased share capital figure. Except as mentioned above, and provided that it
does not exceed 20% of the share capital figure, this reserve may only be used to offset losses, provided
that there are no other reserves available for this purpose.

**10. Equity Value (Continued)**

At the year-end of 2017 and 2016, this reserve was totally constituted, by an amount of 1,058 thousands of
euros.

**Reserve under Article 80.4 of Act 2/1995**

This reserve, included under the headline ‘‘Other reserves’’, amounting up to 28 thousand euros at the end
of the financial years 2017and 2016, correspond to a capital share reduction performed by Kanban, S.L., an
acquired company in the fiscal year 2009 (see note1).

**Dividend distribution**

Due to the fact that the account of expenses on research and development have not been totally amortized
by the year-end of 2016, it was prohibited any dividend distribution from profits, unless the amount of the
available reserves, were minimum as the same amount of the non-amortized balance. As a consequence, at
the close of the 2016 financial year, the balance shown under ‘‘Other reserves’’ was unavailable in the
amount of 99 thousand of euros. In the year 2017, the balance amount of research and development
expenses, has been totally amortized, and therefore, exists no limitation on the distribution of dividends.

On the last 5 years the Company has not distributed dividends, with the exemption to the one distributed
with charge to the issue premium in the year 2016, by an amount of 45,875 thousand of euros, which was
fully settled prior to the close of that financial year.

this debt, the Company has taken its par value, which does not differ significantly from its current net
value.

**Deposits and guarantees**

At 31 December 2017, the Company is a guarantor throughout guarantees put in place through financial
institutions by an amount of 5 thousand of euros (1,930 thousands of euros at 31[st] of December 2016).
Moreover, at the 31[st] December 2017, the Company was guaranteed by Financial Institutions by an amount
of 2,342 thousand of euros (2,816 thousands of euros at the 31[st] of December 2016). The Company’s
directors believe that any liabilities that might emerge as a result of the bonds that remained in place at the
close of the 2017 financial year, where applicable, would not be significant.

**Information on permanent differences**

Increases in the tax base due to permanent differences for the 2017 financial year correspond, mainly, with
non-recurrent expenses linked to the sale of the Company’s shares agreement and the business evolution,
which were materialized with that sale agreement described in note 1. The Managers and its tax advisors,
consider such expenses to be tax deductible, but want to confirm these criteria with the General
Directorate of Taxation, and therefore, the Company together with tis tax advisors have formally presented
a query to the General Directorate of Taxation regarding the deductibility of these expenses, which at the
date of the elaboration of the current annual accounts, have not yet been resolved.

The rest of increases correspond to i) taxes paid abroad, ii) adjustment due to loss in sale of shares,
iii) differences between accounting and fiscal amortization.

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2017 (Continued)**

**14. Government Bodies and tax situation (Continued)**

Reductions in the tax base due to permanent differences for the 2016 financial year corresponded, mainly,
to: i) the adjustment made to the tax benefit obtained by the parent Company in the sale of the companies
in which it had a holding, as detailed in note 8, at a price of 26,101 thousands of euros, and ii) the
adjustment made to the tax base due to the receipt of dividends in the amount of 5,932 thousands of euros
(see note 17). On the other hand, the increases in the taxable amount due to permanent differences of the
year 2016 corresponded, fundamentally, with taxes paid abroad, difference between accounting and fiscal
amortization, and other non-deductible expenses in Law 24/2014 of Corporate Tax.

**Information on temporary differences**

The difference between the tax burden entered for the financial year and for previous financial years and
the tax burden that has already been paid or is due to be paid for the same financial years is the result, in
the main, of time period differences originating from the financial year itself in a net amount of
3,322 thousands of euros, which mostly corresponds to: i) the increases in the tax base as a result of the
book depreciation of the trademark, in the amount of 1,401 thousands of euros, (same amount in 2016);
ii) the increase of impairment of customer’s bad debt registered during the year by an amount of
763 thousands of euros, charged to ‘‘Losses, impairment and variation of provisions of commercial
operations’’ in the profit and loss account (1,268 thousands of euros in 2016); iii) the increase in the
impairment of real estate investments entered during the financial year in the amount of 504 thousands of
euros, under the heading ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of fixed assets—Impairment and
losses’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the 2017.

At the same time, in the years 2016 and 2017, the Company has adjusted to the accounting result,
temporary differences with its origin on previous fiscal years, which correspond mainly with: i) the partial
reversal of the adjustment performed to the impairment endowment of tangible and intangible assets, due
to fiscal limitation on the deduction of such expense, introduced on Act 16 of 27th December 2012, which
implemented various tax-related measures aimed at consolidating the public finances and boosting
economic activity, and ii) to the reversal of the accelerated amortization applied on previous fiscal years.

**Reconciliation between accounting income and cost for Company Tax purposes**

Book income and costs for Company Tax purposes in the financial years 2017 and 2016 were reconciled as

The section headed ‘‘Deductions Generated’’ of the above table for the years 2017 and 2016 correspond to
the deduction due to research & development and technological innovation, deduction due to double
international taxation, donations to non-profit entities, reversal of temporary measures and employment
creation for disabled people-year 2017-.

The section headed ‘‘Other adjustments’’ in the above table of the years 2017 and 2016, corresponds,
mainly, to the difference in the book and tax valuations of the companies in which the Company had a
shareholding at the time of their sale.

**Deferred tax assets.**

The Company’s tax assets, differentiating between temporary differences, negative tax bases and
deductions pending application, can be broken down as of the end of 2017 and 2016 as follows:

The deferred tax assets referred above have been recorded in the balance sheet because the Company’s
Directors believe that, according to estimates of the Company’s future results, positive tax bases will be
obtained in sufficient amounts to ensure that these assets will be able to be recovered within the term set
out in law to this end.

**Negative tax bases pending to be offset**

In accordance with current legislation, negative tax bases from one financial year can be offset for tax
purposes against positive tax bases from subsequent financial years, and there is no limit on the number of
years in which they can be offset under the tax legislation currently in force. However, these negative tax
bases can be modified as a consequence of an inspection relating to the financial years in which they were
generated. For the financial year 2017, the implementation tax rate of 25% is maintained.

At the end of 2017, the Company retained negative tax bases pending application in the amount of
12,230 thousand of euros (18,889 thousands of euros at 31 December 2016), as broken down below.

**Deductions pending application**

Legislation related to Corporate Tax establishes various fiscal incentives with the objective of encouraging
the research and development and technological innovation, exports and training activities. At year-end
2017, the Company has deductions due to the above concepts described, pendant of usage on future
corporate tax liquidations by an amount of 2,661 thousand of euros (3,939 thousands of euros in 2016), as
well as by other concepts by an amount of 962 thousands of euros (936 thousands of euros in 2016).

According to the legislation in force, any deductions that remain pending application may be applied,
basically, within a period of fifteen and eighteen years following the financial year in which they were
generated, depending if the majority of deductions relate to research and development (18 years) or the
remaining deductions (15 years).

The increase in value from this combination of businesses that was completed during the financial year
2010 under the terms of the accounting regulations in force did not have any fiscal effects, in other words,
the increased value was not included in the tax base of the company obliged to pay tax, meaning that the
items whose value had been increased in relation to their previous value in the books of the transferring
Company were depreciated for tax purposes on the basis of this latter value. In addition, the reduced value
was not included in the tax base, and the depreciation for tax purposes of the corresponding items, which
was the same as the book depreciation, was calculated using the new base amount.

As regards to the assets and liabilities that were included in the described merger, a breakdown of the
value adjustments made as a result of the combination of businesses is shown in the following table:

In relation to other determined deductions performed by the Company on previous fiscal years, it is
important to outstand the following:

i) On the fiscal year 2009, the Company opted to apply the deduction, in the portion that was not
included in the deduction due to double imposition of capital gains from an internal source, due to

four years has been exceeded. At the end of the 2017 financial year, the Company’s operations of the last
5 years remained open for inspection in respect of Company Tax, while the last four years remained open
for inspection in respect of all other applicable taxes. Given the different potential interpretations that can
be made of the tax regulations, the results of any inspections that may be carried out by the tax authorities
in the future in relation to years that remain subject to inspection could give rise to tax liabilities, the
amount of which cannot currently be quantified in any objective way. However, the Company’s Directors
believe that the said taxes have been adequately settled, meaning that even in the event that differences
arise in respect of the interpretation of the regulations in force as regards the fiscal approach applied to
the Company’s operations, any eventual liabilities, will not have a significant effect on these annual
accounts.

fundamentally, certain non-recurrent expenses accounted expenses linked to the sale of the Company’s
shares agreement and the business evolution, which were materialized with that sale agreement, as the
consequence of the company’s restructuration process performed in the year 2017 and described in note 1.
Such expenses correspond, principally, on expenses external services from independent professional,
financial expenses related to the cancellation of the previous financing (see note 13), as well as the amount
accounted by certain incentive plans the Company took into consideration for specific Directors (see

**16. Environmental information**

The Company aims to ensure that engagement in its industrial activity is compatible with preservation of
the environment. To this end it has equipment and facilities among its tangible fixed assets that are
exclusively and specifically designed to minimise the environmental impact of its production processes and
the products that it places on the market, the net cost and net book value of which amount respectively to
5,207 thousands of euros and 3,971 thousands of euros respectively (4610 thousands of euros and
3,545 thousands of euros respectively in 2016). The provision for the depreciation of these assets amounted
to 171 thousands of euros for the 2017 financial year (213 thousands of euros in 2016).

Furthermore, in the normal course of its business activity, and as part of its environmental protection
processes, the Company incurred during the financial year 2016, costs relating to such processes amounting
to approximately 616 thousands of euros (approximately 732 thousands of euros during 2015).

The Company’s Directors do not believe that there are any risks or contingencies arising from
environmental issues that could have a significant impact on these annual accounts, reason why they do not
contain any allowance provision in this regard.

**Information on greenhouse gas emission rights**

European Parliament Directive 2003/87/EC was published in October 2003 and established undertakings
to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. European Parliament and Council Resolution 2009/29/EC of
23 April 2009 revised the rules for the period from 2013 to 2020. These Directives were enacted in Spanish

law by means of Royal Decree 1,722 of 28 December 2012, which introduced aspects relating to the
allocation of emission rights within the framework of Act 1 of 9th March 2005, which in turn regulated the
rules governing the trading of greenhouse gas emission rights. The allocation of rights to facilities eligible
to receive the free allocation of emission rights for the period from 2013 to 2020 was calculated by applying
the allocation methodology set out in European Commission Decision 2011/278/EU.

In the individual allocation of rights for the period from 2013 to 2020, the Company was awarded 62,508
tonnes free of charge for the 2017 financial year. The issue of greenhouse gases during the 2017 financial
year was estimated at 92,888 tonnes (see Notes 9 and 10) (85,485 tonnes during 2016), which meant a cost
of 544 thousand of euros which is entered under the heading ‘‘Other Operating Costs—Costs due to the
emission of greenhouse gases’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the 2017 financial year.
(629 thousands of euros in financial year 2016)

There were no future agreements on emission rights at the close of the financial year. There were no
contingencies for penalties and similar items under Act 1/2005 at the close of the financial year.

_accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Company in Spain. In the_
_event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails._

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of Keraben Grupo, S.A.,

**Report on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Keraben Grupo, S.A., which comprise the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, and the statement of profit or loss, statement of changes in equity,
statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements for the year then ended.

_Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements_

The directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying financial statements so that they present
fairly the equity, financial position and results of Keraben Grupo, S.A. in accordance with the regulatory
financial reporting framework applicable to the Company in Spain (identified in Note 2-a to the
accompanying financial statements) and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

_Auditor’s Responsibility_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Those regulations require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the equity
and financial position of Keraben Grupo, S.A. as at 31 December 2016, and its results and its cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the
Company and, in particular, with the accounting principles and rules contained therein.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The accompanying directors’ report for 2016 contains the explanations which the directors consider
appropriate about the Company’s situation, the evolution of its business and other matters, but is not an
integral part of the financial statements. We have checked that the accounting information in the directors’
report is consistent with that contained in the financial statements for 2016. Our work as auditors was
confined to checking the directors’ report with the aforementioned scope, and did not include a review of
any information other than that drawn from the Company’s accounting records.

**2. Bases for presentation (Continued)**

**_b)_** **_Faithful Image_**

These present annual accounts have been prepared from the Company’s accounts records, and they are
presented in accordance with the regulatory framework governing financial reporting that applies to the
Company, particularly the accounting principles and criteria set down in the said regulatory framework.
They thus show a faithful image of the Company’s worth, financial situation, results and cash flow
movements during the relevant financial year. In particular, preparing these annual accounts, the
Company’s Directors applied the principles governing a company that is currently trading, since in their
opinion there is no significant question regarding the continuity of its business activities. Furthermore, the
Directors have neither taken nor do they plan to take any decision that could significantly alter the value of
the asset and liability items entered in the accounts, or the time periods over which assets will be realised
and liabilities settled.

These annual accounts, which have been prepared by the Company’s Directors, shall be submitted for
approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, and it is expected that they will be approved without any
changes. Meanwhile, the annual accounts for the 2015 financial year were approved by the General
Meeting of Shareholders held on 29th April 2016 and are held on file at Castellon Mercantile Registry.

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the information contained in these annual accounts.

**_c)_** **_Accounting principles_**

The accounting principles and criteria applied during the preparation of these annual accounts are
summarised in note 4 of the accounts’ memorandum. No non-compulsory accounting principles have been
applied. In addition, the Directors have prepared these annual accounts taking account of all the
accounting principles and regulations that must be applied and that have a significant effect on the said
annual accounts. Where an accounting principle is compulsory, there is no instance in which it has not
been applied.

**_d)_** **_Responsibility for information, critical aspects relating to the valuation and assessment of uncertainty_**

While preparing these annual accounts, estimates made by the Company’s Directors have been used in
order to place a value on some of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and undertakings shown in the
accounts themselves. These estimates basically refer to the following:

- The assessment of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets (see notes 4-d, 4-f and 4-g).

- The useful life of intangible assets, tangible assets and real estate investments (see notes 4-a, 4-b and
4-c).

- The fair value of certain financial instruments (note 4-f).

- The forecast future taxable profits that make it probable that deferred tax assets will be recovered
(note15)

- The calculation of certain allowance coverage amounts (see note 4-l).

Despite the fact that these estimates have been made on the basis of the best information available at the
end of the financial year 2016, it is possible that events occurring in the future may make it necessary to
modify them (either upwards or downwards) in coming years. This will be carried out, where necessary, in
the form of a prospective analysis, and the effects of any change to the said estimates will be recognised in
the relevant future profit and loss accounts.

**_e)_** **_Comparison of information_**

The information in these annual accounts relating to the 2015 financial year is presented solely for the
purposes of comparison with the information from the 2016 financial year. In this regard, there have been
certain changes to the comparative information in the 2016 financial year as a result of the entry into force
of Royal Decree 602 of 2 December 2016, as indicated below.

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**2. Bases for presentation (Continued)**

_Royal Decree 602 of 2 December 2016_

Royal Decree 602 of 2 December 2016 was approved in December 2016. This introduced amendments to
the Spanish General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1,514 of 16 November 2007, which
became applicable from the financial year beginning on 1 January 2016.

The main amendments introduced by Royal Decree 602/2016 that affect the Company relate to the
following:

- Amendment of the rules relating to the entry and valuation of intangible assets. In line with the
amendments introduced in the Commercial Code under Act 22 of 20 July 2015, it was established that
intangible fixed assets are assets with a fixed useful life, and they must therefore be the subject of
systematic depreciation over the term that it is reasonably expected that the financial benefits inherent
in the assets in question will generate a return for the company. When the useful life of such assets
cannot be estimated in a reliable way, they will be depreciated over a maximum of ten years,
regardless of the terms set out in the individual rules regarding the intangible asset. Previously, these
intangible assets and goodwill were assets with an indefinite useful life and were not subject to
systematic depreciation, merely to impairment.

- Greenhouse gas emission rights that used to be classified under the heading ‘‘Intangible fixed assets’’
will now be entered under the heading ‘‘Stocks’’.

- More detailed information is required in the notes in respect of some items, the most important of
which are: i) the cost of the premiums paid for civil liability insurance to cover directors, and ii) the
employees with a disability of 33% or more.

As regards the amortization of fixed asset items that would previously have been classified as having an
indefinite useful life, and as permitted under the Sole Transitional Provision of Royal Decree 602/2016, the
Company has retrospectively applied the new depreciation criteria set out in the regulations to the book
value of the trademarks, opting to charge depreciation in the resulting amounts to the reserves, in
accordance with the transitional rules. Under these rules, the amortization charged to reserves has been
calculated on the basis of linear recovery criteria, on the basis of a useful life of ten years from the date of
acquisition. For assets with an acquisition date of before 1 January 2008 (the date on which the current
General Chart of Accounts was first applied), the rules were applied from this date.

According to the Second Additional Provision, if this option is chosen, comparative information must be
presented that has been adjusted to these new criteria. Thus, the amounts corresponding to the financial
year ending 31 December 2015 shown in these annual accounts have been amended from the amounts
originally shown in the annual accounts for the financial year as a consequence of the amendments
introduced by Royal Decree 602/2016. Therefore, the figures set against the reserve accounts from before
1 January 2015 have been restated. The following table contains a breakdown of the effects of applying the
new depreciation criteria for the 2015 and previous financial years.

The accumulated effect on net worth as of 1 January 2016 was as follows:

In addition, the comparative figures for the statement of changes to net worth and the cash flow statement
have been adjusted accordingly.

**_f)_** **_Grouping of entries_**

Certain entries in the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the statement of changes to net equity
value and the cash flow statement are grouped together in order to facilitate understanding, though where
information is particularly significant it is shown in broken down form in the corresponding notes to the
accounts.

**_g)_** **_Changes to accounting criteria_**

There were no significant changes to accounting criteria during 2016 in comparison with the criteria
applied during 2015, except as set out in note 2-e above.

**_h)_** **_Correction of errors_**

During the preparation of these annual accounts, no significant errors were detected that involved
re-entering the amounts included in the annual accounts for the 2015 financial year.

**3. Application of the result**

The proposal for the application of the result from the financial year 2016, which has been drawn up by the
Company’s Directors and will be submitted for approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, involves
allocating all profits for the year to the entry ‘‘Other reserves’’.

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules**

The main entry and valuation rules used by the Company when preparing its annual accounts for the
financial year 2016, pursuant to the rules set out in the Spanish General Chart of Accounts, were as
follows:

**_a)_** **_Intangible fixed assets_**

As a general rule, intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost of acquisition or production cost.
Subsequently, they are valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where
applicable, minus losses incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in note 4-d.
These assets are depreciated on the basis of their useful life.

The Company enters any loss that may have occurred in the registered value of these assets as the result of
their impairment in the accounts, using the entry headed ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of
fixed assets’’ in the profit and loss account as a contra entry. The criteria used to recognise losses due to
the impairment of these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of any losses due to impairment entered
in previous financial years are similar to those applied to tangible fixed assets, as explained in section d) of
this note.

_Research and development costs_

The Company adheres to the criterion of entering the research and development costs that it has incurred
over the course of the year in the profit and loss account. However, research and development costs
become active when the following requirements are met:

- They are specifically individually defined by project and the cost can be clearly established.

- There are justifiable reasons to trust in the technical success and financial and commercial
profitability of the project.

Any assets generated in this way are depreciated using the straight line method over the course of their
useful life (a maximum of five years). In addition, where there are doubts regarding the technical success
or economic viability of the project, the amounts entered on the assets side of the balance sheet are
attributed directly to the profit and loss account for the financial year.

_Patents, licences, trademarks and similar_

This heading includes the amounts paid to acquire patents and register the Company’s trademarks, and
items are valued initially at cost of acquisition or production cost, including registration and formal
certification costs. They are depreciated using the straight line method over 10 years.

This also includes the valuation of identifiable commercial trademarks that have emerged from the
combination of businesses during previous financial years. Trademarks are valued at their fair value on the
date of acquisition, minus the amount of the negative difference emerging from the said combination.

_IT applications_

IT applications include software acquired from third parties, and they are entered at their acquisition
price, which includes all the costs incurred until their effective entry into operation. These assets are
depreciated using the straight line method over a five-year period, from the moment that each application
enters operation.

Repair and maintenance costs incurred during the financial year are charged to the profit and loss account.
In this regard, charges in the form of maintenance services are entered as a cost in the profit and loss
account in the financial year in which they are incurred.

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_b)_** **_Tangible fixed assets_**

Tangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost of acquisition or production cost, and subsequently
valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, minus losses
incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in note 4-d.

The cost of replacing or refurbishing complete items and the cost of extending, modernising or improving
items in order to extend their useful life, productivity or economic yield are entered as a higher cost of the
tangible fixed asset in question, with the corresponding removal of the replaced or refurbished items.

Regular maintenance, conservation and repair costs are entered against the results, using the accrual
principle, as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

Any work carried out by the Company in relation to its own fixed assets is entered at the accumulated cost
that results from adding external costs to internal costs, calculated on the basis of the materials used, direct
labour costs and general manufacturing costs, based on rates of absorption similar to those applied for the
purposes of making stock valuations.

Where applicable, if a fixed asset requires a period of more than one year in order to reach operational
condition, capitalised costs will include any financial costs that have accrued prior to the item coming into
operation and have been charged by the supplier or result from loans or other forms of outside financing,
either specific or general, that are directly attributable to the acquisition or manufacture of the item in
question. The Company did not capitalise any amount in this regard during the financial years 2016 and
2015.

The Company depreciates tangible fixed assets by applying annual depreciation percentages calculated on
the basis of the estimated length of the useful life of such assets, as set out below:

**Estimated**
**Useful Life**
**Asset Type** **(years)** **Method**

Constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30–65 Straight line
Technical equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10–16 Straight line and declining balance
Other facilities, tools and furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . 3–25 Straight line
Other fixed assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3, 12–6, 25 Straight line

Useful life and amortization method are regularly reviewed in order to ensure that the method and term
used to calculate depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of profit generation relating to the
intangible fixed asset element in question, and this is adjusted prospectively in the profit and loss account.

Investments that cannot be separated from items used under leasing arrangements classified as operational
leases are entered as tangible fixed assets when they meet the requirements for definition as assets. These
investments are depreciated on the basis of their useful life, which will be the length of the lease or
assignment agreement, including any renewal term when there is evidence to support the fact that such a
renewal is going to occur, and when this is shorter than the economic life of the asset.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

**_c)_** **_Real estate investments_**

This section includes the values of land, buildings and other constructions that are maintained either for
exploitation under lease or to obtain a capital gain upon their sale, as a consequence of any increase in
their respective market prices that may apply in the future. For these assets, the Company applies the
valuation rules relating to tangible fixed assets.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_d)_** **_Value impairment of intangible fixed assets, tangible fixed assets and real estate investments_**

At the end of each financial year, whenever there are signs of a fall in value, the Company uses the
so-called impairment test to estimate the possible existence of a fall in value that may reduce the
recoverable value of such assets to an amount that is lower than their book value. The recoverable value is
calculated as either the fair value minus sale costs or the operational value, whichever is higher. In the
event that the asset does not in itself generate cash flows independently from other assets, the Company
calculates the recoverable value of the cash flow-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

During the financial years 2016 and 2015, the Company entered certain impairments in relation to some of
its real estate assets (see note 7).

**_e)_** **_Leases_**

Leases are classified as financial leases whenever it can be concluded from the terms and conditions of the
leases that the risks and benefits inherent in ownership of the asset forming the subject of the agreement
are transferred substantially to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operational leases.

_Financial leases_

In the financial leasing transactions in which the Company acts as lessee, the cost of the leased assets is
entered in the balance sheet on the basis of the nature of the item forming the subject of the agreement,
and a liability in the same amount is simultaneously entered. This amount will be the lower of either the
fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum amounts agreed at the beginning of the
lease, including any purchase option, when there is no reasonable doubt regarding the exercise of such an
option. This calculation will not include fees of a contingent nature, service costs or taxes that are
chargeable to the lessor. The total financial charge for the agreement is entered in the profit and loss
account for the financial year in which it is accrued, applying the effective interest rate method. Fees of a
contingent nature are entered as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

Assets recorded for this kind of transaction are depreciated using criteria that are similar to the ones
applied to tangible fixed assets as a whole, taking account of their nature.

_Operational leases_

Operational leases are understood to be leases under which the lessor agrees to grant the lessee the right
to use an asset over a specific period of time in return for a single payment or a series of payments or fees,
so long as this is not a lease of a financial nature.

Any costs resulting from operational lease agreements are entered in the profit and loss account in the
financial year in which they are incurred.

Any charge or payment that may be made when arranging an operational lease will be treated as an
advance charge or payment and entered against the results over the term of the lease, as the benefits from
the leased asset are assigned or received.

The amount of the minimum fees to be paid and received in relation to operational lease agreements in
which the Company is respectively named as either lessor or lessee is not significant in relation to these
annual accounts.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_f)_** **_Financial instruments_**

_Financial assets_

_Classification and initial valuation_

The financial assets owned by the Company are classified in the following categories:

a) Loans and accounts receivable: financial assets originating from the sale of goods or the provision of
services as part of the company’s normal business activities, or financial assets that, while not
originating from commercial operations, are not equity instruments or derivatives; any payments
collected are of a fixed and quantifiable amount and they are not traded on the markets.

b) Investments in the equity of group and associate companies: group companies are understood to be
those that are linked to the Company via a controlling relationship, while associated companies are
those over which the Company exercises a significant influence.

c) Guarantee bonds and deposits: these are entered in the amounts in which they were originally put in
place, which do not significantly differ from their fair value.

The financial assets included in the various categories indicated above are initially entered, in general
terms, at the fair value of the consideration handed over in payment plus any costs that can be directly
attributed to the transaction.

_Subsequent valuation_

Loans and accounts receivable are valued at their depreciated cost.

Investments in group and associated companies are valued at cost, minus, where applicable, the
accumulated value of any adjustments for impairment. These adjustments are calculated as the difference
between their book value and their recoverable value, which is understood to be either their fair value
minus sale costs, or the present value of future cash flows earned from the investment, whichever is higher.
In the absence of better evidence of the amount that may be recoverable, account is taken of the net equity
value of the subsidiary company, corrected by any unrealised capital gains that exist on the valuation date
(including goodwill, where it exists).

Financial assets available for sale are valued at their fair value, and the results of any changes to this fair
value are recorded under net equity value, until such a time as the asset is disposed of or suffers a value
impairment (of a stable or permanent nature), at which time the accumulated results previously entered
under net equity value are moved across to the profit and loss account. In this regard, an impairment (of a
permanent nature) is presumed if there has been a fall of more than 40% in the listed value of the asset, or
there has been a prolonged fall in this value over a period of one and a half years without any recovery in
its value.

The Company carries out an impairment test, at least at the end of each financial year, on any financial
assets that are not entered at their reasonable value. It is considered that there is objective evidence of
impairment if the recoverable value of the financial asset is lower than its book value. When such
impairment occurs, this is entered in the profit and loss account. In particular, as regards value adjustments
relating to commercial debtors and other accounts receivable, the rule used by the Company to calculate
the relevant value adjustments is to classify the amounts owing as doubtful debts.

_Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities are debts and accounts payable that are owed to the Company and that have originated
from the purchase of goods or services during the company’s ordinary business operations, along with any
liabilities that do not have a commercial origin and cannot be regarded as derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Company classified all of its short-term financial liabilities as debts
and accounts payable.

F-218


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

Debts and accounts payable are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration received, adjusted to
take account of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are valued according
to their depreciated cost.

The Company removes financial liabilities when the obligations that gave rise to them disappear.

**_g)_** **_Stocks_**

Stocks are valued at their acquisition price, production price or net realizable value, whichever is the
lowest. Commercial discounts, lower prices obtained, other similar amounts and the interest included in
the base amount of debited items are deducted when calculating the acquisition price. Discounts for
prompt payment are also included as a lower purchase price, whether shown in the invoice or not.

The production cost includes direct material costs and, where applicable, direct labour costs and general
manufacturing costs.

The net realizable value represents an estimate of the sale price minus all the costs that are estimated in
order to complete manufacture, plus any costs that will be incurred during the course of the marketing,
sales and distribution processes.

When allocating value to its inventories, the Company uses the FIFO method.

The Company makes the appropriate value adjustments, entering them as a cost in the profit and loss
account, when the net realisable value of stocks is lower than their cost of acquisition (or production cost).

**_h)_** **_Subsidies, donations and bequests received_**

When accounting subsidies, donations and bequests received, the Company applies the following rules:

a) Non-repayable subsidies, donations and bequests: These are valued at the fair value of the amount
granted or item received, depending on whether or not it is in monetary form, and they are entered in
the results in proportion to the amount allocated to depreciation of the item benefiting from the
subsidy over the period or, where applicable, when it is disposed of or a value adjustment is made for
its impairment, with the exception of amounts received from members or owners, which are entered
directly as shareholder equity and do not constitute any kind of income.

b) Repayable subsidies: While they remain repayable, they are entered as liabilities.

c) Operating subsidies: These are entered in the results at the time at which they are awarded, unless
they are used to finance operational deficits in future years, in which case they are entered in the
relevant financial year. If they are awarded in order to finance specific costs, they are entered as the
costs being financed accrue.

**_i)_** **_Transactions in foreign currency_**

The operational currency used by the Company is the euro. Consequently, all transactions in currencies
other than the euro are regarded as being denominated in foreign currency and entered according to the
rates of exchange that apply on the transaction date.

At the end of the financial year, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are
converted at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet. Any profit or loss that emerges is
entered directly in the profit and loss account for the financial year in which it occurs.

**_j)_** **_Tax on profits_**

The cost or income from tax on profits comprises the part that relates to the cost or income from current
tax and the part that corresponds to the cost or income due to deferred tax.

Current tax is the amount that the Company pays as a consequence of the tax payable on the income it has
earned during the financial year. Any deductions or other tax advantages that apply to the tax amount,

F-219


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

excluding withheld taxes and payments on account, plus any tax losses that can be offset from previous
financial years and that can be applied during the current year, lead to a decrease in the current tax
amount.

The cost or income from deferred tax corresponds to the recognition and cancellation of assets and
liabilities resulting from deferred taxes. These include the time-period differences identified as amounts
that are expected to be payable or recoverable due to the difference between the asset and liability
amounts shown in the books and their taxable value, together with any negative tax bases that are pending
offset and credits due as the result of deductions against tax that are not fiscally applied. These amounts
are entered by applying the time-period difference or corresponding credit to the tax rate at which they are
expected to be recovered or paid.

All time-period differences are entered as deferred tax liabilities, except for those that originate from the
initial entry of goodwill or other assets and liabilities in operations that do not affect either the tax result or
the book result and do not constitute a combination of businesses.

Meanwhile, deferred tax assets are only entered to the extent that it is considered probable that the
Company will earn sufficient tax profits in the future for them to be offset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from operations that lead to direct charges or payments being
entered as asset entries are also accounted for with a contra entry in net equity value.

Upon closing each set of accounts, the deferred tax assets recorded are reappraised and the relevant
adjustments are made in the event that there are any doubts regarding their future recovery. Any deferred
tax assets not recorded in the balance sheet are also appraised at the close of each year, and these are
entered in the accounts whenever it becomes probable that they could be recovered against future taxable
profits.

**_k)_** **_Income and expenses_**

Income and expenses are entered on the basis of accrual criteria, i.e. at the time of the actual flow of goods
and services that they represent, regardless of the time at which the monetary or financial flow resulting
from such goods and services occurs. Income is valued at the fair value of the payment received minus
discounts and taxes.

Income from sales is entered at the moment that all significant risk and benefit inherent in ownership of
the item being sold is transferred to the purchaser, and neither current management of that item nor
effective control there over are subsequently maintained.

As regards income from the provision of services, this is recognised on the basis of the degree to which
such services have been completed on the date of the balance sheet, provided that the results of the
transaction can be reliably estimated.

Interests received from financial assets are entered on the basis of the effective interest rate method, while
dividends are entered when the shareholders’ right to receive them is announced. In any case, any interest
or dividends accruing on financial assets subsequent to their acquisition are entered as income in the profit
and loss account.

**_l)_** **_Provisions and contingencies_**

When preparing these annual accounts, the Company’s Directors have differentiated between the
following:

- Provisions: liabilities covering obligations that remained outstanding on the date of the balance sheet
as a consequence of past events that are likely to emerge and could result in damage to the Company’s
assets of an unknown value and over an unknown time. These amounts are entered on the balance
sheet in the form of allowance provisions in the current most probable value that the Company
estimates it would have to pay in order to be released from the obligation, and

F-220


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

- Contingent liabilities: potential obligations arising as a consequence of past events, the emergence of
which is conditional upon whether or not one or more future events arise that are beyond the control
of the Company.

These annual accounts record all the significant provisions in respect of which it is estimated that there is a
probability that the obligation will need to be covered. Contingent liabilities are not entered in the annual
accounts, though information on such liabilities is given insofar as they are not classified as remote.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the best possible estimate of the amount that will be required
to cancel or transfer the obligation, bearing in mind all available information relating to the event and its
consequences, and any adjustments arising as a result of the updating of such provisions are entered as a
financial cost as they accrue.

Any compensation to be received from a third party at the time at which the obligation is settled, provided
that there is no doubt that such compensation will be received, is entered as an asset, except in the event
there is a legal connection through which part of the risk has been outsourced, under which the Company
will not be obliged to assume liability; in this situation, the compensation will be taken into account when
estimating the amount that is to be recorded, where applicable, for the provision in question.

**_m)_** **_Asset items of an environmental nature_**

Asset items of an environmental nature are understood to be lasting assets that are used during the course
of the Company’s activities for the main purpose of minimising environmental impact, protecting and
improving the environment, including the reduction or elimination of future contamination.

The tangible fixed asset items designed to minimise any environmental impact that could result from the
activities engaged in by the Company are valued at cost price, adjusted by their accumulated depreciation.

Any extension, modernisation and improvement costs are capitalised when they represent an extension of
the estimated useful life of the assets in question. Otherwise they are treated as costs for that financial
year, along with repair and maintenance costs.

Any costs that are incurred in relation to the protection and improvement of the environment and that do
not represent an investment in tangible fixed assets are entered in the results for the year in which they are
incurred, regardless of the time at which the cash or financial stream resulting from such costs materialises.

Amounts incurred in the management of environmental effects resulting from the business activities
engaged in by the company are classified as environmental costs, as are the costs that result from the
Company’s existing environmental undertakings. These include the costs incurred as a result of preventing
pollution in relation to the Company’s current operational activities, the treatment of residue and waste,
decontamination, restoration, environmental management and environmental auditing.

The Company follows the rule of accounting for any potential undertakings at the moment at which it
becomes aware of them.

Allowance provision for probable or certain environment-related liabilities, on-going lawsuits and pending
compensation and obligations of an undetermined amount, where not covered by the insurance policies
that have been taken out, is set aside at the moment that the liability or obligation that will result in
compensation or payment arises.

**_n)_** **_Greenhouse gas emission rights_**

As note 2-e) indicates, from the 1[st] January 2016 onwards, greenhouse gas emission rights, which are used
for the cancellation of the obligation derived from the emissions developed by the company, are
reclassified as stocks. In the same way, emission rights hold to be sold were registered.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of a right is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

F-221


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ are entered in the balance sheet when the company becomes eligible for
such rights. When such rights are acquired free of charge or at a price that is substantially lower than their
market value, the acquisition price is considered to be their market price at the time of acquisition or at the
beginning of the calendar year. In this case, they will be entered with a contra entry under ‘‘Subsidies,
donations and bequests received’’ in the Net Equity Value section of the balance sheet, once any deferred
tax associated with them has been deducted.

After being entered as an asset, emission rights are valued at their acquisition price or production price
under stocks. The necessary provisions are set aside in order to give them their lower market value at the
end of each financial year, whenever their book value may not be recoverable from the generation of
sufficient income to cover all costs and expenses.

Costs attached to the emission of greenhouse gases require the corresponding provision to be made for
risks and costs, and this provision is maintained until the moment that the Company has to cancel the
obligation in question by handing over the corresponding emission rights.

Costs accrue as greenhouse gases are emitted, and they are entered under ‘‘Other operating costs-Costs
from emission of greenhouse effect gasses’’ in the attached profit and loss accounts for 2016 and 2015,
calculated according to the emission rights that have been transferred.

Subsidies of a non-repayable nature associated with emission rights acquired free of charge or at a price
that is substantially below their market price are entered as ‘‘Subsidies, donations and bequests received’’
and charged to the profit and loss account in the same proportion as the costs incurred from the gas
emissions relating to the subsidised emission rights.

**_o)_** **_Related party transactions_**

The Company carries out all related party transactions at market prices. In addition, its transfer pricing
policy is properly supported on the basis of the requirements set out in current tax legislation, and the
Company’s Directors therefore believe that there are no significant risks in this regard that could give rise
to liabilities worthy of consideration in the future.

**_p)_** **_Current and non-current entries_**

Current assets are understood to be assets that are linked to the normal business cycle, which is generally
regarded a one-year period, and the term is also understood to apply to assets that are due to maturity or
be disposed of or realised in the short term following the end of the financial year, financial assets
maintained for negotiation and cash and other equivalent liquid assets. Assets that do not meet these
requirements are classified as non-current.

Similarly, current liabilities are liabilities that are linked to the normal business cycle, financial liabilities
maintained for negotiation (excluding financial derivatives with a settlement term of more than one year)
and, in general, all obligations that are due to mature or be cancelled in the short-term. Otherwise they are
classified as non-current.

**Patents, licences, trademarks and similar**

As indicated in Notes 4-a and 5, the amount of 14,008 thousands of euros has been entered under
‘‘trademarks’’ in the section headed ‘‘Patents, licences, trademarks and similar’’, as the result of a valuation
made by the Company’s directors during the 2010 financial year in the context of the amalgamation of
businesses that occurred in that year.

The Company’s directors cannot reliably estimate a foreseeable limit to the period during which this
trademark can be expected to generate net cash revenues for the Company, and the trademark will
therefore be amortized, pursuant to the applicable accounting regulations, over a ten-year period. In the
event that there are signs of any impairment, an ‘‘impairment’’ test will be applied, in accordance with the
methodology described in note 2-d. In this regard, as detailed in note 2-e, the directors have opted for the
retroactive application of the depreciation of this asset, and the comparative figures relating to
accumulated depreciation have therefore been restated.

**6. Tangible Fixed Assets**

The movement that occurred during the financial years 2016 and 2015 under the heading ‘‘Tangible fixed

All tangible fixed assets are for the company’s own use, and at the close of the financial years 2016 and
2015, no item had been assigned to third parties under a leasing arrangement.

**Information relating to additions**

The majority of the additions in 2016, as shown in the above table, along with the balance shown under the
heading ‘‘Advances and fixed assets under construction’’, correspond to improvements to the Company’s
production facilities, which are scheduled to be completed over the coming year, as part of the investment
plan approved by the Company. At 31st December 2016 there were no firm undertakings to purchase
acquired tangible fixed assets (1,931 thousands of euros entered in this regard at the end of the 2015
financial year).

At close of the 2016 and 2015 financial years, tangible fixed assets did not include any assets acquired from
other group companies in any significant amount.

**Information relating to removals**

The items removed during 2016, as shown in the foregoing table, correspond to some items that have been
sold during the financial period by a total amount of 13 thousands of euros, and others that have been
deregistered. The net result of these deregistration has ascended to an amount of 12 thousands of euros
(profit), which is entered under the heading ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of fixed assets’’ on
the attached profit and loss account for the financial year 2016.

**Other information**

As of 31st December 2016 and 2015, the Company had fixed asset items that had been fully depreciated as

**6. Tangible Fixed Assets (Continued)**

It is the Company’s policy to take out the insurance policies necessary to cover any potential risk to which
its fixed asset items may be exposed. At the end of the 2016 and 2015 financial years, the net book value of
its fixed assets was completely covered by these policies.

At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Company’s land and constructions were mortgaged in guarantee of the
Company’s compliance with its obligations and liabilities under several financing agreements (see note 14).

As note 8 describes, at year end of 2016 and 2015, the company had contracts on diverse financial leasing
operations on plant and equipment

Real estate investments refer to buildings and land allocated for exploitation under lease and/or
maintained for the purposes of obtaining a capital gain on their sale.

The income obtained as the result of rents earned from real estate investments let out under lease during
the financial year 2016, entered in the profit and loss account for the year, amounted to 74 thousands of

euros (360 thousands of euros in 2015), while the operating costs recorded in relation to these investments
were 19 thousands of euros (150 thousands of euros in 2015).

As indicated in note 8, at the end of the financial years 2016 and 2015, the Company had entered into
specific financial and operational leasing transactions in relation to its real estate investments.

During the 2016 financial year, the Company’s directors assessed the potential impairment of these assets.
Their analysis revealed the need to record an impairment in the amount of 1,268 thousands of euros,
taking account of the expected sale price of these assets. This amount was entered as a charge under the
heading ‘‘Impairment and results from the disposal of fixed assets—Impairment and losses’’ in the
attached profit and loss account for 2016, though the asset in question was disposed of prior to the end of
the 2016 financial year.

In addition, during the 2016 financial year the Company sold some of its real estate investments for a total
sale price of 8,001 thousands of euros, generating net profits of 415 thousands of euros, which are entered
under the heading ‘‘Impairment and results from the disposal of fixed assets—Income from disposals and
others’’ in the attached profit and loss account for 2016.

Similarly to the land and constructions included under tangible fixed assets, at 31st December 2016 and
2015, some of the Company’s real estate investments were mortgaged in guarantee of the Company’s
compliance with its obligations and liabilities under several financing agreements (see note 14).

**Information on the nature and level of risk of financial instruments**

The management of the Company’s financial risk is centralised in its financial department, which has the
necessary mechanisms in place to control exposure to variations in both interest rates and exchange rates,
along with exposure to credit and liquidity risk. The following are the main financial risks that have an
impact on the Company:

**_a)_** **_Credit risk_**

In general, the Company keeps its cash and equivalent liquid assets with financial institutions with a high
credit rating. In addition, a significant proportion of its turnover and accounts receivable from non-related
clients are guaranteed by means of credit insurance policies.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that there is no significant concentrated third-party credit risk, since
no client represents more than 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable. Individual credit limits are
established on the basis of both internal and external ratings, in accordance with the limits set by the
Company. The use of these credit limits is regularly monitored.

**9. Financial investments (Continued)**

**_b)_** **_Liquidity risk_**

In order to ensure liquidity and attend to all the payment undertakings resulting from its business
activities, the Company maintains a level of financial debt that is appropriate to its cash generation, and it
also has additional operational financing lines that have not been drawn on, as detailed in note 14. In
addition, as explained in note 20, during the month of March 2017 the Company reached an agreement
with financial entities which allowed it to carry out a novation of the entire debt that it held with them, and
as part of this process certain guarantees that had previously been granted to the financing institutions
were released. As a consequence, the Company’s directors believe that the Company has sufficient
financial resources to engage in its normal business activities.

**_c)_** **_Market risk (including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price-related risk)_**

Both the Company’s cash and its financial debts are exposed to interest rate risk, which could have a
significant effect on its financial results and cash flow. However, some of the Company’s borrowings were
arranged at a fixed interest rate (see note 14).

As regards exchange rate risk, this is mainly concentrated in the sale of finished product to countries in
America and Asia, which are priced in US dollars. The Company has specific and adequate policies in
place to monitor and manage exchange rate risk in the different currencies in which it operates.

**10. Stocks**

The movements in value adjustments due to impairment entered under the heading ‘‘Stocks’’ in 2016 and
2015 were as follows:

These value adjustments were caused, in the main, by the renewal of the product catalogue.

At 31st December 2016 and 2015 there were no stocks of significant value deposited in the custody of third
parties. The Company also did not maintain undertakings to purchase stocks in a significant amount at the
end of the financial year 2015.

The Company’s policy consists on contracting insurance policies to cover any potential risk to which its
stocks may be subject. At the end of the 2016 and 2017 financial years, these insurance policies almost
entirely covered the value of the Company’s stocks.

**_Greenhouse gas emission rights_**

As described in note 2-e, during the 2016 financial year the amount shown under ‘‘Greenhouse gas
emission rights’’ was reclassified under the heading ‘‘Stocks’’. This balance corresponds to a valuation of
the rights purchased in previous financial years and assigned free of charge to the Company for the 2016
financial year, pursuant to the 2013-2020 National Allocation Plan. Under this Plan, 63,714 rights were
allocated to the Company for the 2016 financial year (64,909 rights allocated in 2015).

85,485 rights were used up during this financial year (79,827 rights during 2015), each corresponding to one
metric tonne of CO2, and the Company has therefore set aside a provision amounting to 629,000 euros
during this financial year (528,000 euros in 2015), entered under the heading ‘‘Other Operating Costs—
Costs due to greenhouse gas emission’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the 2016 financial year.
Similarly, during 2016, the Company charged the amount of 512,000 euros to ‘‘Subsidies, donations and

bequests received’’, entering a credit in the attached profit and loss account, corresponding to the subsidies
associated with the emission rights consumed (496,000 euros during 2015).

During the 2016 and 2015 financial years the Company did not acquire any emission rights on the
secondary markets.

At the end of each financial year, the Company assesses the market value of any rights not consumed,
comparing their book value with the last available valuation, and it was not necessary to enter any value
adjustment in this regard at the end of the 2016 or 2015 financial years.

**11. Equity Value**

**Share capital**

At the end of the financial years 2016 and 2015, the share capital was represented by 880,412 shares, each
with a nominal value of 6.01 euros, all of them totally subscribed and paid up. All the shares representing
the share capital grant the same rights, and they are not admitted for trading on the Stock Market. In order
to guarantee the financing operations described in note 14, an _in rem pledge right has been established_
over 100% of the Company’s shares.

At the close of the 2016 financial year, the only companies with a holding of more than 10% in the
Company’s share capital were Tensile-Keraben Holdings S.`a.r.l, S.L., which holds a share of 77.3% in the
Company’s share capital, and Modernas Iniciativas Empresariales, S.L., with a share of 22.7%.

**Legal reserve**

Pursuant to the Spanish Capital Companies Act, limited companies must allocate an amount equal to 10%
of their profits for the year to the legal reserve, until this reserve is equal to at least 20% of the share
capital figure. The legal reserve may be used to increase the share capital using the portion of the reserve
that exceeds 10% of the increased share capital figure. Except as mentioned above, and provided that it
does not exceed 20% of the share capital figure, this reserve may only be used to offset losses, provided
that there are no other reserves available for this purpose. At the end of the financial years 2016 and 2015,
this reserve was fully constituted.

**Reserve under Article 80.4 of Act 2/1995**

This reserve, included under the headline ‘‘Other reserves’’, amounting up to 28 thousand euros at the end
of the financial years 2016 and 2015, correspond to a capital share reduction performed by Kanban, S.L.,
an acquired company in the fiscal year 2009 (see note1).

**Dividend distribution**

The distribution of any profits is prohibited until research and development costs have been completely
amortized, unless the amount of available reserves is at least equal to the amount of these costs that has
not been amortized. As a consequence, at the close of the 2016 financial, the balance shown under ‘‘Other
reserves’’ was unavailable in the amount of 99,000 euros (349,000 euros at the close of the 2015 financial
year).

in 2015).

The other subsidies were mainly granted for the purposes of financing the completion of research and/or
development projects and the acquisition of tangible fixed assets

At the end of the financial years 2016 and 2015, the company had complied with all the requests necessary
in order to receive and benefit from the subsidies mentioned above.

The balance entered under ‘‘Other provisions’’ for the 2015 financial year in the foregoing table
corresponds to guarantees put in place with financial institutions in favour of various companies and other
provisions against contingencies from previous financial years. During the 2016 financial year, the
obligations that had given rise to the setting aside of these provisions were settled, and the Company has
therefore reversed these amounts.

The balance entered under ‘‘Bank loans’’ corresponds almost entirely to a syndicated loan granted to the
Company in previous financial years, the final maturity date of which has been set for the year 2021. The
main details of this financing at the 31[st] December 2016 are as follows:

- Senior tranche: syndicated loan granted by an initial amount of 68.1 million euros.

- Asset tranche: syndicated loan granted by an amount of 12 million euros.

- The Company can repay the principal in advance, either wholly or in part, without incurring penalties
of any kind.

- The interest rate is tied to the Euribor, plus a market differential in the case of the senior tranche, and
a fixed interest rate that will vary between 1% and 3% for the asset tranche, based on a
pre-established timetable.

- Compliance with certain financial conditions during the term of the financing, In this regard, at the
end of the financial years 2016 and 2015, the Company was in compliance with all the financial and
other conditions required under the various financing agreements that remained in force.

In order to ensure compliance with the obligations assumed under the syndicated loan and operational
financing facilities described above, at the 31[st] December 2016 there were a number of guarantees in

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**14. Long- and short-term debts (Continued)**

favour of credit entities that have been put in place, among which we would make particular mention of
the following:

- ‘‘Senior Tranche’’, first-rank real estate mortgage over various properties (the net book value of which
at the close of the financial year 2016 amounted to 66,543 thousands of euros): a first-rank asset
mortgage established over the ‘‘Keraben’’ trademark, pledge over all the shares in Keraben
Grupo, S.A.

- ‘‘Asset Tranche’’: first-rank real estate mortgage over various real estate assets (see note 7), whose net
book value at the close of the financial year 2016 amounted to 4,312 thousands of euros.

- In addition, there are certain obligations relating to a compulsory early repayment of the senior
tranche, by way of a cash sweep, depending on compliance with certain financial ratios which its
compliance were not achieved at the year-end of 2016.

- There is also a restriction on the distribution of dividends while all of the financing operations
described above remain pending cancellation, though the Company has obtained express
authorisation from the financing institutions to make the dividend distribution mentioned in note 11.

As detailed in note 20, following the closure of the financial year, the Company reached an agreement with
the financing institutions allowing it to modify the conditions of the said financing, and practically all of the
guarantees described above have been released.

The amounts shown in the entry under the heading ‘‘Financial lease creditors’’, recording short-term
liabilities in the attached balance sheet at 31st December 2016, correspond to the amounts pending
payment under the financial leasing agreements maintained by the Company, as described in note 8.

The amount entered under ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ in the current and non-current liabilities section of
the attached balance sheet corresponds to loans granted by various Public Entities, and other debts
maintained with asset suppliers. These loans do not accrue any kind of interest, and the implicit interest is
not significant. In order to calculate the fair value of this debt, the Company has taken its par value, which
does not differ significantly from its current net value.

**Deposits and guarantees**

At 31 December 2016, the guarantees put in place by the Company through financial institutions
amounted to 1,930 thousands of euros (2,793 thousands of euros during the 2015 financial year), and these
mainly referred to technical bonds provided as guarantees for debts in favour of a Reciprocal Guarantee
Company. One part of the bonds from 2015 covered the obligations described in note 13, and these were
released during the 2016 financial year since the obligations assumed by the Company were cancelled. The
Company’s directors believe that any liabilities that might emerge as a result of the bonds that remained in
place at the close of the 2016 financial year, where applicable, would not be significant.

**Cash and other equivalent liquid assets.**

At 31st December 2016 and 2015, the amount shown under ‘‘Cash and other equivalent liquid assets’’
related almost entirely to the cash amounts available in the current accounts held by the Company at
various reputable financial institutions.

**15. Government Bodies and tax situation**

**Reconciliation between accounting income and taxable income**

Company Tax is calculated on the basis of financial or accounting income, which is obtained in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and which does not necessarily have to coincide with taxable
income, this being understood to mean the tax base.

**Information on permanent differences**

Increases in the tax base due to permanent differences for the 2016 financial year correspond, in the main,
to taxes paid abroad, differences between book depreciation and tax depreciation, and expenses that are
classified as non-deductible under Spanish Company Tax Act 27/2014.

Reductions in the tax base due to permanent differences for the 2016 financial year correspond, in the
main, to: i) the adjustment made to the tax benefit obtained by the parent Company in the sale of the
companies in which it had a holding, as detailed in note 9, at a price of 26,101 thousands of euros, and
ii) the adjustment made to the tax base due to the receipt of dividends in the amount of 5,932 thousands of
euros (see note 18).

**Information on temporary differences**

The difference between the tax burden entered for the financial year and for previous financial years and
the tax burden that has already been paid or is due to be paid for the same financial years is the result, in

F-237

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31st December 2016 (Continued)**

**15. Government Bodies and tax situation (Continued)**

the main, of time period differences originating from the financial year itself in a net amount of
875 thousands of euros, which mostly corresponds to: i) the increases in the tax base as a result of the book
depreciation of the trademark, in the amount of 1,401 thousands of euros; ii) the increase in the
impairment of real estate investments entered during the financial year in the amount of 1,268 thousands
of euros, under the heading ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of fixed assets—Impairment and
losses’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the 2016 financial year; iii) the difference in the book
and tax valuation of the companies in which the Company held a share when these companies were sold
during the 2016 financial year, due to the impairments regarded as non-deductible at the time of their
entry in the accounts.

At the same time, the Company has adjusted to the accounting result, temporary differences with its origin
on previous fiscal years, which correspond mainly with: i) the partial reversal of the adjustment performed
to the impairment endowment of tangible and intangible assets, due to fiscal limitation on the deduction of
such expense, introduced on Act 16 of 27th December 2012, which implemented various tax-related
measures aimed at consolidating the public finances and boosting economic activity, and ii) to the reversal
of the accelerated amortization applied on previous fiscal years.

**Reconciliation between accounting income and cost for Company Tax purposes**

**Total costs/(income) for tax purposes entered in the profit and loss account . . . . . . . .** **4,277** **1,049**

The section headed ‘‘Other adjustments’’ in the above table corresponds, in the main, to the difference in
the book and tax valuations of the companies in which the Company had a shareholding at the time of
their sale.

The legislation in relation to Company Tax establishes a range of tax incentives with the aim of
encouraging research and development and technological innovation, exports and training activities. At the
end of the financial year 2016, the Company had made deductions in this regard, pending application
against future Company Tax payments, in the amount of 3,976 thousand euros (4,337 thousand euros in
2015), along with deductions relating to other items in the amount of 936 thousand euros (1,313 thousand
euros in 2014).

**Deferred tax assets.**

The Company’s tax assets, differentiating between temporary differences, negative tax bases and
deductions pending application, can be broken down as of the end of 2016 and 2015 as follows:

The deferred tax assets referred above have been recorded in the balance sheet because the Company’s
Directors believe that, according to estimates of the Company’s future results, positive tax bases will be
obtained in sufficient amounts to ensure that these assets will be able to be recovered within the term set
out in law to this end.

**Negative tax bases pending to be offset**

In accordance with current legislation, negative tax bases from one financial year can be offset for tax
purposes against positive tax bases from subsequent financial years, and there is no limit on the number of
years in which they can be offset under the tax legislation currently in force. However, these negative tax

The increase in value from this combination of businesses that was completed during the financial year
2010 under the terms of the accounting regulations in force did not have any fiscal effects, in other words,
the increased value was not included in the tax base of the company obliged to pay tax, meaning that the
items whose value had been increased in relation to their previous value in the books of the transferring
Company were depreciated for tax purposes on the basis of this latter value. In addition, the reduced value
was not included in the tax base, and the depreciation for tax purposes of the corresponding items, which
was the same as the book depreciation, was calculated using the new base amount.

As regards to the assets and liabilities that were included in the described merger, a breakdown of the
value adjustments made as a result of the combination of businesses is shown in the following table:

In relation to other determined deductions performed by the Company on previous fiscal years, it is
important to outstand the following:

i) On the fiscal year 2009, the Company opted to apply the deduction, in the portion that was not
included in the deduction due to double imposition of capital gains from an internal source, due to

The income to be included during the tax periods between 2017 and 2038 inclusive will be included at a
rate of 64 thousand euros per year.

**Financial years pending verification and inspection processes**

Pursuant to the legislation currently in force, taxes may not be regarded as having been completely settled
until the tax returns submitted have been inspected by the tax authorities, or until the time-bar period has

been exceeded. At the end of the 2016 financial year, the periods 2012 to 2016 of the Company’s operation
remained open for inspection in respect of Company Tax, while the last four years remained open for
inspection in respect of all other applicable taxes. Given the different potential interpretations that can be
made of the tax regulations, the results of any inspections that may be carried out by the tax authorities in
the future in relation to years that remain subject to inspection could give rise to tax liabilities, the amount
of which cannot currently be quantified in any objective way. However, the Company’s Directors believe
that the said taxes have been adequately settled, meaning that even in the event that differences arise in
respect of the interpretation of the regulations in force as regards the fiscal approach applied to the
Company’s operations, any eventual liabilities, will not have a significant effect on these annual accounts.

In addition, on 4th July 2014, the Tax Authorities began an inspection relating to Company Tax for the
financial years 2010 to 2011, and an inspection of Value Added Tax and amounts retained or paid in on
account against revenues and professional services, capital assets and real estate leases for the period
between 2010 and 2011 by the Company. The inspection was extended to the period between 2012 and
2014 with regard to company tax. These inspections were completed during the 2016 financial year, though
they did not generate any impact that had not already been entered by the closure of the 2015 financial
year.

**17. Environmental information**

The Company aims to ensure that engagement in its industrial activity is compatible with preservation of
the environment. To this end it has equipment and facilities among its tangible fixed assets that are
exclusively and specifically designed to minimise the environmental impact of its production processes and
the products that it places on the market, the net cost and net book value of which amount respectively to
4,610 thousands of euros and 3,545 thousands of euros respectively (3,878 thousands of euros and
3,027 thousands of euros respectively in 2015). The provision for the depreciation of these assets amounted
to 213 thousands of euros for the 2016 financial year (199 thousands of euros in 2015).

Furthermore, in the normal course of its business activity, and as part of its environmental protection
processes, the Company incurred during the financial year 2016, costs relating to such processes amounting
to approximately 616 thousands of euros (approximately 732 thousands of euros during 2015).

The Company’s Directors do not believe that there are any risks or contingencies arising from
environmental issues that could have a significant impact on these annual accounts, and for that reason
these annual accounts do not contain any allowance provision in this regard.

**Information on greenhouse gas emission rights**

European Parliament Directive 2003/87/EC was published in October 2003 and established undertakings
to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. European Parliament and Council Resolution 2009/29/EC of
23 April 2009 revised the rules for the period from 2013 to 2020. These Directives were enacted in Spanish
law by means of Royal Decree 1,722 of 28 December 2012, which introduced aspects relating to the
allocation of emission rights within the framework of Act 1 of 9th March 2005, which in turn regulated the
rules governing the trading of greenhouse gas emission rights. The allocation of rights to facilities eligible
to receive the free allocation of emission rights for the period from 2013 to 2020 was calculated by applying
the allocation methodology set out in European Commission Decision 2011/278/EU.

In the individual allocation of rights for the period from 2013 to 2020, the Company was awarded
63,714 tonnes free of charge for the 2016 financial year. The issue of greenhouse gases during the 2016
financial year was estimated at 85,485 tonnes (see Notes 10 and 11) (79,827 tonnes during 2015), which
meant a cost of 629 thousands of euros which is entered under the heading ‘‘Other Operating Costs—
Costs due to the emission of greenhouse gases’’ in the attached profit and loss account for the 2016
financial year.

shares. The operation was performed under the tax rules set out in Royal Legislative Decree 4/2004, which
approved the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Company Tax Act. Specifically, the planned non-monetary
transaction, governed by Article 94 of the aforementioned Royal Legislative Decree, was carried out under
the tax rules set out in Chapter VIII of Title VII.

**20. Events occurring after closure of the accounts**

Following the closure of the financial year, the Company formalised an agreement to renew the conditions
of the financing detailed in note 14, in such a way that the new conditions are, essentially, as follows:

- Syndicated loan in the amount of 70 million euros in a single tranche.

- Repayment period of 7 years.

- Interest rate based on the Euribor rate plus a market differential, which will vary depending on the
performance of certain financial ratios of the Company.

- Restrictions on the distribution of dividends and additional borrowing by the Company have been
removed, provided that certain financial ratios remain below specific established limits.

- As regards the guarantees that were put in place during the earlier financing and remained in place
during the 2016 financial year, the guarantees and mortgages over the Company’s tangible and real
estate assets have been released and have been replaced by a mortgage undertaking over these same
assets.

_accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Company in Spain. In the_
_event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails._

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of Keraben Grupo, S.A.,

**Report on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Keraben Grupo, S.A., which comprise the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2015, and the statement of profit or loss, statement of changes in equity,
statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements for the year then ended.

_Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements_

The directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying financial statements so that they present
fairly the equity, financial position and results of Keraben Grupo, S.A. in accordance with the regulatory
financial reporting framework applicable to the Company in Spain (identified in Note 2-a to the
accompanying financial statements) and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

_Auditor’s Responsibility_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Those regulations require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the equity
and financial position of Keraben Grupo, S.A. as at 31 December 2015, and its results and its cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the
Company and, in particular, with the accounting principles and rules contained therein.

_Other Matters_

The Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were audited by another
auditor, who expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements on 5 May 2015.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The accompanying directors’ report for 2015 contains the explanations which the directors consider
appropriate about the Company’s situation, the evolution of its business and other matters, but is not an
integral part of the financial statements. We have checked that the accounting information in the directors’
report is consistent with that contained in the financial statements for 2015. Our work as auditors was
confined to checking the directors’ report with the aforementioned scope, and did not include a review of
any information other than that drawn from the Company’s accounting records.

the said decision was publicly recorded. The operation was also registered with the Mercantile Registry on
19th January 2015.

**2. Bases for presentation (Continued)**

**_b)_** **_Faithful Image_**

These present annual accounts have been prepared from the Company’s accounts records, and they are
presented in accordance with the regulatory framework governing financial reporting that applies to the
Company, particularly the accounting principles and criteria set down in the said regulatory framework.
They thus show a faithful image of the Company’s worth, financial situation, results and cash flow
movements during the relevant financial year. In particular, preparing these annual accounts, the
Company’s Directors applied the principles governing a company that is currently trading, since in their
opinion there is no significant question regarding the continuity of its business activities. Furthermore, the
Directors have neither taken nor do they plan to take any decision that could significantly alter the value of
the asset and liability items entered in the accounts, or the time periods over which assets will be realised
and liabilities settled.

These annual accounts, which have been prepared by the Company’s Directors, shall be submitted for
approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, and it is expected that they will be approved without any
changes. Meanwhile, the annual accounts for the 2014 financial year were approved by the General
Meeting of Shareholders held on 15th June 2015 and are held on file at Castellon Mercantile Registry.

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the information contained in these annual accounts.

**_c)_** **_Accounting principles_**

The accounting principles and criteria applied during the preparation of these annual accounts are
summarised in Note 4 of these notes to the accounts. No non-compulsory accounting principles have been
applied. In addition, the Directors have prepared these annual accounts taking account of all the
accounting principles and regulations that must be applied and that have a significant effect on the said
annual accounts. Where an accounting principle is compulsory, there is no instance in which it has not
been applied.

**_d)_** **_Responsibility for information, critical aspects relating to the valuation and assessment of uncertainty_**

While preparing these annual accounts, estimates made by the Company’s Directors have been used in
order to place a value on some of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and undertakings shown in the
accounts themselves. These estimates basically refer to the following:

- The assessment of potential losses due to the impairment of certain assets (see Notes 4-c, 4-e and 4-f).

- The useful life of intangible assets, tangible assets and real estate investments (see Notes 4-a, 4-b
and 4-d).

- The fair value of certain financial instruments (Note 4-f).

- The forecast future taxable profits that make it probable that deferred tax assets will be recovered
(Note 15).

- The calculation of certain allowance coverage amounts (see Note 4-l).

Despite the fact that these estimates have been made on the basis of the best information available at the
end of the financial year 2015, it is possible that events occurring in the future may make it necessary to
modify them (either upwards or downwards) in coming years. This will be carried out, where necessary, in
the form of a prospective analysis, and the effects of any change to the said estimates will be recognised in
the relevant future profit and loss accounts.

**_e)_** **_Comparison of information_**

The information in these annual accounts relating to the financial year 2014 is presented solely for the
purposes of comparison with the information from the financial year 2015.

**2. Bases for presentation (Continued)**

**_a)_** **_Grouping of entries_**

Certain entries in the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the statement of changes to net equity
value and the cash flow statement are grouped together in order to facilitate understanding, though where
information is particularly significant it is shown in broken down form in the corresponding notes to the
accounts.

**_b)_** **_Changes to accounting criteria_**

There were no significant changes to accounting criteria during 2015 in comparison with the criteria
applied during 2014.

**_c)_** **_Correction of errors_**

During the preparation of these annual accounts, no significant errors were detected that involved
re-entering the amounts included in the annual accounts for the 2014 financial year.

**3. Application of the result**

The proposal for the application of the result from the financial year 2015, which has been drawn up by the
Company’s Directors and will be submitted for approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders, involves
allocating all profits for the year to the entry ‘‘Other reserves’’.

**4. Entry and valuation rules**

The main entry and valuation rules used by the Company when preparing its annual accounts for the
financial year 2015, pursuant to the rules set out in the Spanish General Chart of Accounts, were as
follows:

**_a)_** **_Intangible fixed assets_**

As a general rule, intangible fixed assets are initially valued at cost of acquisition or production cost.
Subsequently, they are valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where
applicable, minus losses incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in Note 4-d.
These assets are depreciated on the basis of their useful life.

The Company enters any loss that may have occurred in the registered value of these assets as the result of
their impairment in the accounts, using the entry headed ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of
fixed assets’’ in the profit and loss account as a contra entry. The criteria used to recognise losses due to
the impairment of these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of any losses due to impairment entered
in previous financial years are similar to those applied to tangible fixed assets, as explained in section d) of
this Note.

_Research and development costs_

The Company adheres to the criterion of entering the research and development costs that it has incurred
over the course of the year in the profit and loss account. However, research and development costs
become active when the following requirements are met:

- They are specifically individually defined by project and the cost can be clearly established.

- There are justifiable reasons to trust in the technical success and financial and commercial
profitability of the project.

Any assets generated in this way are depreciated using the straight line method over the course of their
useful life (a maximum of five years). In addition, where there are doubts regarding the technical success
or economic viability of the project, the amounts entered on the assets side of the balance sheet are
attributed directly to the profit and loss account for the financial year.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

_Patents, licences, trademarks and similar_

This heading includes the amounts paid to acquire patents and register the Company’s trademarks, and
items are valued initially at cost of acquisition or production cost, including registration and formal
certification costs. They are depreciated using the straight line method over 10 years.

This also includes the valuation of identifiable commercial trademarks that have emerged from the
combination of businesses during previous financial years. Trademarks are valued at their fair value on the
date of acquisition, minus the amount of the negative difference emerging from the said combination.

These assets, whose useful life has been classified as indefinite, given that it is not possible to forecast the
end of the period during which they are expected to generate incoming net cash streams for the Company
based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, are not depreciated. An analysis of their potential
impairment is made whenever there are signs of impairment, and at least once a year.

_IT applications_

IT applications include software acquired from third parties, and they are entered at their acquisition
price, which includes all the costs incurred until their effective entry into operation. These assets are
depreciated using the straight line method over a five-year period, from the moment that each application
enters operation.

Repair and maintenance costs incurred during the financial year are charged to the profit and loss account.
In this regard, charges in the form of maintenance services are entered as a cost in the profit and loss
account in the financial year in which they are incurred.

_Other aspects_

Spanish Act 22 of 20th July 2015, on the Auditing of Accounts, introduced certain changes to the Spanish
Commercial Code (Article 39.4) that affect intangible assets and goodwill. The new wording establishes
that intangible fixed assets are assets with a defined useful life, and when the useful life of such assets
cannot be estimated in a reliable way, they will be depreciated over a period of ten years, unless another
legal or regulatory provision establishes a different term. As regards goodwill, it is specified that, unless
otherwise demonstrated, this has a useful life of ten years. These changes will apply to all financial
statements referring to financial years commencing on or after 1st January 2016.

In addition, in December 2015 the ICAC published a Draft Royal Decree introducing changes to the
General Chart of Accounts/Rules for the Preparation of Consolidated Annual Accounts. This implements
the changes relating to accounting impact introduced in the aforementioned Commercial Code, though on
the date on which these annual accounts are being prepared, the said Royal Decree has not yet been
approved.

The Company is currently analysing the future impact of these changes, though given that the as yet
unapproved Royal Decree will include rules relating to the transitional period, it is not possible to give a
reliable estimate of their effects.

**_b)_** **_Tangible fixed assets_**

Tangible fixed assets are initially valued at their cost of acquisition or production cost, and subsequently
valued at cost minus the corresponding accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, minus losses
incurred as a result of impairment, pursuant to the criteria explained in Note 4-d.

The cost of replacing or refurbishing complete items and the cost of extending, modernising or improving
items in order to extend their useful life, productivity or economic yield are entered as a higher cost of the
tangible fixed asset in question, with the corresponding removal of the replaced or refurbished items.

Regular maintenance, conservation and repair costs are entered against the results, using the accrual
principle, as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

Any work carried out by the Company in relation to its own fixed assets is entered at the accumulated cost
that results from adding external costs to internal costs, calculated on the basis of the materials used, direct
labour costs and general manufacturing costs, based on rates of absorption similar to those applied for the
purposes of making stock valuations.

Where applicable, if a fixed asset requires a period of more than one year in order to reach operational
condition, capitalised costs will include any financial costs that have accrued prior to the item coming into
operation and have been charged by the supplier or result from loans or other forms of outside financing,
either specific or general, that are directly attributable to the acquisition or manufacture of the item in
question. The Company did not capitalise any amount in this regard during the financial years 2015 and
2014.

The Company depreciates tangible fixed assets by applying annual depreciation percentages calculated on
the basis of the estimated length of the useful life of such assets, as set out below:

**Estimated Useful Life (years)**
**Asset Type** **2015** **2014** **Method**

Constructions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30–65 44–100 Straight line
Technical equipment and machinery . . . 10–16 14–18 Straight line and declining balance
Other facilities, tools and furnishings . . 3–25 3–25 Straight line
Other fixed assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3, 12–6, 25 3, 12–6, 25 Straight line

During the current financial year, the Company Management has re-estimated the useful life of some of its
tangible fixed assets. This re-estimation was carried out on the basis of an internal technical study that took
account of the technical characteristics of the Company’s assets and current levels of business activity. The
impact of this change in estimates, which was entered by prospective application, involved entering a
higher amount for depreciation in the financial year 2015 compared with the amount that would have been
entered if the previous useful life estimates had been maintained, a total of A1,568,000.

Investments that cannot be separated from items used under leasing arrangements classified as operational
leases are entered as tangible fixed assets when they meet the requirements for definition as assets. These
investments are depreciated on the basis of their useful life, which will be the length of the lease or
assignment agreement, including any renewal term when there is evidence to support the fact that such a
renewal is going to occur, and when this is shorter than the economic life of the asset.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

**_c)_** **_Real estate investments_**

This section includes the values of land, buildings and other constructions that are maintained either for
exploitation under lease or to obtain a capital gain upon their sale, as a consequence of any increase in
their respective market prices that may apply in the future. For these assets, the Company applies the
valuation rules relating to tangible fixed assets.

**_e)_** **_Value impairment of intangible fixed assets, tangible fixed assets and real estate investments_**

At the end of each financial year, whenever there are signs of a fall in value, the Company uses the
so-called impairment test to estimate the possible existence of a fall in value that may reduce the
recoverable value of such assets to an amount that is lower than their book value. The recoverable value is
calculated as either the fair value minus sale costs or the operational value, whichever is higher. In the
event that the asset does not in itself generate cash flows independently from other assets, the Company
calculates the recoverable value of the cash flow-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

During the financial years 2015 and 2014, the Company entered certain impairments in relation to some of
its real estate assets (see Note 7).

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_f)_** **_Leases_**

Leases are classified as financial leases whenever it can be concluded from the terms and conditions of the
leases that the risks and benefits inherent in ownership of the asset forming the subject of the agreement
are transferred substantially to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operational leases.

_Financial leases_

In the financial leasing transactions in which the Company acts as lessee, the cost of the leased assets is
entered in the balance sheet on the basis of the nature of the item forming the subject of the agreement,
and a liability in the same amount is simultaneously entered. This amount will be the lower of either the
fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum amounts agreed at the beginning of the
lease, including any purchase option, when there is no reasonable doubt regarding the exercise of such an
option. This calculation will not include fees of a contingent nature, service costs or taxes that are
chargeable to the lessor. The total financial charge for the agreement is entered in the profit and loss
account for the financial year in which it is accrued, applying the effective interest rate method. Fees of a
contingent nature are entered as a cost in the year in which they are incurred.

Assets recorded for this kind of transaction are depreciated using criteria that are similar to the ones
applied to tangible fixed assets as a whole, taking account of their nature.

_Operational leases_

Operational leases are understood to be leases under which the lessor agrees to grant the lessee the right
to use an asset over a specific period of time in return for a single payment or a series of payments or fees,
so long as this is not a lease of a financial nature.

Any costs resulting from operational lease agreements are entered in the profit and loss account in the
financial year in which they are incurred.

Any charge or payment that may be made when arranging an operational lease will be treated as an
advance charge or payment and entered against the results over the term of the lease, as the benefits from
the leased asset are assigned or received.

The amount of the minimum fees to be paid and received in relation to operational lease agreements in
which the Company is respectively named as either lessor or lessee is not significant in relation to these
annual accounts.

**_f)_** **_Financial instruments_**

_f.1 Financial assets_

_Classification and initial valuation_

The financial assets owned by the Company are classified in the following categories:

a) Loans and accounts receivable: financial assets originating from the sale of goods or the provision of
services as part of the company’s normal business activities, or financial assets that, while not
originating from commercial operations, are not equity instruments or derivatives; any payments
collected are of a fixed and quantifiable amount and they are not traded on the markets.

b) Investments in the equity of group and associate companies: group companies are understood to be
those that are linked to the Company via a controlling relationship, while associated companies are
those over which the Company exercises a significant influence.

c) Guarantee bonds and deposits: these are entered in the amounts in which they were originally put in
place, which do not significantly differ from their fair value.

F-263


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

The financial assets included in the various categories indicated above are initially entered, in general
terms, at the fair value of the consideration handed over in payment plus any costs that can be directly
attributed to the transaction.

_Subsequent valuation_

Loans and accounts receivable are valued at their depreciated cost.

Investments in group and associated companies are valued at cost, minus, where applicable, the
accumulated value of any adjustments for impairment. These adjustments are calculated as the difference
between their book value and their recoverable value, which is understood to be either their fair value
minus sale costs, or the present value of future cash flows earned from the investment, whichever is higher.
In the absence of better evidence of the amount that may be recoverable, account is taken of the net equity
value of the subsidiary company, corrected by any unrealised capital gains that exist on the valuation date
(including goodwill, where it exists).

Financial assets available for sale are valued at their fair value, and the results of any changes to this fair
value are recorded under net equity value, until such a time as the asset is disposed of or suffers a value
impairment (of a stable or permanent nature), at which time the accumulated results previously entered
under net equity value are moved across to the profit and loss account. In this regard, an impairment (of a
permanent nature) is presumed if there has been a fall of more than 40% in the listed value of the asset, or
there has been a prolonged fall in this value over a period of one and a half years without any recovery in
its value.

The Company carries out an impairment test, at least at the end of each financial year, on any financial
assets that are not entered at their reasonable value. It is considered that there is objective evidence of
impairment if the recoverable value of the financial asset is lower than its book value. When such
impairment occurs, this is entered in the profit and loss account. In particular, as regards value adjustments
relating to commercial debtors and other accounts receivable, the rule used by the Company to calculate
the relevant value adjustments is to classify the amounts owing as doubtful debts.

_f.2 Financial liabilities_

Financial liabilities are debts and accounts payable that are owed to the Company and that have originated
from the purchase of goods or services during the company’s ordinary business operations, along with any
liabilities that do not have a commercial origin and cannot be regarded as derivative financial instruments.
At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Company classified all of its short-term financial liabilities as debts
and accounts payable.

Debts and accounts payable are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration received, adjusted to
take account of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are valued according
to their depreciated cost.

The Company removes financial liabilities when the obligations that gave rise to them disappear.

_f.3 Derivatives_

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to cover the risks to which its business activities,
operations and future cash flows are exposed. Such risks mainly arise as the result of changes in interest
rates. Within the framework of this kind of operation, the Company contracts financial hedging
instruments.

In order to allow these financial instruments to be classified as hedging for accounts entries, they must
initially be reassigned as such and the hedging connection must be documented. The Company must also
check, both initially and then at regular intervals throughout their life (at least each time the accounts are
closed) that the hedging connection remains effective, that is to say, that it can be foreseeably expected
that changes to the fair value of or cash flow yield from the hedged item (when attributed to the hedged

F-264

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

risk) are almost entirely offset by changes to the fair value of or cash flow yield from the hedging
instrument, and that, retrospectively, hedging results have varied within a range of 80% and 125% of the
results of the hedged item.

Up to the financial year 2014, the Company used derivative financial instruments to provide partial cover
for the risk of changes in interest rates. During the financial year 2015, these operations were cancelled,
which had an insignificant effect on these annual accounts.

**_g)_** **_Stocks_**

Stocks are valued at their acquisition price, production price or net realizable value, whichever is the
lowest. Commercial discounts, lower prices obtained, other similar amounts and the interest included in
the base amount of debited items are deducted when calculating the acquisition price. Discounts for
prompt payment are also included as a lower purchase price, whether shown in the invoice or not.

The production cost includes direct material costs and, where applicable, direct labour costs and general
manufacturing costs.

The net realizable value represents an estimate of the sale price minus all the costs that are estimated in
order to complete manufacture, plus any costs that will be incurred during the course of the marketing,
sales and distribution processes.

When allocating value to its inventories, the Company uses the FIFO method.

The Company makes the appropriate value adjustments, entering them as a cost in the profit and loss
account, when the net realisable value of stocks is lower than their cost of acquisition (or production cost).

**_h)_** **_Subsidies, donations and bequests received_**

When accounting subsidies, donations and bequests received, the Company applies the following rules:

d) Non-repayable subsidies, donations and bequests: These are valued at the fair value of the amount
granted or item received, depending on whether or not it is in monetary form, and they are entered in
the results in proportion to the amount allocated to depreciation of the item benefiting from the
subsidy over the period or, where applicable, when it is disposed of or a value adjustment is made for
its impairment, with the exception of amounts received from members or owners, which are entered
directly as shareholder equity and do not constitute any kind of income.

e) Repayable subsidies: While they remain repayable, they are entered as liabilities.

f) Operating subsidies: These are entered in the results at the time at which they are awarded, unless
they are used to finance operational deficits in future years, in which case they are entered in the
relevant financial year. If they are awarded in order to finance specific costs, they are entered as the
costs being financed accrue.

**_i)_** **_Transactions in foreign currency_**

The operational currency used by the Company is the euro. Consequently, all transactions in currencies
other than the euro are regarded as being denominated in foreign currency and entered according to the
rates of exchange that apply on the transaction date.

At the end of the financial year, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are
converted at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet. Any profit or loss that emerges is
entered directly in the profit and loss account for the financial year in which it occurs.

**_j)_** **_Tax on profits_**

The cost or income from tax on profits comprises the part that relates to the cost or income from current
tax and the part that corresponds to the cost or income due to deferred tax.

F-265


-----

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

Current tax is the amount that the Company pays as a consequence of the tax payable on the income it has
earned during the financial year. Any deductions or other tax advantages that apply to the tax amount,
excluding withheld taxes and payments on account, plus any tax losses that can be offset from previous
financial years and that can be applied during the current year, lead to a decrease in the current tax
amount.

The cost or income from deferred tax corresponds to the recognition and cancellation of assets and
liabilities resulting from deferred taxes. These include the time-period differences identified as amounts
that are expected to be payable or recoverable due to the difference between the asset and liability
amounts shown in the books and their taxable value, together with any negative tax bases that are pending
offset and credits due as the result of deductions against tax that are not fiscally applied. These amounts
are entered by applying the time-period difference or corresponding credit to the tax rate at which they are
expected to be recovered or paid.

All time-period differences are entered as deferred tax liabilities, except for those that originate from the
initial entry of goodwill or other assets and liabilities in operations that do not affect either the tax result or
the book result and do not constitute a combination of businesses.

Meanwhile, deferred tax assets are only entered to the extent that it is considered probable that the
Company will earn sufficient tax profits in the future for them to be offset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from operations that lead to direct charges or payments being
entered as asset entries are also accounted for with a contra entry in net equity value.

Upon closing each set of accounts, the deferred tax assets recorded are reappraised and the relevant
adjustments are made in the event that there are any doubts regarding their future recovery. Any deferred
tax assets not recorded in the balance sheet are also appraised at the close of each year, and these are
entered in the accounts whenever it becomes probable that they could be recovered against future taxable
profits.

In the financial year 2014, the company paid taxes under the rules governing consolidation. For the
financial year 2015, the Company’s Directors have decided to change to the system for the submission of
individual tax returns.

**_k)_** **_Income and expenses_**

Income and expenses are entered on the basis of accrual criteria, i.e. at the time of the actual flow of goods
and services that they represent, regardless of the time at which the monetary or financial flow resulting
from such goods and services occurs. Income is valued at the fair value of the payment received minus
discounts and taxes.

Income from sales is entered at the moment that all significant risk and benefit inherent in ownership of
the item being sold is transferred to the purchaser, and neither current management of that item nor
effective control thereover are subsequently maintained .

As regards income from the provision of services, this is recognised on the basis of the degree to which
such services have been completed on the date of the balance sheet, provided that the results of the
transaction can be reliably estimated.

Interests received from financial assets are entered on the basis of the effective interest rate method, while
dividends are entered when the shareholders’ right to receive them is announced. In any case, any interest
or dividends accruing on financial assets subsequent to their acquisition are entered as income in the profit
and loss account.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_g)_** **_Provisions and contingencies_**

When preparing these annual accounts, the Company’s Directors have differentiated between the
following:

- Provisions: liabilities covering obligations that remained outstanding on the date of the balance sheet
as a consequence of past events that are likely to emerge and could result in damage to the Company’s
assets of an unknown value and over an unknown time. These amounts are entered on the balance
sheet in the form of allowance provisions in the current most probable value that the Company
estimates it would have to pay in order to be released from the obligation, and

- Contingent liabilities: potential obligations arising as a consequence of past events, the emergence of
which is conditional upon whether or not one or more future events arise that are beyond the control
of the Company.

These annual accounts record all the significant provisions in respect of which it is estimated that there is a
probability that the obligation will need to be covered. Contingent liabilities are not entered in the annual
accounts, though information on such liabilities is given insofar as they are not classified as remote.

Provisions are valued at the current value of the best possible estimate of the amount that will be required
to cancel or transfer the obligation, bearing in mind all available information relating to the event and its
consequences, and any adjustments arising as a result of the updating of such provisions are entered as a
financial cost as they accrue.

Any compensation to be received from a third party at the time at which the obligation is settled, provided
that there is no doubt that such compensation will be received, is entered as an asset, except in the event
there is a legal connection through which part of the risk has been outsourced, under which the Company
will not be obliged to assume liability; in this situation, the compensation will be taken into account when
estimating the amount that is to be recorded, where applicable, for the provision in question.

**_m)_** **_Interrupted operations_**

An interrupted operation is any part of the Company that has been transferred or disposed of in any other
way, or that has been classified as ‘held for sale’ and, among other conditions, represents a business line or
significant area that can be regarded as separate from the rest.

For this type of operation, the Company includes a sole entry in its profit and loss account under the
heading ‘‘Result for the financial year from interrupted operations net of taxes’’, which includes both the
post-tax result for interrupted operations, and the post-tax result entered as a result of their valuation at
fair value minus the costs of the sale or disposal of the items from which the interrupted activity is made
up.

In addition, when operations are classified as interrupted, the Company records the amount obtained in
the previous financial year from the activities classified as interrupted, under the accounts heading
mentioned above, on the closing date of the financial year to which the annual accounts refer.

**_d)_** **_Asset items of an environmental nature_**

Asset items of an environmental nature are understood to be lasting assets that are used during the course
of the Company’s activities for the main purpose of minimising environmental impact, protecting and
improving the environment, including the reduction or elimination of future contamination.

The tangible fixed asset items designed to minimise any environmental impact that could result from the
activities engaged in by the Company are valued at cost price, adjusted by their accumulated depreciation.

Any extension, modernisation and improvement costs are capitalised when they represent an extension of
the estimated useful life of the assets in question. Otherwise they are treated as costs for that financial
year, along with repair and maintenance costs.

F-267

**Keraben Grupo, S.A.**

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

Any costs that are incurred in relation to the protection and improvement of the environment and that do
not represent an investment in tangible fixed assets are entered in the results for the year in which they are
incurred, regardless of the time at which the cash or financial stream resulting from such costs materialises.

Amounts incurred in the management of environmental effects resulting from the business activities
engaged in by the company are classified as environmental costs, as are the costs that result from the
Company’s existing environmental undertakings. These include the costs incurred as a result of preventing
pollution in relation to the Company’s current operational activities, the treatment of residue and waste,
decontamination, restoration, environmental management and environmental auditing.

The Company follows the rule of accounting for any potential undertakings at the moment at which it
becomes aware of them.

Allowance provision for probable or certain environment-related liabilities, on-going lawsuits and pending
compensation and obligations of an undetermined amount, where not covered by the insurance policies
that have been taken out, is set aside at the moment that the liability or obligation that will result in
compensation or payment arises.

**_o)_** **_Greenhouse gas emission rights_**

‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ are entered in the balance sheet when the company becomes eligible for
such rights. When such rights are acquired free of charge or at a price that is substantially lower than their
market value, the acquisition price is considered to be their market price at the time of acquisition or at the
beginning of the calendar year. In this case, they will be entered with a contra entry under ‘‘Subsidies,
donations and bequests received’’ in the Net Equity Value section of the balance sheet, once any deferred
tax associated with them has been deducted.

After being entered as an asset, emission rights are valued at their acquisition price or production price
and are not subject to depreciation. The necessary provisions are set aside in order to give them their lower
market value at the end of each financial year, whenever their book value may not be recoverable from the
generation of sufficient income to cover all costs and expenses.

Costs attached to the emission of greenhouse gases require the corresponding provision to be made for
risks and costs, and this provision is maintained until the moment that the Company has to cancel the
obligation in question by handing over the corresponding emission rights.

Costs accrue as greenhouse gases are emitted, and they are entered under ‘‘Other operating costs-Costs
from emission of greenhouse effect gasses’’ in the attached profit and loss accounts for 2015 and 2014,
calculated according to the emission rights that have been transferred.

Any profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of a right is calculated as the difference
between the sale price and the book value of the asset, and this is entered in the profit and loss account.

Subsidies of a non-repayable nature associated with emission rights acquired free of charge or at a price
that is substantially below their market price are entered as ‘‘Subsidies, donations and bequests received’’
and charged to the profit and loss account in the same proportion as the costs incurred from the gas
emissions relating to the subsidised emission rights.

**_h)_** **_Related party transactions_**

The Company carries out all related party transactions at market prices. In addition, its transfer pricing
policy is properly supported on the basis of the requirements set out in current tax legislation, and the
Company’s Directors therefore believe that there are no significant risks in this regard that could give rise
to liabilities worthy of consideration in the future.

**4. Entry and valuation rules (Continued)**

**_i)_** **_Current and non-current entries_**

Current assets are understood to be assets that are linked to the normal business cycle, which is generally
regarded a one-year period, and the term is also understood to apply to assets that are due to maturity or
be disposed of or realised in the short term following the end of the financial year, financial assets
maintained for negotiation and cash and other equivalent liquid assets. Assets that do not meet these
requirements are classified as non-current.

Similarly, current liabilities are liabilities that are linked to the normal business cycle, financial liabilities
maintained for negotiation (excluding financial derivatives with a settlement term of more than one year)
and, in general, all obligations that are due to mature or be cancelled in the short-term. Otherwise they are
classified as non-current.

As indicated in Notes 4-a and 5, the amount of 14,008,000 euros under ‘‘trademarks, patents, licenses and
similars’’ in the section headed, as the result of a valuation made by the Company’s Directors during the
financial year 2010, under the context of the amalgamation of businesses that occurred in that year.
According to the estimates and projections available to the Company’s Directors, the cash flow provisions
attributed to the mentioned trademarks will result in the recovery of their net book value.

**Greenhouse gas emission rights**

The balance shown under the heading ‘‘Greenhouse gas emission rights’’ corresponds to a valuation of the
rights purchased in previous financial years and assigned free of charge to the Company for the financial
year 2015, pursuant to the 2013-2020 National Allocation Plan. 64,909 rights were allocated to the
Company for the financial year 2015 (66,091 rights allocated in 2014).

79,827 rights were used up during this financial year (74,996 rights during 2014), each corresponding to one
metric tonne of CO2, and the Company has therefore set aside a provision amounting to 528,000 euros
during this financial year (350,000 euros in 2014), entered under the heading ‘‘Other Operating CostsCosts due to emission of greenhouse effect gasses’’ in the profit and loss account for the 2015 financial
year. Similarly, during 2015, the Company charged an amount of496,000 euros to ‘‘Subsidies, donations
and bequests received’’, entering a credit in the attached profit and loss account, corresponding to the
subsidies associated with the emission rights consumed (380,000 euros during 2014).

heading ‘‘Advances and fixed assets under construction’’, correspond to improvements to the Company’s
production facilities, which are scheduled to be completed over the coming year, as part of the investment

suppliers, the firm undertakings to purchase tangible fixed assets assumed by the Company by the end of
the 2015 financial year amounted to approximately 1,931thousands euros (approximately 1,800 thousands
euros at the close of 2014).

other group companies in any significant amount.

**Information relating to removals**

The items removed during 2015, as shown in the foregoing table, correspond to some items that have been
sold during the financial period by a total amount of 92.000 Euros, and others that have been deregistered.
The net result of these deregistration has ascended to an amount of 18.000 Euros (Profit), which is entered
under the heading ‘‘Impairment and income from the disposal of fixed assets’’ on the attached profit and
loss account for the financial year 2015.

its fixed asset items may be exposed. At the end of the 2015 and 2014 financial years, the net book value of
its fixed assets was completely covered by these policies.

**Information on the nature and level of risk of financial instruments**

The management of the Company’s financial risk is centralised in its Finance Department, which has the
necessary mechanisms in place to control exposure to variations in both interest rates and exchange rates,

**Report on the financial year ending 31 December 2015 (Continued)**

**9. Financial investments (Continued)**

along with exposure to credit and liquidity risk. The following are the main financial risks that have an
impact on the Company:

**_e)_** **_Credit risk_**

In general, the Company keeps its cash and equivalent liquid assets with financial institutions with a high
credit rating. In addition, a significant proportion of its turnover and accounts receivable from non-related
clients are guaranteed by means of credit insurance policies.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that there is no significant concentrated third-party credit risk, since
no client represents more than 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable. Individual credit limits are
established on the basis of both internal and external ratings, in accordance with the limits set by the
Company. The use of these credit limits is regularly monitored.

**_f)_** **_Liquidity risk_**

In order to ensure liquidity and attend to all the payment undertakings resulting from its business
activities, during the 2014 financial year the Company reached an agreement with its financial institutions
under which it restructured the payment timetable for its financial debt in order to bring it into line with its
expected cash generation, as well as non-arranging additional operational financing lines detailed in
Note 14. As consequence, the Company’s Directors believe that the Company has sufficient financial
resources to engage in its normal business activities.

**_c)_** **_Market risk (including interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and other price-related risk)_**

Both the Company’s cash and its financial debts are exposed to interest rate risk, which could have a
significant effect on its financial results and cash flow. However, some of the Company’s borrowings were
arranged at a fixed interest rate (see Note 14).

As regards exchange rate risk, this is mainly concentrated in the sale of finished product to countries in
America and Asia, which are priced in US dollars. The Company has specific and adequate policies in
place to monitor and manage exchange rate risk in the different currencies in which it operates.

**10. Stocks**

The movements in value adjustments due to impairment entered under the heading ‘‘Stocks’’ in 2015 and
2014 were as follows:

**Thousands of**

These value adjustments were caused, in the main, by the renewal of the product catalogue.

At 31st December 2015 and 2014 there were no stocks of significant value deposited in the custody of third
parties. The Company also did not maintain undertakings to purchase stocks in a significant amount at the
end of the financial year 2015.

The Company’s policy consists on contracting insurance policies to cover any potential risk to which its
stocks may be subject. At the end of the 2015 and 2014 financial years, these insurance policies almost
entirely covered the value of the Company’s stocks.

**11. Equity Value**

**Share capital**

At the end of the financial years 2015 and 2014, the share capital was represented by 880,412 shares, each
with a nominal value of 6.01 euros, all of them totally subscribed and paid up. All the shares representing
the share capital grant the same rights, and they are not admitted for trading on the Stock Market. In order
to guarantee the financing operations described in Note 14, an _in rem pledge right has been established_
over 100% of the Company’s shares.

At the end of the financial year 2015, the only company with a holding of more than 10% in the Company’s
share capital was Tensile-Keraben Holdings S.`a.r.l, S.L., which holds a share of 77.3% in the Company’s
share capital (79.3% in 2014).

A company operation was carried out during the financial year 2014 which led to the following effects:

- The agricultural business was split off and subsequently allocated to a newly created company, leading
to a share capital reduction of 816,000 euros.

- A share capital increase was made in the amount of 4,196,000 euros, through the issue of 698,173
shares each with a par value of 6.01 euros, with an issue premium of 54,147,000 euros.

- Offset of credits generated with a shareholder that took on part of the Company’s financial debts. The
Company then unregistered the financial liability in its accounts and recognised the corresponding
increase in shareholder equity in an equivalent amount at the fair value of the cash contribution made,
in accordance with BOICAC 79 Consultation No. 5. The difference that resulted from this operation
was entered in the profit and loss account, giving income in the amount of 10,566,000 euros and a
reduction in the amount of the issue premium.

- Trading of shares representing 2% of Keraben Grupo, S.A.’s share capital, by virtue of which the
majority shareholder became the owner of 77.3% of the share capital. This transaction was registered
with Castell´on Mercantile Registry on 30th March 2015.

**Legal reserve**

Pursuant to the Spanish Capital Companies Act, limited companies must allocate an amount equal to 10%
of their profits for the year to the legal reserve, until this reserve is equal to at least 20% of the share
capital figure. The legal reserve may be used to increase the share capital using the portion of the reserve
that exceeds 10% of the increased share capital figure. Except as mentioned above, and provided that it
does not exceed 20% of the share capital figure, this reserve may only be used to offset losses, provided
that there are no other reserves available for this purpose. At the end of the financial year 2015, this
reserve was fully constituted (partially constituted at the end of 2014).

**Reserve under Article 80.4 of Act 2/1995**

This reserve, amounting up to 28 thousand euros at the end of the financial years 2014 and 2015,
correspond to a capital share reduction performed by Kanban, S.L., an acquired company in the fiscal year
2009.

**Dividend distribution**

The distribution of any profits is prohibited until research and development costs have been completely
amortized, unless the amount of available reserves is at least equal to the amount of these costs that has
not been amortized. As a consequence, at the time at which voluntary reserves are generated,
349,000 euros will be unavailable.

- Senior tranche: syndicated loan granted by an initial amount of 68.1 million euros.

- Asset tranche: syndicated loan granted by an amount of 12 million euros.

- The Company can repay the principal in advance, either wholly or in part, without incurring penalties
of any kind.

- The interest rate is tied to the Euribor, plus a market differential in the case of the senior tranche, and
a fixed interest rate that will vary between 1% and 3% for the asset tranche, based on a
pre-established timetable.

- Compliance with certain financial conditions during the term of the financing, In this regard, at the
end of the financial years 2015 and 2014, the Company was in compliance with all the financial and
other conditions required under the various financing agreements that remained in force.

In order to ensure compliance with the obligations assumed under the syndicated loan and operational
financing facilities described above, a number of guarantees in favour of credit entities have been put in
place, among which we would make particular mention of the following:

- Senior Tranche’’: joint and several first-call guarantee by Construplas, S.L., first-rank real estate
mortgage over various properties (the net book value of which at the close of the financial year 2015
amounted to 67,755,000 euros), a first-rank asset mortgage established over the ‘‘Keraben’’
trademark, pledge over all the shares in Keraben Grupo, S.A.

- ‘‘Asset Tranche’’: first-rank real estate mortgage over various real estate assets (see Note 7), whose net
book value at the close of the financial year 2015 amounted to 10,949,000 euros.

- In addition, there are certain obligations relating to a compulsory early repayment of the senior
tranche, by way of a cash sweep, depending on compliance with certain financial ratios. These
obligations will come into force from the coming financial year 2016, and compliance with the
financial ratios in question must be calculated on the basis of the figures at 31st December 2015. On
this basis, the Company does not expect to make any early repayment of this debt during the coming
financial year.

The amounts shown in the entries under the heading ‘‘Financial lease creditors’’, recording short- and
long-term liabilities in the attached balance sheet at 31st December 2015, correspond to the amounts
pending payment under the financial leasing agreements maintained by the Company, as described in
Note 8.

The amount entered under ‘‘Other financial liabilities’’ in the current and non-current liabilities section of
the attached balance sheet corresponds to loans granted by various Public Entities, and other debts
maintained with asset suppliers. These loans do not accrue any kind of interest, and the implicit interest is
not significant. In order to calculate the fair value of this debt, the Company has taken its par value, which
does not differ significantly from its current net value.

**Deposits and guarantees**

At 31st December 2015, the guarantees put in place by the Company through financial institutions
amounted to 2,793,000 euros, and these mainly referred to bonds provided as guarantees for debts in
favour of a Reciprocal Guarantee Company and a company in which the Company has a shareholding. In
respect of these amounts, the Company’s Directors have assessed the potential situations that could result
in outgoings for the Company, and these are entered under the heading ‘‘Short-term provisions’’ in the
attached balance sheet as of 31st December 2015. (See Note 13)

**Cash and other equivalent liquid assets.**

At 31st December 2015 and 2014, the amount shown under ‘‘Cash and other equivalent liquid assets’’
related almost entirely to the cash amounts available in the current accounts held by the Company at
various reputable financial institutions.

**Reconciliation between accounting income and taxable income**

Company Tax is calculated on the basis of financial or accounting income, which is obtained in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and which does not necessarily have to coincide with taxable
income, this being understood to mean the tax base.

Accounting income and taxable income for Company Tax purposes in the financial years 2015 and 2014
were reconciled as follows:

**Information on permanent differences**

The increase on taxable income due to permanent differences in the fiscal year 2015 correspond, basically,
with taxes paid abroad, differences between fiscal and accountable amortization, and expenses which are
considered to be non-deductible by the Law 27/2014 on Company’s Income Tax.

The reductions on taxable income due to permanent differences in the fiscal year 2015 correspond,
basically with: i) impairment reversal of a share in a related company sold during the fiscal year, whose
endowment was considered on previous fiscal years as a permanent increase on the taxable income by an
amount of 1,545,000 Euros, and ii) with the adjustment performed to the taxable income due to the
reception of dividends from Group companies during the fiscal year, by an amount of 1,022 thousand euros
(See Note 9.1)

Meanwhile in 2014, the Company adjusted the book result by permanent differences amounting to
13,711 thousand euros, the majority of which related to income produced throughout the liquidation of
two companies in the group as well as the recognition of income in the amount of 10,566 thousand euros
relating to the cancellation of a liability by means of a share capital increase through the offsetting of
credits (see Note 11).

**Information on temporary differences**

The difference between the tax burdens allocated to the actual and previous fiscal periods, and the tax
burden already paid or to be paid from those fiscal years, has its origin, basically, in the temporary
differences originated in the fiscal year itself by an amount of 12,361, thousand euros, from which its major
part correspond, to impairment of real estate investments, registered during the fiscal period by an amount
of 11,276 thousand euros under the heading ‘‘Deterioration and results from sale of assets—Deterioration
and losses’’ on the attached profit and loss account form the fiscal year 2015.

At the same time, the Company has adjusted to the accounting result, temporary differences with its origin
on previous fiscal years, which correspond mainly with: i) the partial reversal of the adjustment performed
to the impairment endowment of tangible and intangible assets, due to fiscal limitation on the deduction of
such expense, introduced on Act 16 of 27th December 2012, which implemented various tax-related
measures aimed at consolidating the public finances and boosting economic activity, by an amount of
1,076 thousand euros, and ii)to the reversal of the accelerated amortization applied on previous fiscal years
by an amount of 1,068 thousand euros.

**Total costs/(income) for tax purposes entered in the profit and loss account . . . . . . . .** **1,049** **(1,727)**

The section ‘‘Adjustments for changes on income tax rates’’ in the above table relates, mainly, to the impact
on assets and liabilities during 2015 and 2014 as the result of the deferred tax associated with the change in
the applicable Company Tax rate approved for the forthcoming year, which has been cut to 28% for 2015
and is expected to be further reduced to 25% for the financial year beginning in 2016 and subsequent
years.

The legislation in relation to Company Tax establishes a range of tax incentives with the aim of
encouraging research and development and technological innovation, exports and training activities. At the
end of the financial year 2015, the Company had made deductions in this regard, pending application
against future Company Tax payments, in the amount of 4,448 thousand euros (5,104 thousand euros in
2014), along with deductions relating to other items in the amount of 1,227 thousand euros
(1,503 thousand euros in 2014).

**Deferred tax assets.**

The Company’s tax assets, differentiating between temporary differences, negative tax bases and
deductions pending application, can be broken down as of the end of 2015 and 2014 as follows:

**Thousands of euros**

The deferred tax assets referred above have been recorded in the balance sheet because the Company’s
Directors believe that, according to estimates of the Company’s future results, positive tax bases will be
obtained in sufficient amounts to ensure that these assets will be able to be recovered within the term set
out in law to this end.

**Negative tax bases pending to be offset**

In accordance with current legislation, negative tax bases from one financial year can be offset for tax
purposes against positive tax bases from subsequent financial years, and there is no limit on the number of
years in which they can be offset under the tax legislation currently in force. However, these negative tax
bases can be modified as a consequence of an inspection relating to the financial years in which they were
generated.

In 2015, this could only be applied up to a maximum of 25% of the taxable base for the year, though this
limit rises to 60% in 2016 and further to 70% for 2017 and subsequent years.

At the end of 2015, the company retained negative tax bases pending application in the amount of
23,716 thousand euros (29,887 thousand euros at 31 December 2014), as broken down below.

basically, within a period of fifteen and eighteen years following the financial year in which they were
generated, depending if the majority of deductions relate to research and development (18 years) or the
remaining deductions(15 years).

The increase in value from this combination of businesses that was completed during the financial year
2010 under the terms of the accounting regulations in force did not have any fiscal effects, in other words,
the increased value was not included in the tax base of the company obliged to pay tax, meaning that the
items whose value had been increased in relation to their previous value in the books of the transferring
company were depreciated for tax purposes on the basis of this latter value. In addition, the reduced value
was not included in the tax base, and the depreciation for tax purposes of the corresponding items, which
was the same as the book depreciation, was calculated using the new base amount.

As regards to the assets and liabilities that were included in the described merger, a breakdown of the
value adjustments made as a result of the combination of businesses is shown in the following table:

iii) In the 2012 financial year, Keraben Grupo, S.A. applied the deduction of losses due to the impairment
of shareholdings in group, and associate companies, as provided for in Article 12.3 of Royal
Legislative Decree 4/2004 (Consolidated Text of the Company Tax Act, ‘‘TRLIS’’), along with the
reversal of the associated impairment. To this end, the following table provides the information

**Financial years pending verification and inspection processes**

Pursuant to the legislation currently in force, taxes may not be regarded as having been completely settled
until the tax returns submitted have been inspected by the tax authorities, or until the time-bar period has
been exceeded. At the end of the 2015 financial year, the periods 2012 to 2015 of the Company’s operation
remained open for inspection in respect of Company Tax, while the last four years remained open for
inspection in respect of all other applicable taxes. Given the different potential interpretations that can be
made of the tax regulations, the results of any inspections that may be carried out by the tax authorities in
the future in relation to years that remain subject to inspection could give rise to tax liabilities, the amount
of which cannot currently be quantified in any objective way. However, the Company’s Directors believe
that the said taxes have been adequately settled, meaning that even in the event that differences arise in
respect of the interpretation of the regulations in force as regards the fiscal approach applied to the
Company’s operations, any eventual liabilities, will not have a significant effect on these annual accounts.

Meanwhile, on the 4th July 2014, the Tax Agency initiated inspections corresponding to Corporation Tax
from periods 2010 to 2011, as well as VAT and withholding or payment on account of income from work or
professionals, movable capital and property leasing presented between 2010 and 2011. At the date of the
formulation of these accounts, such inspections have not yet finished. However, the Company’s Directors
have recognized in the actual accounts its best estimation with respect to the impacts, which could be
derived from such actions, based on the disposable information at the date of formulation. No additional
impacts are expected derived from such inspection apart fromm those already recognized at the year end
of 2015.

**17. Environmental information**

The Company aims to ensure that engagement in its industrial activity is compatible with preservation of
the environment. To this end it has equipment and facilities among its tangible fixed assets that are
exclusively and specifically designed to minimise the environmental impact of its production processes and
the products that it places on the market, the net cost and net book value of which amount respectively to
3,878 thousand and 3,027 thousand euros (3,563 thousand euros and 2,911 thousand euros respectively in
2014). The provision for the depreciation of these assets amounted to 199 thousand euros for the 2015
financial year (194 thousand euros in 2014).

Furthermore, in the normal course of its business activity, and as part of its environmental protection
processes, the Company incurred during the financial year 2015, costs relating to such processes amounting
to approximately 732 thousand euros (approximately 494 thousand euros during 2014).

The Company’s Directors do not believe that there are any risks or contingencies arising from
environmental issues that could have a significant impact on these annual accounts, and for that reason
these annual accounts do not contain any allowance provision in this regard.

**Information on greenhouse gas emission rights**

European Parliament Directive 2003/87/EC was published in October 2003 and established undertakings
to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. European Parliament and Council Resolution 2009/29/EC of
23 April 2009 revised the rules for the period from 2013 to 2020. These Directives were enacted in Spanish
law by means of Royal Decree 1,722 of 28 December 2012, which introduced aspects relating to the
allocation of emission rights within the framework of Act 1 of 9th March 2005, which in turn regulated the
rules governing the trading of greenhouse gas emission rights. The allocation of rights to facilities eligible
to receive the free allocation of emission rights for the period from 2013 to 2020 was calculated by applying
the allocation methodology set out in European Commission Decision 2011/278/EU.

In the individual allocation of rights for the period from 2013 to 2020, the Company was awarded
64,909 tonnes free of charge for the 2015 financial year. The issue of greenhouse gases during the financial
year 2015 was estimated at 79,827 tonnes (see Notes 5 and 11) (74,996 tonnes during 2014).

There were no future agreements on emission rights at the close of the financial year. There were no
contingencies for penalties and similar items under Act 1/2005 at the close of the financial year.

**19. Other information (Continued)**

**Financing structure**

The Company forms part of the Tensile Group, the ultimate parent of which is Tensile Capital GP LLC.
However In the Company acts independently from its group in terms of financial structure, obtaining
directly the necessary financial resources from local financial entities, for the development of its activity as
detailed in Note 14. The Company’s Directors believe that, both, the disposable discount credit lines, and
the long-term financing, will allow the Company to adequately manage all their financing requirements.

**Information on situations involving conflicts of interest among the Company’s Directors**

With regard to the contents of Article 229 of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Capital Companies Act,
the Directors have informed the Company that, during the financial year 2015, neither they nor the
individuals or companies to which they are related, as defined in Article 231 of the said Act, were affected
by situations involving a conflict of interest, as provided for in the aforementioned Article 229, and neither
the Board of Directors nor the other Directors were sent any communication of the kind provided for in
paragraph 3 of the said Article.

**Information on deferred payments to suppliers. Third Additional Provision. ‘‘Duty to Inform’’ under**
**Act 15 of 5 July 2010.**

Act 15 of 5th July 2010, which amended Act 3 of 29th December 2004, which established measures to
combat late payment in commercial transactions, established that ‘‘Companies must expressly include
information in the notes to their annual accounts regarding the payment terms they apply to suppliers’’. In
addition, the ruling of 29 January 2016 by the Spanish Institute of Accounting and Accounts Auditing
(‘‘ICAC’’) sets out the information to be included in the notes in order to comply with the said Act, and this
will apply to all annual accounts for financial years beginning from 1st January 2015 onwards.

The information required for the financial year 2015 under the third additional provision of the
aforementioned ruling is as follows:

**2015**
**Days**

Average supplier payment term . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 85

The ICAC ruling of 29th January 2016 establishes that the annual accounts statements for the first year in
which this applies will not include comparative information relating to this new obligation, the accounts
being classified as initial accounts for the purposes of this information.

The data shown in the above table regarding payments to suppliers refers to suppliers that are, by their
very nature, commercial creditors as the result of debts with suppliers of goods and services, in such a way
that this includes data relating to the entries ‘‘Suppliers’’, ‘‘Suppliers, group and associate companies’’ and
‘‘Miscellaneous creditors’’ in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet.

The maximum legal payment term applicable to the Company in the financial year 2015, pursuant to
Act 11 of 26 July 2013, which implemented Act 3 of 29th December 2004, which in turn established
measures to combat late payment in commercial operations, is 30 days, unless there is an agreement
between the parties, in which case the maximum term would be 60 days (the same as the term for 2014).

**Independent Auditors’ Report on Review of Interim Consolidated Financial Statements**

To the Sole Shareholder of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U.

**Introduction**

We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated balance sheet of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. (the
‘‘Company’’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’) as at 30 June 2018, the interim consolidated income
statement, the interim consolidated statement of changes in equity and the interim consolidated statement
of cash flows for the six month period then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting policies
and other explanatory information (‘‘the interim consolidated financial statements’’). The Directors are
responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the Spanish General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1514/2007 and the
Rules for the Preparation of Consolidated Annual Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1159/2010 and
subsequent amendments. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim consolidated
financial statements based on our review.

**Scope of Review**

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
‘‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’’. A review
of interim consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**Conclusion**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim consolidated financial statements do not give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. and its subsidiaries as at June 30, 2018, and of its consolidated
financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the six month period then ended, in accordance
with the Spanish General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1514/2007 and the Rules for the
Preparation of Consolidated Annual Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1159/2010 and subsequent
amendments.

In turn, since December 2017 the Mosaiq Group formed part of the Atitlan Group, which is domiciled in
Valencia. The statutory consolidated annual accounts of the Atitlan Group which are to be filed at the
Valencia Mercantile Registry. At December 31, 2017 the Company was wholly owned, by its sole
shareholder is Obinesa Grupo Industrial, S.L.U.

On August 7, 2018, Victoria PLC, through an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary named Sandover
Investments, S.L.U., acquired the entire share capital of Cer´amica Saloni S.A.U. (see note 27).

The Company holds investments in subsidiaries. Details of investments in subsidiaries are provided in
Appendix I. All subsidiaries have been consolidated. No investees are listed on any stock exchange market.

During the six months periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 there have not been changes in the
perimeter of consolidation.

**(2) Basis of Presentation**

(a) True and fair view

The directors have authorised the interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2018 for issue and the interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2018 have been prepared in accordance with prevailing legislation, the Spanish General
Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1514/2007 and the Rules for the Preparation of Consolidated
Annual Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1159/2010 and subsequent amendments to give a true and fair
view of the interim consolidated equity and interim consolidated financial position at June 30, 2018 and
interim consolidated results of operations, interim consolidated changes in equity, and interim
consolidated cash flows for the six months period ended June 30, 2018.

In accordance with prevailing legislation, the Company is the parent of a group of companies. In
accordance with financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, consolidated financial
statements must be prepared to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group, the results
of operations and changes in its equity and cash flows for the period of six months ended June 30, 2018.
Nevertheless, as permitted by section 2 of article 43 of the Spanish Code of Commerce, the Company does
not prepare statutory consolidated annual accounts as they are a subgroup of the Mosaiq Group
mentioned in note 1, who files statutory consolidated annual accounts in Spain.

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements for the six months period ended June 30,
2018 have not been prepared to comply with legal requirements in Spain, but in relation to a possible bond
issuance process which is planned to be carried out by the current ultimate parent company of the Group.

**(2) Basis of Presentation (Continued)**

(b) Comparative information

As mentioned in note 1, the Group was integrated in the Mosaiq Group, a higher-level Spanish group,
meaning that the Parent Company is not obliged to present statutory consolidated annual accounts as
provided in section 2 of article 43 of the Commercial Code, as the Mosaiq Group filed statutory
consolidated annual accounts. However, according to note 2.a), 2017 was the first year in which the Group
had voluntarily prepared interim consolidated financial statements. As a consequence, the acquisition date
of the consolidated companies, to the effect of applying the consolidation method, must be referred to the
acquisition/constitution date in the Mosaiq Group to which they belonged at June 30, 2018.

The unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2018 and the notes thereto include
corresponding figures for December 31, 2017. The unaudited interim consolidated income statement,
unaudited interim consolidated statement of changes in equity, unaudited interim consolidated statement
of cash flows and the notes thereto for the six months period ended June 30, 2018 include unaudited
corresponding figures for the six month period ended June, 30 2017.

As a result of the acquisition of the Company by the Victoria group in August 2018, certain corporate and
financing transactions have taken place and are considered to have a significant impact at the end of
financial year 2018 (see note 27) and therefore the results and equity of the accompanying interim
consolidated financial statements for the six months period ended June 30, 2018 are not representative of
the results that are expected for the full year 2018.

(c) Functional and presentation currency

The figures disclosed in the interim consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euros, the Parent
Company functional and presentation currency.

(d) Critical issues regarding the valuation and estimation of relevant uncertainties and judgements used
when applying accounting principles

Relevant accounting estimates and judgements and other estimates and assumptions have to be made
when applying the Group’s accounting principles to prepare the interim consolidated financial statements.
A summary of the items requiring a greater degree of judgement or which are more complex, or where the
assumptions and estimates made are significant to the preparation of the interim consolidated financial
statements, is as follows:

(i) Relevant accounting estimates and assumptions

Valuation allowances for bad debts, which require a high degree of judgement by management and a
review of individual balances based on customers’ credit ratings.

The Group makes estimates and judgements with respect to provisions for impairment of inventories
based on its own experience and historical information.

The Group estimates the useful life of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to reasonably
recognise the amortisation and depreciation of these types of assets.

The recoverability of the tax credits is based on the business projections made in the year, and on the basis
of which it is considered likely that future taxable profits will be obtained that will enable these assets to be
used.

(ii) Changes in accounting estimates

Although estimates are calculated by the Company’s directors are based on the best information available
at June 30, 2018, future events may require changes to these estimates in subsequent years. Any effect on
the interim consolidated financial statements of adjustments to be made in subsequent years would be
recognised prospectively.

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies**

(a) Subsidiary Companies

Subsidiaries are considered to be the companies, including those with a special purpose, on which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, exercises control as stated in art. 42 of
the Spanish Commercial Code. Control by means of empowerment to manage the financial and operative
policies, with the purpose of obtaining a profit from its business activities, considering to these effects, the
potential exercisable or convertible voting rights at the accounting year end in hands of the Group or
others.

To the effects of presentation and breakdown, Group Companies are considered to be those which are
controlled by any means by a sole or group of natural or legal people, which act together or are found by
the same management due to agreements or clauses.

Subsidiary companies have been consolidated using the global integration method.

Information of the subsidiary companies included in the Group consolidation can be found in Appendix I.

Revenues, expenses and cash flows of subsidiary companies are included in the interim consolidated
financial statements from the acquisition date, which is the date from which the Group effectively obtains
the control over them. Subsidiary companies are excluded from the consolidation process from the date on
which control is lost.

The transactions and balances maintained with subsidiary companies as well as the related profit or loss,
have been eliminated in the consolidation process. However, losses not externally obtained, have been
considered as an indicator of value impairment of those assets which have been transmitted.

The accounting policies of the subsidiary companies have been adapted to the Group’s accounting policies.

The financial statements of subsidiary companies used in the consolidation process are referred at the
same date and period to those of the Group.

(b) Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are recognised at the acquisition date at the proportional part of
the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries acquired prior to the
transition date were recognised at the proportional part of the equity of the subsidiaries at the date of first
consolidation. Non-controlling interests are presented in the interim consolidated balance sheet within
equity, separately from equity attributable to the Parent. Non-controlling interests’ share in profit or loss
for the period is also presented separately in the interim consolidated income statement.

The profit or loss for the year and changes in equity of the subsidiaries attributable to the Group and
non-controlling interests, after consolidation adjustments and eliminations, are determined in accordance
with the percentage ownership at year end.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The profit/loss and recognised income and expense of subsidiaries are allocated to equity attributable to
the Parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investments, even if this results in a
balance receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group and
non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.

(c) Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method for business combinations.

The acquisition date is the date on which the Group obtains control of the acquiree.

The cost of the business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the
assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any consideration
contingent on future events or compliance with certain conditions in exchange for control of the business
acquired.

The cost of a business combination excludes any payments that do not form part of the consideration given
in exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.

The costs of issuing equity and liability instruments do not form part of the cost of the business
combination, but are recognised using the measurement criteria applicable to these transactions.

The Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value.
Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are recognised at the proportionate interest in the fair value of
the net assets acquired. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present
obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured.

The income, expenses and cash flows of the acquiree are included in the interim consolidated financial
statements from the acquisition date.

The excess of the cost of the business combination, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests,
over the value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets
if the acquisition has been recognised in the individual annual accounts of the consolidated companies, or
as goodwill on consolidation if the acquisition of the business has been included in the interim
consolidated financial statements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows

(i) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows

Transactions in foreign currency have been converted into euros by applying to the amount in foreign
currency, the spot exchange rate at date on which they were performed.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency have been converted into euros by
applying the exchange rate at the year end, while non-monetary assets, valued at historical cost, have been
converted by applying the exchange rate at the date on which the transactions took place.

In the presentation of the interim consolidated statement of cash flow, the cash flows from transactions in
foreign currency, have been converted to euros by applying to the amount in foreign currency, the spot
exchange rate at the date on which they are performed.

The positive and negative differences which appear both, in the liquidation of transactions in foreign
currency, and in the conversion to euros of assets and liabilities in foreign currency, are stated in the
interim consolidated income statement.

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(ii) Conversion of businesses abroad

The conversion to euros of businesses abroad whose functional currency is not the one from a country
which suffers a hyperinflationary economy, has been performed by applying the following criteria:

- Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and the adjustments of net assets derived from the acquisition
of businesses, are converted at the exchange rate at the balance closing date.

- Revenues and expenses, are converted at the date of each transaction by the average exchange rate of
the period which finishes at the balance sheet date.

- Exchange rate differences as the result of the enforcement of the criteria previously described, are
recognized as conversion differences inside the consolidated net equity.

In the interim consolidated statement of cash flow, the cash flows coming from businesses abroad, have
been converted to euros by applying to the amount in foreign currency, the exchange rate at the date when
they are performed.

The conversion differences registered in the consolidated net equity, are stated in the interim consolidated
income statement at the date in which the disposal or disposition in another way of businesses or
companies takes place. The disposal can be produced by liquidation, reimbursement of the investment or
abandonment. The payment of a dividend represents a disposition in the sense from which it supposes a
reimbursement of the investment.

The functional currency of the subsidiary companies located abroad, is the currency from the countries in
which they are domiciled.

(e) Intangible assets

Intangible assets are measured at acquisition or production cost. Capitalised production costs are
recognised under self-constructed assets in the interim consolidated income statement. Intangible assets
are carried at cost, less any accumulated amortisation and impairment.

(i) Goodwill on consolidation

Goodwill on consolidation reflects the excess of the cost of business combination over the acquisition-date
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the acquisition.

(ii) Research and development

Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

The Group capitalises development expenses incurred by each specific project that meets the following
conditions:

- Payments attributable to the performance of the project can be measured reliably.

- The allocation, assignment and timing of costs for each project are clearly defined.

- There is evidence of the project’s technical success, in terms of direct operation or sale to a third party
of the results thereof once completed and if a market exists.

- The economic and commercial feasibility of the project is reasonably assured.

- Financing to develop the project, the availability of adequate technical and other resources to
complete the development and to use or sell the resulting intangible asset are reasonably assured.

- There is an intention to complete the intangible asset for its use or sale.

Development expenditure is reclassified under patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights at the date
of registration. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of five years.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

When there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic and commercial feasibility of
capitalised projects, the amounts in the balance sheet are recognised directly as a loss for the period.

(iii) Industrial property

Industrial property includes the cost of obtaining different patents, trademarks or similar rights and is
amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.

(iv) Computer software

Computer software acquired and produced by the Group, including website costs, is recognised when it
meets the conditions for consideration as development costs. Computer software maintenance costs are
charged as expenses when incurred. Computer software maintenance costs are amortised on a straight-line
basis over a period of four years.

(v) Subsequent costs

Subsequent costs incurred on intangible assets are recognised in the interim consolidated income
statement, unless they increase the expected future economic benefits attributable to the intangible asset.

(vi) Useful life and amortisation rates

Development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis from the date on which the project is
completed.

The depreciable amount of intangible assets is measured as the cost of the asset, less any residual value.

The Group reviews the residual value, useful life and amortisation method for intangible assets at each
year end. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.

(vii) Impairment losses

The Group measures and determines impairment to be recognised or reversed based on the criteria in
section (h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation.

(f) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Initial recognition

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of acquisition or production. Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment.

Items of property, plant and equipment recognised prior to 31 December 1996 are carried at a revalued
amount as permitted by pertinent legislation.

Spare parts used to replace similar parts in facilities, equipment and machinery are measured applying the
aforementioned criteria. Parts with a warehouse cycle of less than one year are recognised as inventories.
Parts with a warehouse cycle of more than one year and which are related to certain specific assets are
recognised and depreciated on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy for the assets in
question, and those not related to specific assets are recognised as other fixed assets and depreciated using
the same process as for the part to be replaced, if this can be identified. In general, these latter spare parts
are depreciated from the date they are incorporated into the asset, considering their technical
obsolescence and the weighted technical or economic useful life of the assets in which they are to be
incorporated.

Non-current investments in property held by the Group under operating leases are classified as property,
plant and equipment. Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful life.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(ii) Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by allocating the depreciable amount of the asset on a
systematic basis over its useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, less its residual value.
The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each component of an item of property,
plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the asset and with a useful
life that differs from the remainder of the asset.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the following criteria:

**Depreciation** **Estimated years**
**method** **of useful life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 33.33–50
Technical installations and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 5.55–10
Other installations, equipment and furniture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 3.33–10
Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 6.25
Information technology equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 4
Other property, plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 5–6.66

The Group reviews residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods at each year end. Changes to
initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.

(iii) Subsequent costs

Subsequent to initial recognition of the asset, only the costs incurred which increase capacity or
productivity or which lengthen the useful life of the asset are capitalised. The carrying amount of parts that
are replaced is derecognised. Costs of day-to-day servicing are recognised in the interim consolidated
income statement as incurred.

(iv) Impairment

The Group measures and determines impairment to be recognised or reversed based on the criteria in
section (h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation.

(g) Investment property

The Group classifies under this heading all investment property, including those in progress or under
development, which are totally or partially destined to obtain rental revenues, capital gains or both, instead
from its use in the production or supplying process of goods and services, or for administrative activities of
the Group or its disposal in the current fiscal year.

The Group recognizes and appraise investment property, following the established criteria for fixed assets.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

Depreciation of Investment property is determined by the application of the criteria mentioned below:

**Depreciation** **Estimated years**
**method** **of useful life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 30–50

(h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation

At least at the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its
non-current assets or cash-generating units may be impaired. If any such indication exists, it estimates the
recoverable amounts of these items.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An asset is impaired
when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the expected
future cash flows, discounted at a risk-free market interest rate and adjusted for any risks specific to the
asset. For assets which do not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets
or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating units to which these
assets belong.

Impairment losses are recognised in the interim consolidated income statement.

(i) Leases

(i) Lessee accounting

Leases in which, upon inception, the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership are classified as finance leases, otherwise they are classified as operating leases.

- _Finance leases_

At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognises finance leases as assets and liabilities at the
lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial
direct costs are added to the asset’s carrying amount. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Interest is expensed using the effective
interest method.

Contingent rents are recognised as an expense when it is probable that they will be incurred.

The accounting policies applied to the assets used by the Group by virtue of finance lease contracts are the
same as those set out in section (f). However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term, the assets are fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term
and their useful lives.

- _Operating leases_

Lease payments under an operating lease, net of incentives received, are recognised as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time
pattern of the lease’s benefit.

Contingent rents are recognised as an expense when it is probable that they will be incurred.

(j) Financial instruments

(i) Classification and separation of financial instruments

Financial instruments are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an
equity instrument in accordance with the economic substance of the contractual arrangement and the
definitions of a financial asset, a financial liability and an equity instrument.

F-315

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Group classifies financial instruments into different categories based on the nature of the instruments
and the Group’s intentions on initial recognition.

(ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables comprise trade and non-trade receivables with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market other than those classified in other financial asset categories. These
assets are initially recognised at fair value, including transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Nevertheless, financial assets which have no established interest rate, which mature or are expected to be
received in the short term, and for which the effect of discounting is immaterial, are measured at their
nominal amount.

The Group measures loans and receivables at amortised cost provided that reliable cash flow estimates can
be made based on contractual terms.

(iii) Interest and dividends

Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.

Dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised when the Group is entitled to receive
them. If the dividends are clearly derived from profits generated prior to the acquisition date because
amounts higher than the profits generated by the investment since acquisition have been distributed, the
carrying amount of the investment is reduced.

(iv) Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the
sum of the consideration received, net of transaction costs, including any new asset obtained less any new
liability assumed and any cumulative gain or loss deferred in recognised income and expense, is recorded
in interim consolidated income statement.

(v) Investments in group companies excluded from the scope of consolidation

Investments in group companies are initially recognized at cost, which is equivalent to the fair value of the
consideration paid, and are subsequently valued at cost, less the accumulated amount of impairment
losses. Investments in group companies acquired prior to 1 January 2010 include the transaction costs
incurred in the cost of acquisition.

(vi) Impairment of financial assets

A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset and the event or events have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

The Group recognises impairment of loans and receivables and debt instruments when estimated future
cash flows are reduced or delayed due to debtor insolvency.

Impairment of financial assets carried at amortised cost

The amount of the impairment loss of financial assets carried at amortised cost is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. For variable income financial assets, the effective interest rate corresponding to the
measurement date under the contractual conditions is used.

The impairment loss is recognised in interim consolidated income statement and may be reversed in
subsequent periods if the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment
has been recognised. The loss can only be reversed to the limit of the amortised cost of the assets had the
impairment loss not been recognised.

(vii) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, that are not classified as held for trading or as
financial liabilities at fair value through the interim consolidated income statement are initially recognised
at fair value less any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. After initial
recognition, liabilities classified under this category are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Nevertheless, financial liabilities which have no established interest rate, which mature or are expected to
be settled in the short term, and for which the effect of discounting is immaterial, are measured at their
nominal amount.

The Group measures financial liabilities at amortised cost provided that reliable estimates of cash flows
can be made based on the contractual terms.

(viii)Reverse factoring

The Group has contracted reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage
payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are
recognised under trade and other payables in the balance sheet until they are settled, repaid or have
expired.

(ix) Security deposits

Security deposits paid are measured using the same criteria as for financial assets.

(x) Derecognition and modifications of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises all or part of a financial liability when it either discharges the liability by paying
the creditor, or is legally released from primary responsibility for the liability either by process of law or by
the creditor.

The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability, or part of a financial liability,
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the interim consolidated income statement. If the Group
transfers non-monetary assets in settlement of the debt, the difference between their fair value and their
carrying amount is recognised as results from operating activities, and the difference between the value of
the debt being settled and the fair value of the assets as net finance income/cost. If the Group transfers
inventories, the corresponding sale transaction is recognised at their fair value and the change in
inventories at their carrying amount.

(k) Inventories

(i) General

Inventories are initially measured at cost of purchase or production.

F-317

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The purchase price comprises the amount invoiced by the seller, after deduction of any discounts, rebates
or other similar items, such as interest incorporated into the nominal amount, plus any additional costs
incurred to bring the goods to a saleable condition and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition
and indirect taxes not recoverable from the Spanish taxation authorities.

Trade discounts are recognised as a reduction in the cost of inventories when it is probable that the
conditions for discounts to be received will be met. Unallocated discounts are recognised as a decrease on
the purchase.

Purchase returns are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of inventories returned, except
where it is not feasible to identify these items, in which case they are accounted for as a reduction in
inventories.

Sales returns are recognised at purchase price or cost of production, except where the net realisable value
is lower, in which case they are recognised at that amount.

The production cost of inventories comprises the purchase price of raw materials and consumables, costs
directly related to the units of production and systematic allocation of fixed and variable production
overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. The allocation of fixed indirect
overheads is based on the higher of normal production capacity or actual production.

Advances on account of inventories are measured at cost.

The cost of raw materials, other supplies and merchandise is allocated to each inventory unit on a weighted
average cost basis.

When the cost of inventories exceeds net realisable value, materials are written down to net realisable
value. For these purposes, net realisable value is understood as follows:

- For raw materials and other supplies, replacement cost. Raw materials and other supplies are not
written down below cost if the finished goods in which they will be incorporated are expected to be
sold at or above cost of production;

- For merchandise and finished goods, estimated selling price less costs to sell;

- For work in progress, estimated selling price of the related finished goods, less the estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale;

The previously recognised write-down is reversed against the interim consolidated income statement when
the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down no longer exist or when there is
clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances. The
reversal of the valuation adjustment is limited to the lower of the cost and the revised net realisable value
of the inventories.

Write-downs to net realisable value recognised or reversed on inventories are classified under changes in
inventories of finished goods and work in progress or supplies, depending on their nature.

(ii) Emission allowances

Emission allowances, which are recognised when the Group becomes entitled to such allowances, are
measured at cost of acquisition or production under raw materials and other supplies. Emission allowances
which are expected to be consumed within a period of more than one year are recognised under raw
materials and other supplies—long cycle. Emission allowances acquired through an onerous contract are
accounted for by applying the same criteria as for inventories. Allowances acquired free of charge, or, at a
price substantially lower than fair value, are carried at fair value. Any difference between fair value and the
consideration given is recognised as a non-refundable grant associated with the emission allowances and
credited to equity. These grants are recognised as income and matched with the associated costs which the
grants are intended to compensate, using the same criteria as for capital grants.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

Emission allowances deriving from a certified emission reduction or an emission reduction unit, generated
through clean development mechanisms or joint implementation projects, are carried at cost of
production.

Provision is systematically made under current provisions for liabilities and charges for expenses related to
the emission of greenhouse gases. This provision is maintained until the obligation is cancelled, through
the conveyance of the corresponding allowances. Provisions released or surplus provisions reversed are
recognised as operating income. The provision is determined on the basis that it will be cancelled, as
follows:

- Firstly, through allocated emission allowances, which are then used to cancel actual emissions in
proportion to total forecast emissions for the entire period to which they have been allocated. The
expense corresponding to this part of the obligation is determined based on the carrying amount of
the transferred emission allowances;

- Secondly, through the remaining emission allowances recorded. Expenditure on this part of the
obligation is measured as the weighted average cost of the emission allowances.

If the emission of gases necessitates the acquisition or production of emission allowances because
actual emissions exceed those which can be cancelled through the allocated emission allowances, or
through surplus emission allowances, whether acquired or produced. Provision is made for the
shortfall in allowances. The expense is determined using the best estimate of the amount necessary to
cover the shortfall in emission allowances.

(l) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits in financial institutions. They also
include other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualifies as a
cash equivalent when it has a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.

The Group recognises cash payments and receipts for financial assets and financial liabilities in which
turnover is quick on a net basis in the statement of cash flows. Turnover is considered to be quick when the
period between the date of acquisition and maturity does not exceed six months.

(m) Grants, donations and bequests

Grants are recorded in recognised income and expense when, where applicable, they have been officially
awarded, the conditions attached to them have been met or there is reasonable assurance that they will be
received.

Monetary grants are measured at the fair value of the sum received, whilst non-monetary grants received
are accounted for at the fair value of the asset received.

In subsequent years, grants are recognised as income as they are applied.

Capital grants are recognised as income over the same period and in the proportions in which depreciation
on those assets is charged or when the assets are disposed of, derecognised or impaired.

Grants awarded to finance specific expenses are recognised as income when the financed expenses are
accrued.

(n) Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal, contractual, constructive or
tacit) as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

If it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle an obligation, the provision is
reversed.

(o) Revenue from the sale of goods and rendering of services

Revenue from the sale of goods or services is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. Volume rebates, prompt payment and any other discounts, as well as the interest added to the
nominal amount of the consideration, are recognised as a reduction in the consideration.

Discounts granted to customers are recognised as a reduction in sales revenue when it is probable that the
discount conditions will be met.

Advances on account of future sales are measured at the value received.

(i) Revenue from sales

The Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods when:

- It has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;

- It retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership
nor effective control over the goods sold;

- The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably;

- It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and

- The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

(p) Income tax

The income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.

Current tax assets or liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as income or an expense and included in the interim consolidated
income statement for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is
recognised, in the same or a different year, directly in equity, or from a business combination.

The Company files consolidated tax returns with Obinesa, S.L. (Parent) and other Group companies until
2017.

In addition to the factors to be considered for individual taxation, set out previously, the following factors
were taken into account when determining the accrued income tax expense for the companies which
formed the consolidated tax group:

- Temporary and permanent differences which arose from the elimination of profits and losses on
transactions between Group companies, derived from the process of determining consolidated taxable
income.

- Deductions and credits corresponding to each company which formed the consolidated tax group. For
these purposes, deductions and credits were allocated to the company that carried out the activity or
obtained the profit necessary to obtain the right to the deduction or tax credit.

Temporary differences which arose from the elimination of profits and losses on transactions between tax
group companies were allocated to the company which recognised the profit/loss and are were valued using
the tax rate of that company.

**Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

A reciprocal credit and debit which arose between the companies that contribute tax losses to the
consolidated Group and the rest of the companies that offset those losses. Where a tax loss cannot be
offset by the other consolidated Group companies, these tax credits for loss carry forwards were recognised
as deferred tax assets using the applicable recognition criteria, considering the tax group as a taxable entity.

The Parent of the Tax Group recorded the total consolidated income tax payable (recoverable) with a debit
(credit) to receivables (payables) from/to Group companies and associates.

The amount of the debt (credit) relating to the subsidiaries was recognised with a credit (debit) to payables
(receivables) to/from Group companies and associates.

(i) Recognition of deferred tax liabilities

The Group recognises deferred tax liabilities in all cases except:

- where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor
taxable income;

- where they correspond to taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries,
associates and jointly-controlled entities over which the Group has the ability to control the moment
of its reversal and it is not probable that its reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

(ii) Recognition of deferred tax assets

The Group recognises deferred tax assets provided that:

- it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available against which they can be utilised or when
tax legislation envisages the possibility of converting deferred tax assets into a receivable from public
entities in the future. However, the assets arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a
transaction that is not a business combination and at the date of the transaction do not affect either
the accounting result or the taxable income, are not recognized;

- they correspond to deductible temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates
and jointly-controlled entities, to the extent that the temporary differences will revert in the
foreseeable future and it is expected to generate future tax profits in order to offset the differences.

The Group recognises the payment obligation deriving from financial contributions as an operating
expense with a credit to payables to public entities when it is accrued in accordance with the Spanish
Income Tax Law.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is not considered probable that the Group will have future
taxable profit when the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered in a period of more than ten years
from the end of the reporting period, irrespective of the nature of the deferred tax asset; or, in the case of
tax credits for deductions and other tax relief that are unused due to an insufficient amount of total tax,
when there is reasonable doubt—after the activity or the income giving rise to entitlement to the deduction
or tax credit has been rendered or received, respectively—as to whether the requirements for their offset
will be met.

The Group only recognises deferred tax assets arising from tax loss carry forwards when it is probable that
future taxable profit will be generated against which they may be offset within the period stipulated in
applicable tax legislation, up to a maximum period of ten years, unless there is evidence that their recovery
in a longer period of time is probable and tax legislation provides for their utilisation in a longer period or
stipulates no time limit for their utilisation.

Conversely, it is considered probable that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profit to recover
deferred tax assets when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation
authority and the same taxable entity, which are expected to reverse in the same tax period as the expected

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

reversal of the deductible temporary differences or in periods into which a tax loss arising from a
deductible temporary difference can be carried back or forward.

The Group recognises deferred tax assets not previously recognised because they were not expected to be
utilised within the ten-year recovery period, inasmuch as the future reversal period does not exceed ten
years from the end of the reporting period or when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences.

(iii) Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the years
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted
or substantially enacted. The tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group
expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets or liabilities are also reflected in the
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

(iv) Classification

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the interim consolidated balance sheet under
non-current assets or liabilities, irrespective of the expected date of recovery or settlement.

(q) Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current

Assets and liabilities are classified as current and non-current based on the Group’s normal operating
cycle, which is no more than twelve months.

(r) Environmental issues

The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its
activities.

Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as other operating expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. Nonetheless, the Group recognises environmental provisions and, where
applicable, reimbursement rights by applying the general criteria described in the section on provisions.

Property, plant and equipment acquired by the Group for long-term use to minimise the environmental
impact of its activity and protect and improve the environment, including the reduction and elimination of
future pollution from the Group’s activities, are recognised as assets applying the measurement,
presentation and disclosure criteria described in section (f) Property, plant and equipment.

(s) Transactions between Mosaiq Group companies excluded from the consolidation group

Transactions between Mosaiq Group companies excluded from the consolidation group, except those
related to mergers, spin-offs and non-monetary contributions, are recognised at the fair value of the
consideration given or received. The difference between this value and the amount agreed is recognised in
line with the underlying economic substance of the transaction.

**(6) Goodwill, Goodwill from Consolidated Companies and Value Impairment**

Goodwill on consolidation arises as the consequence of the existent excess, between the cost of business
combination derived from the acquisition by the Group of the 99,89% of the shares of the subsidiary
company Atlantic Tiles, and the corresponding identifiable net assets’ value of the acquiree.

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the net book value of the goodwill on consolidation is zero,
having recorded an impairment for an amount of Euros 266,000 in 2017.

During 2017 and 2016, the Group has impaired the Goodwill arising from the business combination after
evaluating the negative evolution of the business, sales and results, and the future forecasts that do not
contemplate the recovery of the mentioned asset.

**(7) Property, Plant and Equipment**

Details of property, plant and equipment and movements are shown in Appendix II.

(a) General

The net amount pending depreciation of property, plant and equipment from the increased value recorded
in 1996 in accordance with Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of 7 June 1996, amounts to Euros 259.386 and
Euros 270.996 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

(b) Property, plant and equipment acquired from Group companies

Property, plant and equipment acquired from Mosaiq Group companies at June 30, 2018 mainly reflect
land and buildings with a carrying amount of Euros 3,839,872 (Euros 3,933,074 at December 31, 2017) and
other installations, furniture and fixtures of Euros 333,137 (Euros 369,184 at December 31, 2017).

**(11) Risk Management Policy**

(a) Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s
global risk management programme focuses on uncertainty in the financial markets and aims to minimise
potential adverse effects on the Group’s profits.

During the six months period ended June 30, 2018 and during 2017 risks were managed by the Finance
Management of the Mosaiq Group. This Management identifies, evaluates and mitigates financial risks in
close collaboration with the Group’s operational units. Since the acquisition mentioned in note 27 risks are
managed by the Victoria Group.

(i) Currency risk

Currency risk is the risk of possible losses due to changes in the fair value of and cash flows from financial
instruments as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. The Group’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
arises mainly from sales performed, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency.

The Group makes sales in Euros, US Dollars and Pounds Sterling.

The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency.

(ii) Credit risk

The Group has policies to limit the amount of risk with any one financial institution and manages its
customer portfolio adequately.

Valuation allowances for bad debts and the review of individual balances based on customers’ credit ratings
require a high degree of judgement. The credit rating of the country, based on information provided by
external agencies, is used to calculate the individual country-specific valuation allowance for bad debts.

The Group has set up an on-line consultation service with a specialised agency to assess customers’ credit
risk.

The Group has also contracted several credit insurance policies to cover export and domestic sales, which
cover at a coverage rate between 95% and 85%, respectively, on the credit limits approved by insurance
companies.

**Six months period ended June 30, 2018**

**(11) Risk Management Policy (Continued)**

For uninsured customers, the Group may grant credit limits in cases or circumstances where it considers
appropriate.

(iii) Liquidity risk

The Group applies a prudent policy to cover its liquidity risks based on having sufficient cash and
marketable securities, as well as sufficient financing through credit facilities, to settle market positions. The
management of the Group regularly monitors liquidity forecasts based on expected cash flows. Group
policy is to invest cash surpluses in short-term, non-speculative and highly liquid instruments, through
leading financial institutions.

(iv) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks

Income and cash flows from the Group’s operating activities are not significantly affected by fluctuations in
market interest rates.

Interest rate risk arises mainly from non-current borrowings.

**(15) Equity (Continued)**

shareholder approved the distribution of an additional dividend in kind with a charge to voluntary reserves
of Euros 16,157,446 and a dividend on account of profits for 2017 of Euros 17,345,622.

The amount of the dividend on account distributed does not exceed the amount of profits obtained since
the end of the previous year, less the amounts that should be allocated to mandatory or statutory reserves,
prior years’ losses, and the estimated income tax payable for these profits.

These distributions of dividends were carried out by offsetting balances receivable from a current account
with the Mosaiq Group companies by the aforementioned amounts. As the distribution of the dividend on
account of 2017 profits is in kind, comprising a receivable, it does not affect the liquidity of the Parent
Company. These distributions of dividends were carried out by virtue of the agreements to offset and
eliminate balances and transactions with the Mosaiq Group companies set out in the Framework
Refinancing Agreement entered into in 2017.

(d) Dividend restrictions

There were certain restrictions to the distribution of dividends, in accordance with the Framework
Refinancing Agreement entered into on August 8, 2017.

(e) Conversion differences

The conversion differences amounting to Euros 112,431 at June 30, 2018 (Euros 111,709 in 2017)

**(16) Grants, donations and bequests received**

At June 30, 2018 the Group has capital grants with a net amount of Euros 204,172 (Euros 111,665 at

joint guarantor, together with certain Mosaiq Group companies, of the balances payable on the revolving
credit facilities extended by financial institutions for a total amount of Euros 93.3 million at June 30, 2018
(Euros 96.3 million at December 31, 2017), included in the new Framework Refinancing Agreement. The

At December 31, 2017 other payables to Group companies mainly comprised payables arising from the tax
effect of filing consolidated tax returns. This balance was payable to Obinesa, S.L., the head of the tax
group. At June 30, 2018 other payables to Group companies mainly corresponded to unpaid balances
related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.

Payables non-current and current included the balance amount at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 of
the loan granted by an affiliated company of the Atiltan Group (Balaenoptera Borealis Loans, S.L.U.). In
the context of the arrival of Atitlan Group (see note 1) and the Group’s Refinancing Contract (see
note 19.c), a participating loan of Euros 50 million was arranged on December 18, 2017. The initial term of
the loan was two years, which may be extended up to five years. Nevertheless, it must remain in force and
will be understood to be automatically extended for the outstanding balance until working capital funding
has been repaid under the terms of the Framework Refinancing Agreement. This loan accrued fixed
interest tied to Euribor plus a spread, and variable interest linked to the Company’s EBITDA.
Furthermore, a minimum amount of accrued interest and a maximum amount of interest payments were
stipulated for the first two years in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Refinancing
Agreement. The borrower has undertaken to use the proceeds from the loan for the partial repayment of
the initial debt of the Mosaiq Group under the terms stipulated in the Framework Refinancing Agreement.
As mentioned in note 27, this loan and its accrued interest has been repaid by the Victoria Group.

(c) Other information on payables

(i) Main characteristics of payables

On August 8, 2017 the Mosaiq Group formalised a new Framework Refinancing Agreement with a
syndicate of financial institutions in order to restructure its financial debt, aligning it with its short- and
medium-term financing needs, and to pave the way for the arrival of a new investor to the Mosaiq Group.
As part of the renegotiation of its financial debt, Mosaiq Group management approved a new Business
Plan which was drawn up in collaboration with independent experts and which will ensure the survival and
stability of the Mosaiq Group’s activity in the short, medium and long-term.

The Framework Refinancing Agreement was signed by a number of financial institutions representing over
80% of the Group’s financial debt, and the Mosaiq Group therefore applied for a court-sanctioned
workout to make the terms of the Framework Refinancing Agreement applicable to non-signatory
institutions. On September 15, 2017 the Mosaiq Group filed an application with the Castell´on Commercial
Court for a court-sanctioned workout of the Framework Refinancing Agreement. On October 11, 2017 the
Castell´on Commercial Court issued an injunction extending the financial restructuring agreement for all
intents and purposes to the institutions that had not subscribed the agreement. The injunction for the
court-sanctioned workout was published in the Official State Gazette on October 17, 2017. Once the
period of 15 business days following the publication in the Official State Gazette has elapsed without the
creditors affected by the court-sanctioned workout that have not subscribed the financial restructuring
agreement impugning the court injunction, the court-sanctioned workout should be considered final.

The conclusion of the aforementioned court-sanctioned workout forms part of the condition precedent
established in the Framework Refinancing Agreement. The rest of the terms of the condition precedent of
the Framework Refinancing Agreement were considered to have been met on December 18, 2017, the date
on which the Refinancing Agreement went into effect.

**(19) Payables and Trade and other payables (Continued)**

The main terms of the Refinancing Agreement are as follows:

- On entry into force of the Refinancing Agreement, the Mosaiq Group paid the creditor financial
institutions that signed the Agreement Euros 58 million as partial repayment of its financial debt. For
the remaining debt, which amounted to Euros 413 million, not including revolving credit facilities or
ring-fenced property, debt amounting to Euros 8 million was novated along with the associated
conditions. The financial institutions granted a waiver for the entire outstanding balance of Euros
346 million, which was recognised as finance income in the Mosaiq Group consolidated income
statement. At December 31, 2017, the novated debt was partially repaid, leaving an outstanding
balance at December 31, 2017 of Euros 697 thousand, Euros 692 thousand at June 30, 2018.

- The Refinancing Agreement stipulates that the financial institutions must maintain the current limits
on the revolving credit facilities granted to certain Group companies for a three-year period.

- The Refinancing Agreement, once the debt has been partially repaid, cancels all mortgage and
personal guarantees and pledged assets related to Mosaiq Group’s initial debt granted to ensure
fulfilment of the obligations of any Mosaiq Group company under the previous refinancing
agreements.

- In addition, it stipulates that the Mosaiq Group must fulfil certain formal obligations vis-`a-vis the
creditor entities, as well as certain financial ratios or covenants for the years ended on or after
December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the Refinancing Agreement does not require compliance
with covenants.

Following the signing of the aforementioned Framework Agreement, the Group recognised in the second
half of 2017 a finance income amounting to Euros 22,016 thousand for the debt waiver granted to the
Company by the financial institutions.

The Group has the following credit facilities and discount lines at 31 December:

At December 31, 2017 as provided in the aforementioned Framework Refinancing Agreement, certain
Mosaiq Group companies had a joint revolving credit facility of up to Euros 17.4 million to finance their
sales. At December 31, 2017 the amount drawn down by these companies totals Euros 7.8 million. At
June 30, 2018 the amount is zero euros.

Loans and borrowings accrue interest at market rates.

Nonetheless, the taxation authorities’ right to examine or investigate tax loss carry forwards (whether
available or already offset), double taxation relief and tax credits aimed at incentivising certain activities
(whether applied or available) becomes statute-barred ten years as from the day after the filing deadline
for the tax return or self-assessment for the tax period in which the right of offset or application was
generated. After this period, the Group must justify the tax loss carry forwards or tax credits by presenting
the assessment or self-assessment and its accounts, together with evidence of their having been filed during
the aforementioned period at the Mercantile Registry.

Due to different possible interpretations of prevailing tax legislation, additional tax liabilities could arise in
the event of inspection. In any event, any such liabilities that could arise are not expected to have a
significant effect on the interim consolidated financial statements.

**Independent Auditors’ Report in accordance with International Standards on Auditing on the**
**Consolidated Financial Statements**

To the Sole Shareholder of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U.

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. (the ‘‘Company’’) and
its subsidiaries (together the ‘‘Group’’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31,
2017, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give, in all material respects, a true
and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2017, and of its
consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the Spanish General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1514/2007 and the Rules for the
Preparation of Consolidated Annual Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1159/2010 and subsequent
amendments.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of
_the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance the IESBA Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Other matter**

As mentioned in note 2, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been prepared to
comply with legal requirements in Spain but in relation to a possible bond issuance to be carried out by the
ultimate shareholder of the Group and have been audited in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing. In this regard, statutory consolidated annual accounts as at December 31, 2016 were neither
prepared nor audited as they did not meet the requirements established by prevailing legislation.
Consequently, the corresponding figures included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
are identified as ‘‘unaudited’’. Under no circumstances may this report be considered an audit report in the
terms provided in prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain.

**Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give
a true and fair view in accordance with the Spanish General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree
1514/2007 and the Rules for the Preparation of Consolidated Annual Accounts, and for such internal
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report
that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease
to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements, represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. regarding, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**December 31, 2017**

**(1) Nature and Activities of the Company and Composition of the Group**

Cer´amica Saloni, S.A U. (hereinafter the Company or Parent Company) (together with its subsidiaries, the
Group) was incorporated with limited liability under Spanish law on 27 November 1971. Its statutory and
principal activity consists of the development, manufacture, finance, import, export, trading, exhibition,
purchase and sale of all types of ceramic and construction materials and products and bathroom and
kitchen furniture and accessories.

The Company operates throughout Spain and in several other countries through its factory in San Juan de
Mor´o (Castell´on) and subsidiaries in Portugal, the UK and France. In 2016 the Parent Company acquired
the trading company Atlantic Tiles. The Company also carries out its activity through a network of stores
in Spain. Its registered office is located at Carretera de Castell´on a Alcora, km. 17, San Juan de Mor´o
(Castell´on).

At December 31, 2017 the Company formed part of the Mosaiq Group, (previously named Obinesa
Group), the parent of which is Obinesa, S.L. The Company’s direct parent was Obinesa Grupo Industrial,
S.L.U. Both companies are domiciled in Castell´on. The directors of Obinesa, S.L. have prepared statutory
consolidated annual accounts for 2017 within the legally established period, which are to be filed at the
Castell´on Mercantile Registry.

In turn, since December 2017 the Mosaiq Group formed part of the Atitlan Group, which is domiciled in
Valencia. The statutory consolidated annual accounts of the Atitlan Group which are to be filed at the
Valencia Mercantile Registry. At December 31, 2017 the Company was wholly owned by its sole
shareholder is Obinesa Grupo Industrial, S.L.U.

On August 7, 2018, Victoria PLC, through an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary named Sandover
Investments, S.L.U., acquired the entire share capital of Cer´amica Saloni S.A.U. (see note 28).)

The Company holds investments in subsidiaries. Details of investments in subsidiaries are provided in
Appendix I. All subsidiaries have been consolidated. No investees are listed on any stock exchange market.

During 2017 there has not been changes in the perimeter of consolidation. During 2016 the most
significant changes in the perimeter of consolidation were the following:

- Exit from the perimeter of consolidation due to liquidation of the subsidiary Saloni Service S.R.L.

- Entry into the perimeter of consolidation of the subsidiary Atlantic Tiles, S.L.

**(2) Basis of Presentation**

(a) True and fair view

The directors have authorised the 2017 consolidated financial statements for issue and the consolidated
financial statements for 2017 have been prepared in accordance with prevailing legislation, the Spanish
General Chart of Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1514/2007 and the Rules for the Preparation of
Consolidated Annual Accounts approved by Royal Decree 1159/2010 and subsequent amendments to give
a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position at December 31, 2017
and consolidated results of operations, consolidated changes in equity, and consolidated cash flows for the
year then ended.

In accordance with prevailing legislation, the Company is the parent of a group of companies. In
accordance with financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, consolidated financial
statements must be prepared to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group, the results
of operations and changes in its equity and cash flows. Nevertheless, as permitted by section 2 of article 43
of the Spanish Code of Commerce, the Company does not prepare statutory consolidated annual accounts
as they are a subgroup of Mosaiq Group mentioned in note 1, who file statutory consolidated annual
accounts in Spain.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(2) Basis of Presentation (Continued)**

Consequently, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been prepared to comply with
legal requirements in Spain, but in relation to a possible bond issuance process to be carried out by the
ultimate shareholder of the Group.

(b) Comparative information

As mentioned in note 1, the Group was integrated in the Mosaiq Group, a higher-level Spanish group,
meaning that the Parent Company is not obliged to present statutory consolidated annual accounts as
provided in section 2 of article 43 of the Commercial Code, as the Mosaiq Group filed statutory
consolidated annual accounts. However, according to note 2.a), 2017 is the first year in which the Group
has voluntarily prepared consolidated financial statements. As a consequence, the acquisition date of the
consolidated companies, to the effect of applying the consolidation method, must be referred to the
acquisition/constitution date in the Mosaiq Group to which they belonged at December 31, 2017.

The consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in
equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes thereto for 2017 include unaudited
corresponding figures for 2016.

(c) Functional and presentation currency

The figures disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are expressed in Euros, the Parent Company
functional and presentation currency.

(d) Critical issues regarding the valuation and estimation of relevant uncertainties and judgements used
when applying accounting principles

Relevant accounting estimates and judgements and other estimates and assumptions have to be made
when applying the Group’s accounting principles to prepare the consolidated financial statements. A
summary of the items requiring a greater degree of judgement or which are more complex, or where the
assumptions and estimates made are significant to the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements, is as follows:

(i) Relevant accounting estimates and assumptions

Valuation allowances for bad debts, which require a high degree of judgement by management and a
review of individual balances based on customers’ credit ratings.

The Group makes estimates and judgements with respect to provisions for impairment of inventories
based on its own experience and historical information.

The Group estimates the useful life of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to reasonably
recognise the amortisation and depreciation of these types of assets.

The recoverability of the tax credits is based on the business projections made in the year, and on the basis
of which it is considered likely that future taxable profits will be obtained that will enable these assets to be
used.

(ii) Changes in accounting estimates

Although estimates are calculated by the Company’s directors based on the best information available at
December 31, 2017, future events may require changes to these estimates in subsequent years. Any effect
on the consolidated financial statements of adjustments to be made in subsequent years would be
recognised prospectively.

**(2) Basis of Presentation (Continued)**

(e) Financial situation

In previous years, in view of the on-going financial crisis, the Group prepared a business plan which
considered significant cost-cutting measures to adapt the Group’s structure to the actual level of demand.
This, together with the marketing initiatives carried out, has enabled the Group to increase its sales in
2017, and obtain operating and net profits in both 2016 and 2017.

At December 31, 2017 the Group also shows a balanced equity structure, with net equity of Euros
9,460 thousand, which has decreased because of the distribution of dividends of Euros 50,942 thousand at
the end of 2017, by virtue of the agreement to net and eliminate balances and transactions with the Mosaiq
Group companies set out in the Framework Refinancing Agreement signed in 2017 (see note 20.c). At
December 31, 2017 the Group’s working capital is positive in an amount of Euros 21,451 thousand.

**(3) Distribution of Profit**

The distribution of the Parent’s profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, proposed by the directors
and approved by the decision of the Sole Shareholder as of December 18, 2017, consisted of its transfer to
voluntary reserves.

The distribution of the Parent’s 2017 profit approved by the sole shareholder on June 30, 2018 is as follows:

**In Euros**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies**

(a) Subsidiary Companies

Subsidiaries are considered to be the companies, including those with a special purpose, on which the
Parent Company, directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, exercises control as stated in art. 42 of
the Spanish Commercial Code. Control by means of empowerment to manage the financial and operative
policies, with the purpose of obtaining a profit from its business activities, considering to these effects, the
potential exercisable or convertible voting rights at the accounting year end in hands of the Group or
others.

To the effects of presentation and breakdown, Group Companies are considered to be those which are
controlled by any means by a sole or group of natural or legal people, which act together or are found by
the same management due to agreements or clauses.

Subsidiary companies have been consolidated using the global integration method.

Information of the subsidiary companies included in the consolidation Group can be found in Appendix I.

Revenues, expenses and cashflows of subsidiary companies are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the acquisition date, which is the date from which the Group effectively obtains the
control over them. Subsidiary companies are excluded from the consolidation process from the date on
which control is lost.

The transactions and balances maintained with subsidiary companies as well as the related profit or loss,
have been eliminated in the consolidation process. However, losses not externally obtained, have been
considered as an indicator of value impairment of those assets which have been transmitted.

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The accounting policies of the subsidiary companies have been adapted to the Group’s accounting policies.

The financial statements of subsidiary companies used in the consolidation process are referred at the
same date and period to those of the Group.

(b) Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are recognised at the acquisition date at the proportional part of
the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries acquired prior to the
transition date were recognised at the proportional part of the equity of the subsidiaries at the date of first
consolidation. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity,
separately from equity attributable to the Parent. Non-controlling interests’ share in profit or loss for the
year is also presented separately in the consolidated income statement.

The profit or loss for the year and changes in equity of the subsidiaries attributable to the Group and
non-controlling interests, after consolidation adjustments and eliminations, are determined in accordance
with the percentage ownership at year end.

The profit/loss and recognised income and expense of subsidiaries are allocated to equity attributable to
the Parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investments, even if this results in a
balance receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group and
non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.

(c) Business combinations

The Group applies the acquisition method for business combinations.

The acquisition date is the date on which the Group obtains control of the acquiree.

The cost of the business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the
assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any consideration
contingent on future events or compliance with certain conditions in exchange for control of the business
acquired.

The cost of a business combination excludes any payments that do not form part of the consideration given
in exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.

The costs of issuing equity and liability instruments do not form part of the cost of the business
combination, but are recognised using the measurement criteria applicable to these transactions.

The Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value.
Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are recognised at the proportionate interest in the fair value of
the net assets acquired. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present
obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured.

The income, expenses and cash flows of the acquiree are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the acquisition date.

The excess of the cost of the business combination, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests,
over the value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recognised as goodwill under intangible assets
if the acquisition has been recognised in the individual annual accounts of the consolidated companies, or
as goodwill on consolidation if the acquisition of the business has been included in the consolidated
financial statements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows

(i) Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows

Transactions in foreign currency have been converted into euros by applying to the amount in foreign
currency, the spot exchange rate at date on which they were performed.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency have been converted into euros by
applying the exchange rate at the year end, while non-monetary assets, valued at historical cost, have been
converted by applying the exchange rate at the date on which the transactions took place.

In the presentation of the consolidated statement of cashflow, the cashflows from transactions in foreign
currency, have been converted to euros by applying to the amount in foreign currency, the spot exchange
rate at the date on which they are performed.

The positive and negative differences which appear both, in the liquidation of transactions in foreign
currency, and in the conversion to euros of assets and liabilities in foreign currency, are stated in the
consolidated income statement.

(ii) Conversion of businesses abroad

The conversion to euros of businesses abroad whose functional currency is not the one from a country
which suffers a hyperinflationary economy, has been performed by applying the following criteria:

- Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and the adjustments of net assets derived from the acquisition
of businesses, are converted at the exchange rate at the balance closing date.

- Revenues and expenses, are converted at the date of each transaction by the average exchange rate of
the annual period which finishes at December 31.

- Exchange rate differences as the result of the enforcement of the criteria previously described, are
recognized as conversion differences inside the consolidated net equity.

In the consolidated statement of cash flow, the cashflows coming from businesses abroad, have been
converted to euros by applying to the amount in foreign currency, the exchange rate at the date when they
are performed.

The conversion differences registered in the consolidated net equity, are stated in the consolidated income
statement at the date in which the disposal or disposition in another way of businesses or companies takes
place. The disposal can be produced by liquidation, reimbursement of the investment or abandonment.
The payment of a dividend represents a disposition in the sense from which it supposes a reimbursement of
the investment.

The functional currency of the subsidiary companies located abroad, is the currency from the countries in
which they are domiciled.

(e) Intangible assets

Intangible assets are measured at acquisition or production cost. Capitalised production costs are
recognised under self-constructed assets in the consolidated income statement. Intangible assets are
carried at cost, less any accumulated amortisation and impairment.

(i) Goodwill on consolidation

Goodwill on consolidation of business combinations reflects the excess of the cost of business combination
over the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed
in the acquisition.

(ii) Research and development

Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Group capitalises development expenses incurred by each specific project that meets the following
conditions:

- Payments attributable to the performance of the project can be measured reliably.

- The allocation, assignment and timing of costs for each project are clearly defined.

- There is evidence of the project’s technical success, in terms of direct operation or sale to a third party
of the results thereof once completed and if a market exists.

- The economic and commercial feasibility of the project is reasonably assured.

- Financing to develop the project, the availability of adequate technical and other resources to
complete the development and to use or sell the resulting intangible asset are reasonably assured.

- There is an intention to complete the intangible asset for its use or sale.

Development expenditure is reclassified under patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights at the date
of registration. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of five years.

When there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic and commercial feasibility of
capitalised projects, the amounts in the balance sheet are recognised directly as a loss for the year.

(iii) Industrial property

Industrial property includes the cost of obtaining different patents, trademarks or similar rights and is
amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.

(iv) Computer software

Computer software acquired and produced by the Group, including website costs, is recognised when it
meets the conditions for consideration as development costs. Computer software maintenance costs are
charged as expenses when incurred. Computer software maintenance costs are amortised on a straight-line
basis over a period of four years.

(v) Subsequent costs

Subsequent costs incurred on intangible assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless
they increase the expected future economic benefits attributable to the intangible asset.

(vi) Useful life and amortisation rates

Development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis from the date on which the project is
completed.

The depreciable amount of intangible assets is measured as the cost of the asset, less any residual value.

The Group reviews the residual value, useful life and amortisation method for intangible assets at each
year end. Changes to initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.

(vii) Impairment losses

The Group measures and determines impairment to be recognised or reversed based on the criteria in
section (h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation.

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(f) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Initial recognition

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of acquisition or production. Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment.

Items of property, plant and equipment recognised prior to 31 December 1996 are carried at a revalued
amount as permitted by pertinent legislation.

Spare parts used to replace similar parts in facilities, equipment and machinery are measured applying the
aforementioned criteria. Parts with a warehouse cycle of less than one year are recognised as inventories.
Parts with a warehouse cycle of more than one year and which are related to certain specific assets are
recognised and depreciated on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy for the assets in
question, and those not related to specific assets are recognised as other fixed assets and depreciated using
the same process as for the part to be replaced, if this can be identified. In general, these latter spare parts
are depreciated from the date they are incorporated into the asset, considering their technical
obsolescence and the weighted technical or economic useful life of the assets in which they are to be
incorporated.

Non-current investments in property held by the Group under operating leases are classified as property,
plant and equipment. Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful life.

(ii) Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated by allocating the depreciable amount of the asset on a
systematic basis over its useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, less its residual value.
The Group determines the depreciation charge separately for each component of an item of property,
plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the asset and with a useful
life that differs from the remainder of the asset.

Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the following criteria:

**Depreciation** **Estimated years**
**method** **of useful life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 33.33–50
Technical installations and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 5.55–10
Other installations, equipment and furniture . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 3.33–10
Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 6.25
Information technology equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 4
Other property, plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 5–6.66

The Group reviews residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods at each year end. Changes to
initially established criteria are accounted for as a change in accounting estimates.

(iii) Subsequent costs

Subsequent to initial recognition of the asset, only the costs incurred which increase capacity or
productivity or which lengthen the useful life of the asset are capitalised. The carrying amount of parts that
are replaced is derecognised. Costs of day-to-day servicing are recognised in the consolidated income
statement as incurred.

(iv) Impairment

The Group measures and determines impairment to be recognised or reversed based on the criteria in
section (h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation.

(g) Investment property

The Group classifies under this heading all investment property, including those in progress or under
development, which are totally or partially destined to obtain rental revenues, capital gains or both, instead
from its use in the production or supplying process of goods and services, or for administrative activities of
the Group or its disposal in the current fiscal year.

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Group recognizes and appraise investment property, following the established criteria for fixed assets.

Depreciation of Investment property is determined by the application of the criteria mentioned below:

**Depreciation** **Estimated years**
**method** **of useful life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Straight-line 30–50

(h) Impairment of non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation

At least at the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its
non-current assets or cash-generating units may be impaired. If any such indication exists, it estimates the
recoverable amounts of these items.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An asset is impaired
when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Value in use is the present value of the expected
future cash flows, discounted at a risk-free market interest rate and adjusted for any risks specific to the
asset. For assets which do not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets
or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating units to which these
assets belong.

Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

(i) Leases

(i) Lessee accounting

Leases in which, upon inception, the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership are classified as finance leases, otherwise they are classified as operating leases.

- _Finance leases_

At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognises finance leases as assets and liabilities at the
lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial
direct costs are added to the asset’s carrying amount. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Interest is expensed using the effective
interest method.

Contingent rents are recognised as an expense when it is probable that they will be incurred.

The accounting policies applied to the assets used by the Group by virtue of finance lease contracts are the
same as those set out in section (f). However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term, the assets are fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term
and their useful lives.

- _Operating leases_

Lease payments under an operating lease, net of incentives received, are recognised as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time
pattern of the lease’s benefit.

Contingent rents are recognised as an expense when it is probable that they will be incurred.

(j) Financial instruments

(i) Classification and separation of financial instruments

Financial instruments are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an
equity instrument in accordance with the economic substance of the contractual arrangement and the
definitions of a financial asset, a financial liability and an equity instrument.

The Group classifies financial instruments into different categories based on the nature of the instruments
and the Group’s intentions on initial recognition.

(ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables comprise trade and non-trade receivables with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market other than those classified in other financial asset categories. These
assets are initially recognised at fair value, including transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Nevertheless, financial assets which have no established interest rate, which mature or are expected to be
received in the short term, and for which the effect of discounting is immaterial, are measured at their
nominal amount.

The Group measures loans and receivables at amortised cost provided that reliable cash flow estimates can
be made based on contractual terms.

(iii) Interest and dividends

Interest is recognised using the effective interest method.

Dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised when the Group is entitled to receive
them. If the dividends are clearly derived from profits generated prior to the acquisition date because
amounts higher than the profits generated by the investment since acquisition have been distributed, the
carrying amount of the investment is reduced.

(iv) Derecognition of financial assets

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the
sum of the consideration received, net of transaction costs, including any new asset obtained less any new
liability assumed and any cumulative gain or loss deferred in recognised income and expense, is recorded
in the consolidated income statement.

(v) Investments in group companies excluded from the scope of consolidation

Investments in group companies are initially recognized at cost, which is equivalent to the fair value of the
consideration paid, and are subsequently valued at cost, less the accumulated amount of impairment
losses. Investments in group companies acquired prior to 1 January 2010 include the transaction costs
incurred in the cost of acquisition.

(vi) Impairment of financial assets

A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset and the event or events have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

The amount of the impairment loss of financial assets carried at amortised cost is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. For variable income financial assets, the effective interest rate corresponding to the
measurement date under the contractual conditions is used.

The impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and may be reversed in
subsequent periods if the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment
has been recognised. The loss can only be reversed to the limit of the amortised cost of the assets had the
impairment loss not been recognised.

(vii) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, that are not classified as held for trading or as
financial liabilities at fair value through the consolidated income statement are initially recognised at fair
value less any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. After initial
recognition, liabilities classified under this category are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Nevertheless, financial liabilities which have no established interest rate, which mature or are expected to
be settled in the short term, and for which the effect of discounting is immaterial, are measured at their
nominal amount.

The Group measures financial liabilities at amortised cost provided that reliable estimates of cash flows
can be made based on the contractual terms.

(viii)Reverse factoring

The Group has contracted reverse factoring facilities with various financial institutions to manage
payments to suppliers. Trade payables settled under the management of financial institutions are
recognised under trade and other payables in the balance sheet until they are settled, repaid or have
expired.

(ix) Security deposits

Security deposits paid are measured using the same criteria as for financial assets.

(x) Derecognition and modifications of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises all or part of a financial liability when it either discharges the liability by paying
the creditor, or is legally released from primary responsibility for the liability either by process of law or by
the creditor.

The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability, or part of a financial liability,
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the Group
transfers non-monetary assets in settlement of the debt, the difference between their fair value and their
carrying amount is recognised as results from operating activities, and the difference between the value of
the debt being settled and the fair value of the assets as net finance income/cost. If the Group transfers
inventories, the corresponding sale transaction is recognised at their fair value and the change in
inventories at their carrying amount.

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(k) Inventories

(i) General

Inventories are initially measured at cost of purchase or production.

The purchase price comprises the amount invoiced by the seller, after deduction of any discounts, rebates
or other similar items, such as interest incorporated into the nominal amount, plus any additional costs
incurred to bring the goods to a saleable condition and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition
and indirect taxes not recoverable from the Spanish taxation authorities.

Trade discounts are recognised as a reduction in the cost of inventories when it is probable that the
conditions for discounts to be received will be met. Unallocated discounts are recognised as a decrease on
the purchase.

Purchase returns are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of inventories returned, except
where it is not feasible to identify these items, in which case they are accounted for as a reduction in
inventories.

Sales returns are recognised at purchase price or cost of production, except where the net realisable value
is lower, in which case they are recognised at that amount.

The production cost of inventories comprises the purchase price of raw materials and consumables, costs
directly related to the units of production and systematic allocation of fixed and variable production
overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. The allocation of fixed indirect
overheads is based on the higher of normal production capacity or actual production.

Advances on account of inventories are measured at cost.

The cost of raw materials, other supplies and merchandise is allocated to each inventory unit on a weighted
average cost basis.

When the cost of inventories exceeds net realisable value, materials are written down to net realisable
value. For these purposes, net realisable value is understood as follows:

- For raw materials and other supplies, replacement cost. Raw materials and other supplies are not
written down below cost if the finished goods in which they will be incorporated are expected to be
sold at or above cost of production;

- For merchandise and finished goods, estimated selling price less costs to sell;

- For work in progress, estimated selling price of the related finished goods, less the estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale;

The previously recognised write-down is reversed against the consolidated income statement when the
circumstances that previously caused inventories to be written down no longer exist or when there is clear
evidence of an increase in net realisable value because of changed economic circumstances. The reversal of
the valuation adjustment is limited to the lower of the cost and the revised net realisable value of the
inventories.

Write-downs to net realisable value recognised or reversed on inventories are classified under changes in
inventories of finished goods and work in progress or supplies, depending on their nature.

(ii) Emission allowances

Emission allowances, which are recognised when the Group becomes entitled to such allowances, are
measured at cost of acquisition or production under raw materials and other supplies. Emission allowances
which are expected to be consumed within a period of more than one year are recognised under raw
materials and other supplies—long cycle. Emission allowances acquired through an onerous contract are
accounted for by applying the same criteria as for inventories. Allowances acquired free of charge, or, at a

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

price substantially lower than fair value, are carried at fair value. Any difference between fair value and the
consideration given is recognised as a non-refundable grant associated with the emission allowances and
credited to equity. These grants are recognised as income and matched with the associated costs which the
grants are intended to compensate, using the same criteria as for capital grants.

Emission allowances deriving from a certified emission reduction or an emission reduction unit, generated
through clean development mechanisms or joint implementation projects, are carried at cost of
production.

Provision is systematically made under current provisions for liabilities and charges for expenses related to
the emission of greenhouse gases. This provision is maintained until the obligation is cancelled, through
the conveyance of the corresponding allowances. Provisions released or surplus provisions reversed are
recognised as operating income. The provision is determined on the basis that it will be cancelled, as
follows:

- Firstly, through allocated emission allowances, which are then used to cancel actual emissions in
proportion to total forecast emissions for the entire period to which they have been allocated. The
expense corresponding to this part of the obligation is determined based on the carrying amount of
the transferred emission allowances;

- Secondly, through the remaining emission allowances recorded. Expenditure on this part of the
obligation is measured as the weighted average cost of the emission allowances.

If the emission of gases necessitates the acquisition or production of emission allowances because
actual emissions exceed those which can be cancelled through the allocated emission allowances, or
through surplus emission allowances, whether acquired or produced. Provision is made for the
shortfall in allowances. The expense is determined using the best estimate of the amount necessary to
cover the shortfall in emission allowances.

(l) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits in financial institutions. They also
include other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualifies as a
cash equivalent when it has a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.

The Group recognises cash payments and receipts for financial assets and financial liabilities in which
turnover is quick on a net basis in the statement of cash flows. Turnover is considered to be quick when the
period between the date of acquisition and maturity does not exceed six months.

(m) Grants, donations and bequests

Grants are recorded in recognised income and expense when, where applicable, they have been officially
awarded, the conditions attached to them have been met or there is reasonable assurance that they will be
received.

Monetary grants are measured at the fair value of the sum received, whilst non-monetary grants received
are accounted for at the fair value of the asset received.

In subsequent years, grants are recognised as income as they are applied.

Capital grants are recognised as income over the same period and in the proportions in which depreciation
on those assets is charged or when the assets are disposed of, derecognised or impaired.

Grants awarded to finance specific expenses are recognised as income when the financed expenses are
accrued.

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

(n) Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal, contractual, constructive or
tacit) as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.

If it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle an obligation, the provision is
reversed.

(o) Revenue from the sale of goods and rendering of services

Revenue from the sale of goods or services is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. Volume rebates, prompt payment and any other discounts, as well as the interest added to the
nominal amount of the consideration, are recognised as a reduction in the consideration.

Discounts granted to customers are recognised as a reduction in sales revenue when it is probable that the
discount conditions will be met.

Advances on account of future sales are measured at the value received.

(i) Revenue from sales

The Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods when:

- It has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;

- It retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership
nor effective control over the goods sold;

- The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably;

- It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and

- The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

(p) Income tax

The income tax expense or tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.

Current tax assets or liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the
taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as income or an expense and included in the consolidated income
statement for the year, except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is
recognised, in the same or a different year, directly in equity, or from a business combination.

Up until the year 2017, the Company filed consolidated tax returns with Obinesa, S.L. (Parent) and other
Mosaiq Group companies.

In addition to the factors to be considered for individual taxation, set out previously, the following factors
were taken into account when determining the accrued income tax expense for the companies which
formed the consolidated tax group:

- Temporary and permanent differences which arose from the elimination of profits and losses on
transactions between Group companies, derived from the process of determining consolidated taxable
income.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

- Deductions and credits corresponding to each company which formed the consolidated tax group. For
these purposes, deductions and credits were allocated to the company that carried out the activity or
obtained the profit necessary to obtain the right to the deduction or tax credit.

Temporary differences which arose from the elimination of profits and losses on transactions between tax
group companies were allocated to the company which recognised the profit/loss and were valued using the
tax rate of that company.

A reciprocal credit and debit arose between the companies that contribute tax losses to the consolidated
Group and the rest of the companies that offset those losses. Where a tax loss cannot be offset by the other
consolidated Group companies, these tax credits for loss carry forwards were recognised as deferred tax
assets using the applicable recognition criteria, considering the tax group as a taxable entity.

The Parent of the Tax Group recorded the total consolidated income tax payable (recoverable) with a debit
(credit) to receivables (payables) from/to Group companies and associates.

The amount of the debt (credit) relating to the subsidiaries was recognised with a credit (debit) to payables
(receivables) to/from Group companies and associates.

(i) Recognition of deferred tax liabilities

The Group recognises deferred tax liabilities in all cases except:

- where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor
taxable income;

- where they correspond to taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries,
associates and jointly-controlled entities over which the Group has the ability to control the moment
of its reversal and it is not probable that its reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

(ii) Recognition of deferred tax assets

The Group recognises deferred tax assets provided that:

- it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available against which they can be utilised or when
tax legislation envisages the possibility of converting deferred tax assets into a receivable from public
entities in the future. However, the assets arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a
transaction that is not a business combination and at the date of the transaction do not affect either
the accounting result or the taxable income, are not recognized;

- they correspond to deductible temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates
and jointly-controlled entities, to the extent that the temporary differences will revert in the
foreseeable future and it is expected to generate future tax profits in order to offset the differences.

The Group recognises the payment obligation deriving from financial contributions as an operating
expense with a credit to payables to public entities when it is accrued in accordance with the Spanish
Income Tax Law.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is not considered probable that the Group will have future
taxable profit when the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered in a period of more than ten years
from the end of the reporting period, irrespective of the nature of the deferred tax asset; or, in the case of
tax credits for deductions and other tax relief that are unused due to an insufficient amount of total tax,
when there is reasonable doubt—after the activity or the income giving rise to entitlement to the deduction
or tax credit has been rendered or received, respectively—as to whether the requirements for their offset
will be met.

**CERAMICA SALONI, S.A.U. and SUBSIDIARIES[´]**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**December 31, 2017**

**(4) Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Group only recognises deferred tax assets arising from tax loss carry forwards when it is probable that
future taxable profit will be generated against which they may be offset within the period stipulated in
applicable tax legislation, up to a maximum period of ten years, unless there is evidence that their recovery
in a longer period of time is probable and tax legislation provides for their utilisation in a longer period or
stipulates no time limit for their utilisation.

Conversely, it is considered probable that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profit to recover
deferred tax assets when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation
authority and the same taxable entity, which are expected to reverse in the same tax period as the expected
reversal of the deductible temporary differences or in periods into which a tax loss arising from a
deductible temporary difference can be carried back or forward.

The Group recognises deferred tax assets not previously recognised because they were not expected to be
utilised within the ten-year recovery period, inasmuch as the future reversal period does not exceed ten
years from the end of the reporting period or when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences.

(iii) Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the years
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted
or substantially enacted. The tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group
expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets or liabilities are also reflected in the
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

(iv) Classification

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under non-current
assets or liabilities, irrespective of the expected date of recovery or settlement.

(q) Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current

Assets and liabilities are classified as current and non-current based on the Group’s normal operating
cycle, which is no more than twelve months.

(r) Environmental issues

The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its
activities.

Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as other operating expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. Nonetheless, the Group recognises environmental provisions and, where
applicable, reimbursement rights by applying the general criteria described in the section on provisions.

Property, plant and equipment acquired by the Group for long-term use to minimise the environmental
impact of its activity and protect and improve the environment, including the reduction and elimination of
future pollution from the Group’s activities, are recognised as assets applying the measurement,
presentation and disclosure criteria described in section (f) Property, plant and equipment.

(s) Transactions between Mosaiq Group companies excluded from the consolidation group.

Transactions between Mosaiq Group companies excluded from the consolidation group, except those
related to mergers, spin-offs and non-monetary contributions, are recognised at the fair value of the
consideration given or received. The difference between this value and the amount agreed is recognised in
line with the underlying economic substance of the transaction.

**(6) Goodwill, Goodwill from Consolidated Companies and Value Impairment**

Goodwill on consolidation arises as the consequence of the existent excess, between the cost of business
combination derived from the acquisition by the Group of the 99.89% of the shares of the subsidiary
company Atlantic Tiles, and the corresponding identifiable net assets’ value of the acquiree.

At December 31, 2017, the net book value of the goodwill on consolidation is zero Euros (Euros 266,000 in
2016), having recorded an impairment for an amount of Euros 266,000 in 2017 (Euros 534,000 in 2016).

During years 2017 and 2016, the Group has impaired the Goodwill arising from the business combination
after evaluating the negative evolution of the business, sales and results, and the future forecasts that do
not contemplate the recovery of the mentioned asset.

**(7) Property, Plant and Equipment**

Details of property, plant and equipment and movements are shown in Appendix II.

(a) General

The net amount pending depreciation of property, plant and equipment from the increase in value
recorded in 1996 in accordance with Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of 7 June 1996, amounts to Euros 270,996
and Euros 294,266 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The disposal of property, plant and equipment during 2017 have resulted in a loss of an amount of Euros
224 thousand, which has been registered under the heading ‘‘Profit/Losses on disposal and other’’ in the
consolidated income statement.

(b) Property, plant and equipment acquired from Group companies

Property, plant and equipment acquired from Mosaiq Group companies at December 31, 2017 mainly
reflect land and buildings with a carrying amount of Euros 3,933,074 (Euros 4,125,694 in 2016) and other
installations, furniture and fixtures of Euros 369,184 (Euros 435,970 in 2016).

were recognised as income. The lease contract was signed in 2013 with a term of one year, which could be
extended to up to five years, and with subsequent annual renewals. In December 2016 this lease contract
was cancelled early and therefore there were no non-cancellable future minimum lease collections at
December 31, 2017.

**(12) Risk Management Policy**

(a) Financial risk factors

The Group’s activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s
global risk management programme focuses on uncertainty in the financial markets and aims to minimise
potential adverse effects on the Group’s profits.

During 2017 and 2016 risks were managed by the Finance Management of the Mosaiq Group. This
Management identifies, evaluates and mitigates financial risks in close collaboration with the Group’s
operational units. Since the acquisition mentioned in note 28 risks are managed by the Victoria Group.

(i) Currency risk

Currency risk is the risk of possible losses due to changes in the fair value of and cash flows from financial
instruments as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. The Group’s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations
arises mainly from sales performed, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency.

The Group makes sales in Euros, US Dollars and Pounds Sterling.

The Group Treasury Department is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency.

(ii) Credit risk

The Group has policies to limit the amount of risk with any one financial institution and manages its
customer portfolio adequately.

Valuation allowances for bad debts and the review of individual balances based on customers’ credit ratings
require a high degree of judgement. The credit rating of the country, based on information provided by
external agencies, is used to calculate the individual country-specific valuation allowance for bad debts.

The Group has set up an on-line consultation service with a specialised agency to assess customers’ credit
risk.

The Group has also contracted several credit insurance policies for the foreign and domestic markets,
which cover between 95% and 85%, respectively, of customer payables accepted by the insurance firm.

**(12) Risk Management Policy (Continued)**

For uninsured customers, the Group may grant credit limits in cases or circumstances where it considers
appropriate.

(iii) Liquidity risk

The Group applies a prudent policy to cover its liquidity risks based on having sufficient cash and
marketable securities, as well as sufficient financing through credit facilities, to settle market positions. The
management of the Group regularly monitors liquidity forecasts based on expected cash flows. Group
policy is to invest cash surpluses in short-term, non-speculative and highly liquid instruments, through
leading financial institutions.

(iv) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks

Income and cash flows from the Group’s operating activities are not significantly affected by fluctuations in
market interest rates.

Interest rate risk arises mainly from non-current borrowings.

**(13) Financial Assets by Category**

(a) Classification of financial assets by category

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 all financial assets are loans, receivables, and equity investments. The

**(16) Equity (Continued)**

At December 31, 2016 all of the Parent Company’s shares were pledged to ensure compliance with formal
obligations and repayment of loans from the previous Framework Refinancing Agreement. These
guarantees were cancelled in 2017.

(b) Reserves

(i) Legal reserve

The legal reserve has been appropriated in compliance with article 274 of the Revised Spanish Companies
Act, which requires that companies transfer 10% of profits for the year to a legal reserve until this reserve
reaches an amount equal to 20% of share capital.

The legal reserve is not distributable to shareholders and if it is used to offset losses, in the event that no
other reserves are available, the reserve must be replenished with future profits.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016 the Group has appropriated to the legal reserve the minimum amount
required by law.

(ii) Voluntary reserves

These reserves are freely distributable.

On September 30, 2017 and December 11, 2017, a contract and an addendum thereto were signed
establishing the sale of receivables from third parties held by the Parent Company for a total amount of
Euros 6,160 thousand to the parent of the Mosaiq Group. In accordance with the accounting principles
and criteria contained in the applicable financial reporting framework, the difference between the carrying
amount and the sale price is recognised with a charge to reserves.

(c) Dividends/Interim dividend

On December 18, 2017, the sole shareholder of the Parent Company approved the distribution of a
dividend in kind with a charge to voluntary reserves of Euros 17,439,715. On December 31, 2017 the sole
shareholder approved the distribution of an additional dividend in kind with a charge to voluntary reserves
of Euros 16,157,446 and a dividend on account of profits for 2017 of Euros 17,345,622.

The amount of the dividend on account to be distributed does not exceed the amount of profits obtained
since the end of the previous year, less the amounts that should be allocated to mandatory or statutory
reserves, prior years’ losses, and the estimated income tax payable for these profits.

These distributions of dividends were carried out by offsetting balances receivable from a current account
with the Mosaiq Group companies by the aforementioned amounts. As the distribution of the dividend on
account of 2017 profits is in kind, comprising a receivable, it does not affect the liquidity of the Parent
Company. These distributions of dividends were carried out by virtue of the agreements to offset and
eliminate balances and transactions with the Mosaiq Group companies set out in the Framework
Refinancing Agreement entered into in 2017.

At December 31, 2017 other payables to Group companies mainly comprised payables arising from the tax
effect of filing consolidated tax returns. This balance was payable to Obinesa, S.L., the head of the tax
group. At December 31, 2016 other payables to Group companies mainly corresponded to unpaid balances
related to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.

Payables non-current and current included the balance amount at December 31, 2017 of the loan granted
by an affiliated company of the Atiltan Group (Balaenoptera Borealis Loans, S.L.U.). In the context of the
arrival of Atitlan Group (see note 1) and the Group’s Refinancing Contract (see note 20.c), a participating
loan of Euros 50 million was arranged on December 18, 2017. The initial term of the loan was two years,
which may be extended up to five years. Nevertheless, it must remain in force and will be understood to be
automatically extended for the outstanding balance until working capital funding has been repaid under
the terms of the Framework Refinancing Agreement. This loan accrued fixed interest tied to Euribor plus
a spread, and variable interest linked to the Company’s EBITDA. Furthermore, a minimum amount of
accrued interest and a maximum amount of interest payments were stipulated for the first two years in
accordance with the provisions of the Framework Refinancing Agreement. The borrower has undertaken
to use the proceeds from the loan for the partial repayment of the initial debt of the Mosaiq Group under
the terms stipulated in the Framework Refinancing Agreement. As mentioned in note 28, this loan and its
accrued interest has been repaid by the Victoria Group.

in 2016. Loans from public entities are used to finance certain innovation projects and machinery.

At December 31, 2017, loans and borrowings include discount lines for an amount of Euros 3,410,932
(Euros 117,961 in 2016) (see note 20.c) and bank loans for an amount of Euros 152,183. As a consequence
of the agreed debt release in the new Agreement which is detailed in note 20.c, during 2017 the Group has
cancelled bank debts, recording a financial income by an amount of Euros 22,016,308. The remaining
amount of non-current bank debt was transferred to the current account with Obinesa, the Mosaiq Group
company in charge of repayment of the new negotiated debt.

(c) Other information on payables

(i) Main characteristics of payables

On August 8, 2017 the Mosaiq Group formalised a new Framework Refinancing Agreement with a
syndicate of financial institutions in order to restructure its financial debt, aligning it with its short- and
medium-term financing needs, and to pave the way for the arrival of a new investor to the Mosaiq Group.
As part of the renegotiation of its financial debt, Mosaiq Group management approved a new Business
Plan which was drawn up in collaboration with independent experts and which will ensure the survival and
stability of the Mosaiq Group’s activity in the short-, medium- and long-term.

The Framework Refinancing Agreement was signed by a number of financial institutions representing over
80% of the Group’s financial debt, and the Mosaiq Group therefore applied for a court-sanctioned
workout to make the terms of the Framework Refinancing Agreement applicable to non-signatory
institutions. On September 15, 2017 the Mosaiq Group filed an application with the Castell´on Commercial
Court for a court-sanctioned workout of the Framework Refinancing Agreement. On October 11, 2017 the
Castell´on Commercial Court issued an injunction extending the financial restructuring agreement for all
intents and purposes to the institutions that had not subscribed the agreement. The injunction for the
court-sanctioned workout was published in the Official State Gazette on October 17, 2017. Once the
period of 15 business days following the publication in the Official State Gazette has elapsed without the
creditors affected by the court-sanctioned workout that have not subscribed the financial restructuring
agreement impugning the court injunction, the court-sanctioned workout should be considered final.

The conclusion of the aforementioned court-sanctioned workout forms part of the condition precedent
established in the Framework Refinancing Agreement. The rest of the terms of the condition precedent of
the Framework Refinancing Agreement were considered to have been met on December 18, 2017, the date
on which the Refinancing Agreement went into effect.

**(20) Payables and Trade and other payables (Continued)**

The main terms of the Refinancing Agreement are as follows:

- On entry into force of the Refinancing Agreement, the Mosaiq Group paid the creditor financial
institutions that signed the Agreement Euros 58 million as partial repayment of its financial debt. For
the remaining debt, which amounted to Euros 413 million, not including revolving credit facilities or
ring-fenced property, debt amounting to Euros 8 million was novated along with the associated
conditions. The financial institutions granted a waiver for the entire outstanding balance of Euros
346 million, which was recognised as finance income in the Mosaiq Group consolidated income
statement. At year end, the novated debt was partially repaid, leaving an outstanding balance at
December 31, 2017 of Euros 697 thousand.

- The Refinancing Agreement stipulates that the financial institutions must maintain the current limits
on the revolving credit facilities granted to certain Group companies for a three-year period.

- The Refinancing Agreement, once the debt has been partially repaid, cancels all mortgage and
personal guarantees and pledged assets related to Mosaiq Group’s initial debt granted to ensure
fulfilment of the obligations of any Mosaiq Group company under the previous refinancing
agreements.

- In addition, it stipulates that the Mosaiq Group must fulfil certain formal obligations vis-`a-vis the
creditor entities, as well as certain financial ratios or covenants for the years ended on or after

associates, current liabilities.

At December 31, 2017, the Tax Group in which Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. and other companies taxed in
Spain are integrated into, had the following main applicable taxes open to inspection by the Spanish
taxation authorities:

Nonetheless, the taxation authorities’ right to examine or investigate tax loss carry forwards (whether
available or already offset), double taxation relief and tax credits aimed at incentivising certain activities
(whether applied or available) becomes statute-barred ten years as from the day after the filing deadline
for the tax return or self-assessment for the tax period in which the right of offset or application was
generated. After this period, the Group must justify the tax loss carry forwards or tax credits by presenting
the assessment or self-assessment and its accounts, together with evidence of their having been filed during
the aforementioned period at the Mercantile Registry.

Due to different possible interpretations of prevailing tax legislation, additional tax liabilities could arise in
the event of inspection. In any event, any such liabilities that could arise are not expected to have a
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.

(a) Income tax

The Parent Company filed consolidated tax returns with Obinesa Group, S.L. (parent) and other Group
companies.

A reconciliation of net income and expenses with taxable income for the year is shown in Appendix IV.

The relationship between the tax expense/(income) and accounting profit/(loss) for the year is provided in

The Group decided to recognise deferred tax assets, which mainly reflect tax loss carry forwards generated
in prior years, on the assumption that it will be able to apply them based on the tax Group’s future earnings
projections, fulfil the business plan drawn up by Mosaiq Group management for the coming years and sign
the refinancing agreement with the financial institutions mentioned in note 20.c).

During 2017, the Spanish tax group has offset tax loss carryforwards from previous financial years that
were recorded as deferred tax assets amounting to Euros 5.9 million.

Certain Group companies domiciled outside of Spain have offset tax losses from previous years, the tax
effect of which was not recorded as deferred tax assets, amounting to approximately Euros 1.4 million.

_Change of control and financing of the acquisition._

On August 7, 2018, Victoria PLC (Victoria), through an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary named

In connection with the above, several contracts and agreements between Victoria PLC, Sandover and

As a result of the early repayment by Victoria of the PPL between Balaenoptera Borealis Loans, S.L.U.

profit participating loan with Saloni (the ‘‘New PPL’’) for an amount equal to the outstanding amount of
the previous PPL (thus, Euros 52,380,617.22) and whose terms and conditions were similar to those of the
current PPL.

In addition, as a result of that early repayment of the previous PPL between Cer´amica Saloni and BBL,
certain cancellation costs amounting to Euros 8,634,382.78 have been paid to BBL. Victoria funded this
amount to Cer´amica Saloni, S.A.U. by means of a shareholder’s loan.
